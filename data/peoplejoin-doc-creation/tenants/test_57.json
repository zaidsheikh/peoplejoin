of the performers were shot in the altercation that happened inside the excalibur hotel and casino tuesday night . officers were called to the property just before 9 : 30 p.m.         according to an arrest report , the man was witnessed wandering around the backstage and auditorium area of the show wearing a swat hat and shoes and a firefighter ' s shirt .     several people noticed him but just assumed he was a new dancer .     as the dancers began dressing for the show , several of them noticed they were missing pieces of their costumes and makeup .     one of the dancers noticed a suitcase

and said , \" what are you doing ? i just bought all that stuff for my girlfriend . \"     at that point , a struggle between several dancers and doe ensued . doe said , \" i got a gun . i ' m gonna shoot , \" pulled a .44 magnum handgun out and pointed it at a dancer ' s head , the report stated .     someone pushed the gun away from the dancer ' s head just as a round was fired . it struck a wall . the dancers continued struggling with doe until he was detained by security and eventually taken into custody by metro officers .     the man identified himself to police as michael maharas , but that identity was never confirmed . a search of clark county detention center records , though , showed charges connected to the incident under the name joey kadmiri , 24.         doe was taken to

world , has been solved , two researchers claimed at an international conference of scholars friday .     the fort vanished , seemingly forever , soon after the spanish wiped it out 448 years ago . its location has been the most enduring puzzle in jacksonville , where for more than a century amateurs and professionals have searched for it in vain .     they could keep looking for another century and still never find it , say scholars fletcher crowe and anita spring ,     that \u2019 s because the fort was not in jacksonville . it wasn \u2019 t even in florida .     instead , they claim , it is 70 miles north , on the altamaha river , south of darien , ga.     crowe and spring , who is a professor emeritus of anthropology at the university of florida , presented their findings at florida state university . they spoke to academics from around the world , gathered for a conference called la floride francaise : florida , france , and the francophone world .     robert \u201cbuzz \u201d thunen , a university of north florida archaeologist who \u2019 s been searching for fort caroline in jacksonville , was at the conference . he was skeptical of their findings .     \u201cit \u2019 s a provocative presentation , \u201d he said . \u201ci don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s enough of an argument for me to change my mind. \u201d     however , if they are right , that means that everything we know about the first recorded history in the area is dead wrong .     if they are right , that means that everything named after fort caroline in jacksonville is misnamed .     that anything named mayport \u2014 from the french river of may , what was thought to be the st. johns river \u2014 shouldn \u2019 t be .     that ribault high school in jacksonville is named after a french navigator who passed up this area in favor of georgia .     that jacksonville can no longer claim the glory of being the site of the first european effort to establish a fortified settlement in what would become america .     if they are right .     \u201cwe don \u2019 t have archaeological proof of the fort at this time , \u201d crowe said . \u201cthat \u2019 s not to say we don \u2019 t have just reams and reams of material , but having reams of 8 1/2-inch paper filled with words is far different from having a french cannonball. \u201d     added spring : \u201cwe haven \u2019 t found [ the fort ] , but we are pretty much closing in on the site . we have a pretty good idea where it is. \u201d     she said she would have liked to have kept their findings secret for a few more months . but they decided the conference in tallahassee on france and florida was the perfect place to present their idea , in an hourlong presentation with 100 powerpoint slides .     crowe said their presentation friday provoked many questions from the academics gathered there , as he expected with such an unconventional idea .     the purpose , he said , was to be challenged , and have those challenges help guide their future research . he said they remain confident , however , that they are correct .     spring , the uf professor , has homes in gainesville and st. augustine .     it gives her no joy , she said , to claim that georgia is home to the ancient settlement , which was founded before st. augustine , before the lost colony of roanoke , jamestown or plymouth .     \u201ci wish it was in florida , \u201d she said . \u201cthis chagrins me , really. \u201d     she said she and crowe have a special-use permit from the state of georgia to search where they believe fort caroline is . that permit does not allow them to pinpoint the location of the dig , to prevent looters from getting there first .     they \u2019 re getting additional funding and expect to begin digging within a few months , spring said .     crowe has a doctorate in history from fsu and can read ancient french . he put that skill to use in libraries in france , reading old documents related to the expedition .     there , he says , he found a poor translation from the french , a translation made more than 400 years ago . that led to confusion between the words \u201cabove \u201d and \u201cbelow \u201d the line of 30 degrees of latitude , which is roughly where jacksonville is .     crowe claims that bad translation became accepted as fact , and flourished for centuries .     \u201cwe \u2019 re claiming that the whole myth that fort caroline is east of jacksonville is based on poor translations , \u201d he said .     crowe and spring say they also re-examined ancient maps , some of which had labeled the altamaha as the river may , which has long been thought to be the french name for the st. johns .     various geographical puzzles in the early writings of the french suddenly make sense when one looks at the maps knowing that fort caroline was on the altamaha , spring said .     and linguistic evidence , looking at indian words described by the french , shows that the language the natives were speaking was from georgia , not florida , spring added .     their theory that fort caroline is on the altamaha is not new . a writer named richard thornton also made that claim in various postings on the internet .     crowe and spring , though , say the evidence they \u2019 ve amassed will prove overwhelming .     \u201ci predict this will be just as controversial as saying that gravity doesn \u2019 t exist , \u201d crowe said . \u201cit \u2019 ll be just totally contradictory to what the jacksonville chamber of commerce says , to what historians say. \u201d     spring said the confusion is understandable , given the conventional wisdom that fort caroline was on the st. johns .     \u201cyou \u2019 ve got the best people looking for it , \u201d she said . \u201csome of those people are my colleagues , and others i know . and they are terrific archaeologists and they have worked on it for a long time. \u201d     thunen , the unf archaeologist , presented a paper to the same conference , arguing that fort caroline is on the st. johns \u2014 it just hasn \u2019 t been found yet . thunen and his unf colleague keith ashley have been searching for years .     he noted that this year is the 450th anniversary of the founding of the fort .     \u201cthat fuels the fascination of the general public . there are a lot of people who are interested in finding the fort . it is , for floridians , a sort of anchor into the recorded past and , for jacksonvillians , it is a source of civic pride. \u201d     thunen said that , without any physical evidence to prove otherwise , there \u2019 s not enough in crowe and springs \u2019 report to change his mind on the fort \u2019 s location .     he believes they rely too heavily on maps that can be interpreted in different ways , and says their findings don \u2019 t seem to jibe with the \u201chistorical context \u201d of european contact with the native people .     \u201cit never hurts to question our assumptions , \u201d he said . \u201cand what it does for me is to help sharpen my resolve and focus , helps me to re-look at the documents. \u201d     there is one key fact of history that indeed suggests fort caroline was in jacksonville : the bloody end of the french fort in 1565.     that \u2019 s when spanish troops marched overland to the fort from their newly founded camp at st. augustine , slogging through a hurricane for several days .     if the fort were indeed in georgia , how could that march have been made in that time ? how could the spanish have crossed the st. johns ?     crowe acknowledged those questions . \u201canyone who makes [ our ] claim has to establish how the spanish were able to march overland to the fort , \u201d he said .     crowe and spring say they believe they have an answer : the spanish actually marched from a camp on the st. marys river in georgia , following indian trails that led them to the fort on the altamaha .     once there , the slaughter began .     matt soergel : ( 904 ) 359-4082\n"}], "farshid": [{"url": "file://test/57/0/0", "title": "test/57/0/0", "content": "since posting our first update , we have been working as quickly as possible to establish the facts of last week \u2019 s accident . our hearts are with the family and friends who have been affected by this tragedy .     the safety of our customers is our top priority , which is why we are working closely with investigators to understand what happened , and what we can do to prevent this from happening in the future . after the logs from the computer inside the vehicle were recovered , we have more information about what may have happened .     in the moments before the collision , which occurred at 9 : 27 a.m. on friday , march 23rd , autopilot was engaged with the adaptive cruise control follow-distance set to minimum . the driver had received several visual and one audible hands-on warning earlier in the drive and the driver \u2019 s hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision . the driver had about five seconds and 150 meters of unobstructed view of the concrete divider with the crushed crash attenuator , but the vehicle logs show that no action was taken .     the reason this crash was so severe is because the crash attenuator , a highway safety barrier which is designed to reduce the impact into a concrete lane divider , had been crushed in a prior accident without being replaced . we have never seen this level of damage to a model x in any other crash .     over a year ago , our first iteration of autopilot was found by the u.s. government to reduce crash rates by as much as 40 % . internal data confirms that recent updates to autopilot have improved system reliability .     in the us , there is one automotive fatality every 86 million miles across all vehicles from all manufacturers . for tesla , there is one fatality , including known pedestrian fatalities , every 320 million miles in vehicles equipped with autopilot hardware . if you are driving a tesla equipped with autopilot hardware , you are 3.7 times less likely to be involved in a fatal accident .     tesla autopilot does not prevent all accidents \u2013 such a standard would be impossible \u2013 but it makes them much less likely to occur . it unequivocally makes the world safer for the vehicle occupants , pedestrians and cyclists .     no one knows about the accidents that didn \u2019 t happen , only the ones that did . the consequences of the public not using autopilot , because of an inaccurate belief that it is less safe , would be extremely severe . there are about 1.25 million automotive deaths worldwide . if the current safety level of a tesla vehicle were to be applied , it would mean about 900,000 lives saved per year . we expect the safety level of autonomous cars to be 10 times safer than non-autonomous cars .     in the past , when we have brought up statistical safety points , we have been criticized for doing so , implying that we lack empathy for the tragedy that just occurred . nothing could be further from the truth . we care deeply for and feel indebted to those who chose to put their trust in us . however , we must also care about people now and in the future whose lives may be saved if they know that autopilot improves safety . none of this changes how devastating an event like this is or how much we feel for our customer ' s family and friends . we are incredibly sorry for their loss .\n"}, {"url": "file://test/57/0/2", "title": "test/57/0/2",
