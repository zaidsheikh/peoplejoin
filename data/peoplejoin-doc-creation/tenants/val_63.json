any ecosystem on the planet \u2014 a recent report described some 400 new species discovered in the amazon between 2014 and 2015 alone \u2014 yet is rapidly vanishing with increasing global demand for resources . the economy , essentially focused on the exploitation of natural resources , minerals and agribusiness , has already led to about 20 percent of original forest cover to be replaced by pastures and agricultural crops , without securing the well-being of the local population . the reforestation project fills an urgent need to develop the region \u2019 s economy without destroying its forests and ensuring the well-being of its people .     protect an acre donate to ci to help us achieve zero net deforestation in amazonia by 2020. donate     \u201ca new chapter is being written for

plan , over the next six years , the amazon rainforest will get 73 million new trees . the mass planting is part of a project sponsored by conservation international , the brazilian ministry of environment , and a number of other ngos and corporations . as john converse townsend at fast company reports , it is the largest tropical reforestation effort ever attempted .     according to a press release from conservation international , the effort will span deforested pasture lands over a 74,000-acre region spanning several brazilian states \u2014 with the greatest focus in southern amazonas , rond\u00f4nia , acre , par\u00e1 and the xingu watershed . the purpose of the project is , in part , to revive the 20 percent of the amazon that has been lost to deforestation due to agriculture and pasturing during the last 40 years . but the effort is also geared toward learning how to restore tropical forests .     \u201cthis is a breathtakingly audacious project , \u201d says m. sanjayan , ceo of conservation international , according to the release . \u201cthe fate of the amazon depends on getting this right \u2014 as do the region \u2019 s 25 million residents , its countless species and the climate of our planet. \u201d     as townsend reports , reforestation efforts are typically very costly and time consuming \u2014 requiring people to both grow and plant thousands of saplings , many of which will not survive . in this latest effort , the restorationists are trying a new method called muvuca , in which they will spread the seeds of native trees across the slash and burned land and animal pastures . the seeds come from the xingu seed network , which uses a coalition of 400 collectors to gather the seeds from native trees .     \u201cwith plant-by-plant reforestation techniques , you get a typical density of about 160 plants per hectare , \u201d rodrigo medeiros , vice president of conservation international \u2019 s brazil program , tells townsend . \u201cwith muvuca , the initial outcome is 2,500 [ trees ] per hectare . and after 10 years , you can reach 5,000 trees per hectare . it \u2019 s much more diverse , much more dense , and less expensive than traditional techniques. \u201d     the muvuca experiment is the beginning of a massive effort announced by brazil to restore 12 million hectares of forest , an area the size of pennsylvania , as part of an effort to reach their climate change goals under the paris accord . recent studies show that second growth forests \u2014 those less than 60 years old that grow after logging or land clearance \u2014 can sequester huge amounts of carbon . as townsend reports , just stopping current deforestation could help mitigate 37 percent of current carbon emissions . planting or restoring forests could make that number even bigger .     while the effort is impressive , it \u2019 s not the largest reforestation effort in the world . in july , 2016 , 800,000 people in uttar pradesh , india , planted 50 million trees in just 24 hours , a publicity stunt to highlight india \u2019 s paris accord commitment to reforest 12 percent of its land by 2030. the world \u2019 s largest program , however , is china \u2019 s grain-for-green effort , a plan to restore 69.2 million acres of forest land , which is an area the size of new york and pennsylvania combined .     all of these efforts are encouraging , but replanting is only half of the solution . twenty-five million acres of forests are cleared each year , writes doug boucher , director of climate research and analysis at the union of concerned scientists . he points out that while the long-term benefits of reforestation are helpful for the climate , the decades it takes for forests to regrow means it will take a while to see benefits . this means other more immediate solutions , such as reducing industrial emissions and halting the removal of forests , are still necessary to make a dent in our changing climate .\n"}, {"url": "file://val/63/1/3", "title": "val/63/1/3", "content": "image copyright afp image caption more than 21 million people in yemen are in need of help , according to the un

violence , a bomb exploded next to the governor ' s office in the southern city of aden , killing four people .     sally nabil , bbc correspondent in aden     although the fighting is over , the humanitarian situation in aden remains dire . pro-government forces have driven out the iranian-backed houthi rebels but the people are in desperate need .     many of the residential neighbourhoods have been reduced to ruins and thousands of yemenis are still living in schools and mosques , with little access to food , water or medicine . there is no sign they are going to return home any time soon .     a lot of areas around the city are full of landmines and explosive devices . one lady told me her neighbour went back to check his house after the fighting stopped , but the moment he opened the door an explosion was triggered . she said she doesn ' t want to face the same fate .     as we walked around aden , we saw some neighbourhoods overflowing with sewage water . parents say their children are suffering from malaria , diarrhoea and skin diseases .     hospitals are overwhelmed with war casualties who don ' t receive adequate medical treatment . many die on their way to the medical facilities because ambulances are poorly equipped . doctors say many victims need to be taken abroad because their conditions are too serious to be treated in yemen .     last month , government forces retook aden from the houthis in a major setback for the rebels .     meanwhile , un humanitarian chief stephen o ' brien , who has also just returned from yemen , told the un security council on wednesday that \" the scale of human suffering is almost incomprehensible \" .     he also strongly criticised the saudi-led coalition in yemen for bombing the port of hodeida ,

   as grim as the humanitarian situation is in yemen , the wfp stops short of declaring a famine there in its latest update .     the un uses the term sparingly and will only declare a famine once certain conditions are met .     they are : over 20 % of households in an area face extreme food shortages with a limited ability to cope ; acute malnutrition rates exceed 30 % ; and the death rate exceeds two per day per 10,000 people .     calling the situation in yemen a famine would instantly raise awareness , but that labelling makes little difference to the yemeni people already suffering

july 2011 \u0096 for many months united nations aid agencies have warned of an impending crisis in the horn of africa as drought , failed harvests and fighting in some areas led to increasing food insecurity . now conditions are so grim that the un has turned to a word it uses sparingly and specifically \u2013 famine .     yesterday the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ( ocha ) declared that a famine exists in two regions of southern somalia , and warned that the famine could soon spread to the rest of southern somalia .     while many countries worldwide face food security crises , with large numbers of people hungry and unable to find enough food , only rarely do the conditions meet the humanitarian community \u2019 s formal criteria for a famine . the last time it was used in somalia , for example , was in 1991-92 , despite several periods of protracted drought and other problems in the intervening years .     a famine can be declared only when certain measures of mortality , malnutrition and hunger are met . they are : at least 20 per cent of households in an area face extreme food shortages with a limited ability to cope ; acute malnutrition rates exceed 30 per cent ; and the death rate exceeds two persons per day per 10,000 persons .     other factors considered in these areas of somalia include large-scale displacement , widespread destitution , disease outbreaks and social collapse .     the definition has been developed through the work of the integrated food security phase classification ( ipc ) , which includes specialists from humanitarian agencies , including the un food and agriculture organization ( fao ) and the un world food programme ( wfp ) , as well as leading non-governmental organizations ( ngos ) and government aid agencies .     the gathering of data to determine whether the criteria are met is in this case in the hands of the un-backed food security and nutrition analysis unit-somalia ( fsnau ) , which is administered by fao . fsnau then passes the information to the un , aid agencies and the united states famine early warning systems network ( fews net ) .     the declaration of a famine carries no binding obligations on the un or member states , but serves to focus global attention on the problem .     according to wfp , famines have been declared previously in southern areas of sudan in 2008 ; in gode in the somali region of ethiopia in 2000 ; in the democratic people \u2019 s republic of korea ( dprk ) in 1996 ; in somalia in 1991-1992 , and ethiopia in 1984-1985 .\n"},
