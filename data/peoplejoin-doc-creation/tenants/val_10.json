( associated press )     iguala , mexico ( ap ) \u2014 a clandestine grave on the outskirts of a mexican city where police clashed with student protesters a week ago contained 28 bodies but the remains are too damaged for immediate identification , state officials said .     guerrero state prosecutor inaky blanco said he could not say whether any of the dead could be some of the 43 college students reported missing after the violent confrontation in iguala , located about 120 miles ( 200 kilometers ) south of mexico city .     he said genetic testing of the remains could take two weeks to two months .     blanco said one of the people detained in the case had told investigators that 17 students were taken to the grave site on the outskirts of the iguala and killed there . but he stressed that investigators had not confirmed the person ' s story .     \" as long as the identity of the cadavers has not been resolved we will continue the search \" for the missing students , he said sunday .     state police and prosecutors have been investigating the iguala city police for misconduct during a series of violent incidents last weekend that resulted in six shooting deaths and more than two dozen people injured . investigators said video showed police taking away an undetermined number of student protesters .     authorities have presented charges against 29 people in the case , including 22 police officers detained soon after the violence . three of the suspects are fugitives , including iguala ' s police chief .     blanco said they are still investigating the motive for the crime , adding that some of the police have connections to a local drug cartel .     blanco said saturday that some of those arrested provided key clues that led investigators to the six unmarked burial pits on an isolated hillside about a mile ( 2 kilometers ) from the nearest road . the bodies had been put in the pits on top of branches and tree trunks , which were doused with a flammable substance such as gasoline and set on fire .     vidulfo rosales , a lawyer helping families of the missing students , said relatives of 37 of the young people already had provided dna samples that will be used to determine if the recovered remains belong to any of the students .     as investigators worked at the grave site , up to 2,000 protesters blocked a main highway in the state capital of chilpancingo demanding justice . \" you took them alive , we want them returned alive , \" read a huge banner hung across the road linking mexico city and acapulco .     the mother of one of the missing youths said her son , 17-year-old luis angel abarca carrillo , had enrolled in the aytozinapa teachers college attended by the missing students in order to get ahead in life and not be a poor farmer like his brothers .     \" but now look what they did to him , he hasn ' t reappeared , \" said 60-year-old margarita carrillo .     mexico ' s national human rights commission opened its own investigation into the case for possible \" serious human rights abuses , \" such as extrajudicial executions and forced disappearances by iguala city police .     the commission said in a statement sunday that it had warned about the \" delicate \" situation in guerrero , a southern state where poverty feeds social unrest and drug gangs clash over territory .     anger over the discovery of the graves exploded saturday night when a group of young people from the aytozinapa teachers college protested outside the governor ' s residence in chilpancingo . they threw molotov cocktails and overturned a car after state officials told them they would not be allowed to travel to the graves to determine if the bodies are those of their missing classmates .     like many other

was it a healing ground ? we don \u2019 t know , for sure . we know that people were buried there , and that the stones are aligned in astronomically important ways . we also understand , because of the chemical composition of animal bones found nearby and the provenance of the stones , that people traveled hundreds of miles to visit stonehenge . but we cannot say , with certainty , why .     try a simpler question : how did the bluestones , which weigh between four and eight tons apiece , arrive at the site , nearly 5,000 years ago , from 170 miles away in west wales ? land or sea ? both alternatives explode with possibilities , and nobody has an impregnable theory . mike parker pearson of university college london is working on a new idea that the bluestones might have been lifted onto huge wooden lattices and carried by dozens of men to the site . but it \u2019 s just a theory . we can \u2019 t know , definitively . we can only have better-informed questions .     the ineffability of stonehenge has not dulled our appetite . the site has long proved irresistible to diggers . in 1620 , the duke of buckingham had his men excavate right in the center of the monument . although they did not know it at the time , they dug on the site of a prehistoric pit . buckingham \u2019 s men found skulls of cattle \u201cand other beasts \u201d and large quantities of \u201cburnt coals or charcoals \u201d \u2014 but no treasure , as they had hoped .     in the 19th century , \u201cbarrow-digging , \u201d or the excavation of prehistoric monuments and burial hills , was a popular pastime among the landed gentry . in 1839 , a naval officer named captain beamish dug out an estimated 400 cubic feet of soil from the northeast of the altar stone at stonehenge . as parker pearson notes in his book stonehenge , beamish \u2019 s \u201cbig hole was probably the final blow for any prehistoric features ... that once lay at stonehenge \u2019 s center. \u201d     work at stonehenge became less invasive . in 1952 , willard libby \u2014 the american chemist and later a nobel prize winner \u2014 used his new radiocarbon dating technique on a piece of charcoal from a pit within stonehenge to date the monument to 1848 b.c. , give or take 275 years . that date has since been refined several times . the prevailing opinion is that the first stones were erected on the site around 2600 b.c . ( although the building of stonehenge was carried out over a millennium , and there were centuries of ritual activity at the site before the stones were in place ) .     in 2003 , parker pearson conducted his own survey , concentrating on the nearby settlement at durrington walls and the area between there and the river avon . based on huts , tools and animal bones he uncovered , he concluded that durrington walls likely housed the workers who built stonehenge . based on an analysis of human remains he later excavated from stonehenge , he also surmised that , far from being a site of quotidian religious activity , stonehenge served as a cemetery \u2013 a \u201cplace for the dead. \u201d     the stonehenge hidden landscapes project is different from everything that came before it . when gaffney and his team started their work , they were less interested in theories than in data . to that end , they concentrated on taking what amounts to a three-dimensional and yards-deep photograph of the entire landscape . \u201cthe perceived wisdom was driven by the monuments we knew about , \u201d says gaffney . \u201cwe \u2019 ve put in the data between the monuments. \u201d     ***     chris gaffney , vince \u2019 s younger , slighter and less voluble brother , was one of the instigators of this new approach . the duo \u2019 s grandfather was a metalwork teacher from newcastle with an interest in archaeology , who took his clever grandchildren on trips to hadrian \u2019 s wall , the old barrier between the roman empire and the blasted north . small wonder that vince became an archaeologist and chris a geophysicist , now at the university of bradford .     the gaffney brothers \u2019 interest in new technologies that were becoming available to archaeologists led them to the first gps-guided magnetometer systems . a magnetometer has sensors that allow a geophysicist to see evidence of historic building , and even ancient ditch-digging , beneath the soil by mapping variations in the earth \u2019 s magnetic field . the gps-guided versions were able to pinpoint some of those discoveries to within one centimeter . the gaffneys believed that stonehenge scholarship needed a massive magnetometer- and radar-led survey of the whole site . \u201cwe just didn \u2019 t know if anything \u2019 s there , \u201d vince gaffney recalled . \u201cso we \u2019 re constructing various hypotheses on the basis of something we don \u2019 t know. \u201d     around the same time , an austrian archaeologist named wolfgang neubauer , now of the boltzmann institute , was hoping to conduct large-scale projects all over europe using tools including gps magnetometers and ground-penetrating radar . neubauer \u2019 s team had also developed software to process the 40 or 50 gigabytes of raw data that these instruments could create in a day . suddenly , instead of waiting weeks or months to see what the machines had found , it was possible to cover several acres with magnetometers and radar in a day and to display that information on a screen almost instantaneously .     one of the areas neubauer wanted to scan was stonehenge , and in the spring of 2009 he contacted vince gaffney . a few months later , the boltzmann institute and the university of birmingham \u2014 plus several other british and european universities , museums and companies that contributed expertise and resources \u2014 began their collaboration at stonehenge .     their first days on site , gaffney recalled , were \u201clike a geophysical circus has come to town. \u201d tractors pushed the ground-penetrating radars , which looked like high-powered lawn mowers . all-terrain vehicles dragged the magnetometer sensors on long strings . delicate instruments covering hard , uneven ground kept mechanics and technicians busy . \u201ci have seen one of our magnetometers shear clear apart in front of me , \u201d said gaffney . \u201cit was back in service the next day. \u201d in all , the fieldwork took about 120 days , spread over four years .     ***     in a multimedia room at the university of birmingham there was a vast touch screen , six feet by nine , on which a new map of the stonehenge landscape appeared . gaffney pointed out the key features .     there was stonehenge itself , marked by the familiar circles . to the north was the long , thin strip called the stonehenge cursus or the greater cursus , which was demarcated by ditches , and ran east to west for nearly two miles . ( the cursus was given its name by the antiquarian william stukeley in the 18th century because it looked like an ancient roman race course . its construction predates the first building work at stonehenge by several hundred years. ) gaffney also pointed out the cursus barrows \u2014 hillocks containing mass human graves \u2014 just south of the cursus itself , and king barrow ridge to the east .     scattered all over the map were blotches of black : features without names . these were new finds , including the more than 15 possible new or poorly understood neolithic monuments . gaffney emphasized possible , acknowledging that it will require digging \u2014 \u201cthe testimony of the spade \u201d \u2014 to discover precisely what was there .     standing in front of this constellation of evidence , he seemed unable to decide where to start , like a child at the christmas tree . \u201cthese are little henge monuments , \u201d he said , touching the screen to highlight a group of black smudges . \u201cnice little entrance there , and a ditch . these things we know nothing about. \u201d     he saved his greatest enthusiasm for the discoveries that had been made in the cursus . this feature , said gaffney , had always been thought of as a \u201cbloody great barrier to the north of stonehenge. \u201d nobody knew quite what it was for . because the cursus runs east to west , archaeologists have always believed that its presence owes something to the passage of the sun . the monument must be significant : it was dug in the fourth millennium b.c . using antler picks \u2014 hundreds of thousands of man-hours went into its construction .     the hidden landscapes project \u2019 s instruments discovered several new clues . first of all , they found gaps in the ditch , in particular a very large break in the northern side , to allow people to enter and exit the cursus . now , instead of seeing the cursus exclusively as a monument that encouraged movement along the path of the sun , east to west , gaffney began to consider these gaps as \u201cchannels through the landscape \u201d to guide the movement of people north to south .     a bigger discovery , gaffney says , was a \u201cbloody huge \u201d pit about five yards in diameter at the eastern end of the cursus . today it lies buried at least three feet below the surface of the ground . such a pit was much too large for a practical use \u2014 for instance , burying trash \u2014 because of the labor involved in digging it . in the archaeologists \u2019 minds it could only have ritual implications , as \u201ca marker of some kind , \u201d gaffney said . what \u2019 s more , if you drew a straight line between the pit and the heelstone at stonehenge , it ran directly along the final section of the avenue , on the path of the sunrise on the summer solstice .     \u201cwe thought , that \u2019 s a bit of a coincidence ! \u201d gaffney recalled . \u201cthat was the point at which we thought , what \u2019 s at the other end ? and there \u2019 s another pit ! two pits , marking the midsummer sunrise and the midsummer solstice , set within a monument that \u2019 s meant to be something to do with the passage of the sun. \u201d     with his hands passing over the map , gaffney showed how \u2014 on the longest days of the year \u2014 the pits formed a triangle with stonehenge marking sunrise and sunset .     \u201cnobody had ever seen these pits before , \u201d he continued . \u201cbut they link the area of stonehenge with the cursus directly . either these things have been put inside the cursus to mark these points , or the cursus has been wrapped around them. \u201d     what was so interesting about the cursus pits was that they told a story about the landscape . the \u201csunrise \u201d pit was visible from stonehenge , but the \u201csunset \u201d pit was not \u2014 it was nestled behind a ridge , and could have been seen only if there had been fire and smoke coming from it . ( at some point the pits will have to be excavated for evidence of such activity. ) these discoveries fed into a larger understanding of stonehenge as \u201cdiachronic \u201d \u2014 operating in light and dark , sunrise and sunset , day and night .     \u201cthe point i think we \u2019 re coming to , \u201d said gaffney , \u201cis that increasingly we can see the area around stonehenge as providing extensive evidence for complex liturgical movement \u2014 which we can now understand , largely because we know where things are. \u201d     parker pearson , for his part , takes a cautious view of the new research . \u201cuntil you dig holes , you just don \u2019 t know what you \u2019 ve got , \u201d he told me in his office at university college london . \u201cwhat date it is , how significant it is . [ there are ] extraordinary new features coming up , and we \u2019 re thinking well , what are they ? \u201d     to be sure , he said the data from the hidden landscapes project \u201cbacks up the pattern we \u2019 ve already been seeing for some years . we have an excessive number of solstice-aligned monuments in that landscape . nowhere in the rest of europe comes even close. \u201d he added , \u201cthis is fantastic stuff that \u2019 s been done , and it \u2019 s raised a whole series of new questions , \u201d he said . \u201cit \u2019 s going to take years. \u201d     ***     the clouds shifted in front of the sun , dappling the landscape with shadow . gaffney and i were walking the avenue , 300 yards or so from stonehenge , and in the distance a string of barrows gleamed like opals . although he acknowledged the fallibility of all archaeological projection ( \u201cin the end , \u201d he said , \u201cwe are all wrong \u201d ) , his work has led him to a new interpretation of how stonehenge was used .     gaffney \u2019 s idea was not to focus on stonehenge itself , but on \u201cprocessionality \u201d within the whole landscape . he imagined people moving around the area like roman catholics processing through the stations of the cross . he recalled an easter friday ritual he saw in croatia , in which a \u201cbloke with a cross \u201d led fellow barefoot celebrants on a miles-long trip . in gaffney \u2019 s view , the building of the great stone circle was a \u201cmonumentalizing \u201d of a similar , if heathen , procession .     as we walked downhill through the fields , gaffney stopped from time to time to point out the hillocks in which \u201cthe illustrious dead \u201d were buried . he also noted how the avenue was not a straight line between the avon and stonehenge , but rather a series of tacks that brought the visitor to the stonehenge site in a \u201ctheatrical \u201d way , along the line of sunrise on the summer solstice .     he thrust himself into the mind of a bronze age visitor to the site . \u201cyou will have seen nothing like it , \u201d he said . \u201cit would have been massively impressive. \u201d soon we descended into a valley called stonehenge bottom , only a hundred yards or so from the great stones . \u201cthey \u2019 re disappearing .... watch , just watch ! \u201d he said .     within a few yards , the monument became invisible . when you picture stonehenge in your mind \u2019 s eye , you imagine the concentric rings of vast stones standing in a desolate open landscape , visible for miles around . but now , here we were , a hundred yards away , and the thing had gone .     we stood in a field , watched by some lethargic cows , and savored the strangeness of the moment . then , as we stepped uphill , stonehenge re-emerged on the horizon . it happened fast . the lintels , then the great sarsens , then the smaller bluestones were suddenly before us .     gaffney \u2019 s voice lifted . he spoke about jerusalem syndrome : the feeling of intense emotion experienced by pilgrims on their first sighting of the holy city . in the prehistoric world , there was no conception of god as he was understood by the later abrahamic faiths . but , said gaffney , as stonehenge reappeared before us , \u201cwhatever the ancient version of jerusalem syndrome is , that \u2019 s what you \u2019 re feeling now. \u201d\n"}, {"url": "file://val/10/2/2", "title": "val/10/2/2", "content": "angelika graswald , second from left , stands in court with michael archer , left , a forensic scientist , as her attorneys jeffrey chartier and richard portale , right , ask for bail and to unseal the indictment ... ( associated press )     goshen , n.y. ( ap ) \u2014 a woman accused of killing her fiance while out paddling on the hudson river admitted tampering with his kayak and later confessed \" it felt good knowing he would die , \" a prosecutor said wednesday .     angelika graswald , 35 , has been indicted on a second-degree murder charge in the death of vincent viafore in choppy , chilly water on the evening of april 19. police say he died 50 miles north of new york city near bannerman island , a scenic ruin near the east shore where the longtime u.s. resident from latvia volunteered as a gardener .     viafore , 46 , was not wearing a life jacket and his body hasn ' t been found .     assistant district attorney julie mohl said at a bail hearing wednesday that graswald felt trapped and stood to benefit by $ 250,000 from life insurance policies . mohl did not detail how graswald tampered with her fiance ' s kayak but said it filled with water and capsized . viafore held onto his boat for 5 to 10 minutes , but graswald called 911 some 20 minutes after his kayak capsized . witnesses say she intentionally capsized her own kayak , mohl said .     \" she felt trapped and it was her only way out , \" mohl said .     graswald was rescued by another boater and treated for hypothermia .     she later told investigators that she felt relief and \" it felt good knowing he would die , \" mohl said .     the judge set bail for graswald , who appeared in court in shackles and an orange jumpsuit , at $ 3 million cash .     after the hearing , defense attorney richard portale noted the language barrier between graswald and investigators . he said he would look into whether her statements were voluntary .     \" i ' m skeptical of the statements , \" he said .     since her arrest almost two weeks ago , those who know graswald have been trying to square the fun-loving woman they knew with the killer described by authorities .     \" the bubbly , bouncy little ballerina girl had a dark side , \" said mike colvin , a disc jockey in poughkeepsie she lived with from november 2008 to june 2010. still , he never saw graswald act in a way that suggested violence .     graswald could walk into a room full of strangers and know everyone ' s name by the time she left , colvin said . but he said he also had authority issues and could make unwise snap decisions when angry . she had run through two marriages and a string of jobs by her mid-30s . the impulsiveness apparently contributed to her checkered job history at restaurants and other businesses .     \" they would have staff meetings , and she would just lose it , and eventually she ' d have to be let go , \" colvin said . \" this happened more than once . not a big fan of authority . \"     graswald and viafore appeared to be a happy couple .     images posted online show an active , affectionate pair spending time outdoors , particularly on the water , and a message about their plans to be married at a spot on the baltic sea . sean von clauss , a professional musician from boston who had known viafore since boyhood , recalls how the couple would affectionately slow dance when he performed \" shama lama ding dong . \"     \" they were always in love \u2014 singing , dancing and holding . they were always together , \" von clauss said . \" he was thrilled that he found his soul mate . \"     viafore had a booming laugh and loved to socialize \u2014 the kind of guy who would pick up the check , von clauss said .     von clauss said he saw graswald the friday before her arrest at a gathering to remember viafore at a bar . she brought a poster board covered with pictures and asked von clauss to play \" shama lama ding dong . \" usually they would play \" hotel california \" together , but she asked him to play solo that night . then she forgot the words .     \" we all kind of sang along , then she sort of finished it by herself , \" he said . \" we all gave her a big round of applause anyway . \"     ___
