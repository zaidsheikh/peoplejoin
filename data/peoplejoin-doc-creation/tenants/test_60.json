( associated press )     washington ( ap ) \u2014 seeking to avert a government shutdown , republican leaders drove a bill blocking planned parenthood ' s federal funds through the house on friday , hoping to contain conservatives ' demands for a politically risky showdown with president barack obama by striking a quick blow against abortion .     the nearly party-line 241-187 vote followed a no-holds-barred debate that included a graphic , poster-sized photo of a scarred , aborted fetus and underscored how abortion has resurfaced as a white-hot political issue . the battle has been rejoined just in time for the 2016 election campaign and next week ' s historic address to congress by pope francis .     the issue ' s re-emergence followed the release of secretly recorded videos of planned parenthood officials offhandedly discussing how they sometimes procure tissue from aborted fetuses for medical research .     \" what does it say about this congress that today we ' re here on the house floor debating the killing and harvesting of aborted babies ? \" said rep. marlin stutzman , r-ind . \" how can there possibly be two sides to this ? \"     but democrats said the true gop goal was to whip up conservative voters with legislation that would make it harder for women to get health care . planned parenthood , whose clinics provide sexual disease tests , contraception and abortion , says it ' s done nothing illegal and is being victimized by misleadingly edited videos .     \" enough is enough , \" said rep. debbie wasserman schultz , d-fla. , who chairs the democratic national committee . \" some of their members are willing to risk women ' s lives just to score political points . \"     planned parenthood gets around $ 450 million yearly in federal payments , mostly medicaid reimbursements for handling low-income patients . that ' s around one-third of the organization ' s $ 1.3 billion annual budget . practically none of the federal money can be used for abortions .     beyond friday ' s bill , some conservatives want to attach language halting planned parenthood ' s payments to broader legislation financing government agencies , which otherwise run out of money next thursday . those republicans say a government shutdown fight would at least produce a veto battle that would show voters where republicans stand .     house speaker john boehner , r-ohio , a long-time abortion foe , and virtually all house republicans favor halting the flow of federal dollars to planned parenthood . but boehner and other gop leaders say a shutdown battle would be fruitless because they lack enough votes to prevail in the senate or overcome an obama veto . they also say voters oppose a shutdown and would punish the gop in next year ' s elections if one occurred .     long unhappy with boehner and other gop leaders for not being confrontational enough , some in his party have threatened to force a house vote on removing him from his post if he backs down on this or other upcoming fights over federal borrowing and spending .     the legislation that was voted on friday , proposed by rep. diane black , r-tenn. , would end federal payments to planned parenthood for a year , diverting the money to thousands of community health centers . republicans say those clinics could handle the displaced planned parenthood patients , but democrats say the centers are overburdened and sometimes distant .     pressure from conservatives may ultimately force leaders to let congress vote anyway on a bill that would avert a shutdown only if planned parenthood ' s federal dollars were stopped , a measure certain to die in the senate . once defeated , that would likely be followed by a measure temporarily financing government , perhaps into december , that would include planned parenthood funds and buy time to resolve disputes over spending , abortion and other issues .     for now , republican leaders are hoping that investigations by four congressional committees and other anti-abortion bills will relieve some of the pressure .     along those lines , the house voted 248-177 friday for another measure , this one by rep. trent franks , r-ariz. , that would impose penalties of up to five years in prison plus fines on doctors who don ' t try to save infants born alive during abortions .     and the senate set a vote for tuesday on a measure banning most late-term abortions , a bill that democrats were poised to scuttle . both of those bills also would face likely senate defeat and an obama veto threat .     in friday ' s house debate , both sides showed they had plenty of steam on the issue .     franks , who brought the fetus poster to the floor , said congress ' response to the planned parenthood videos \" is vital to everything those lying out in arlington cemetery died to save . \"     and house majority leader kevin mccarthy , r-calif. , asked , \" in the face of these videos , with all the alternatives women have for health , why would you want to force your constituents to pay for something so evil ? \"     firing back , rep. jan schakowsky , d-ill. , said republicans ' were relying on deceptively edited videos and had \" manufactured a witch hunt . \" added rep. sam farr , d-calif. , \" stop being so mean . solve problems , do not create them . \"\n"}, {"url": "file://test/60/1/0", "title":

than two weeks with still no concrete plan to stop it .     it \u2019 s not that speaker john boehner \u2019 s ( r-ohio ) leadership team is hiding their best hand . they have no trick up their sleeve , no ace in the hole \u2014 pick your clich\u00e9 . nearly everyone in house and senate leadership recognizes a simple reality : at some point in the next two weeks , they will move on a bill free of provisions to strip planned parenthood of its government funding . it just depends how long it takes , how painful it is and whether boehner and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell \u2019 s ( r-ky. ) team stumbles into their second government shutdown in three years .     story continued below     twelve days remain until the government runs out of money , but the house and senate are scheduled to be in session for just a fraction of that time . the showdown over planned parenthood is the epitome of crisis-fueled legislating . senior republican lawmakers and aides increasingly believe that the funding fight will come down to three-day dash \u2013 sept. 28 through sept. 30 , the final day of the fiscal year .     asked wednesday when his colleagues would get a glimpse at his bill to fund the government , boehner said , \u201cat some point. \u201d     several house republicans lawmakers said they don ' t expect to vote before the week of sept. 30. the house is only scheduled to be in session three days that week before the government runs out of money .     to top it off , the endgame will almost certainly result in a referendum on boehner \u2019 s speakership . he ' s favored , but not guaranteed , to survive . but if he does it will be in a further weakened state .     the path the funding fight will take is not yet clear to either boehner or mcconnell , according to senior aides to both men . but it \u2019 s shaping up to be extraordinarily messy .     top aides to mcconnell and boehner have been in close contact , discussing who will move first to pass a funding bill in their chamber . but the house has been paralyzed with indecision . a pack of house republicans \u2013 mostly on steve scalise \u2019 s ( r-la. ) whip team \u2013 are worried about the expectations that will be set by passing a funding bill that strips funding from planned parenthood , only to relent in the end . yet other forces in the conference want a vote on such a continuing resolution \u2013 and it \u2019 s possible , yet hardly certain , that gop leadership will set one up for next week .     house republicans want to be first to move a funding bill , but mcconnell is setting up his own process \u2013 a sign of how slow the house has been to take action .     mcconnell is nearly certain to bring up a so-called cr to fund the government next week that includes the language to defund planned parenthood , but democrats will block its consideration . mcconnell will then move a funding bill free of legislative riders . republican leaders believe conservatives , like sen. ted cruz ( r-texas ) will block it , but mcconnell will be able to send it to the house by sept. 29 at the latest . the senate ' s plan could be put on hold if the house gets its act togther , aides caution .     the house is also trying to send other anti-abortion measures to obama \u2019 s desk and are considering standalone bills , including one to defund planned parenthood that would ride alongside the government funding bill , but not impede its passage in the senate . if the house hasn \u2019 t passed a \" clean \" bill by sept. 29 , it will have one day to avoid a government shutdown by passing the senate \u2019 s bill , or a comparable measure .     \u201cat some point in time you have to face reality , \u201d said rep. mike simpson ( r-idaho ) , a member of the appropriations committee who is close to boehner , speaking about the need to pass a clean bill . \u201cpeople say , \u2018oh , you didn ' t even try to do x. \u2019 there are some things you can ' t do . we tried to repeal obamacare 50-some odd times in the house and guess what ? it didn ' t work . we probably should have figured that out after two or three. \u201d     house republican leaders , meanwhile , are working behind the scenes to try to calm the troops . mccarthy and scalise have privately told republicans that they will try to use the majority-vote reconciliation process to deny funding to the women \u2019 s health group \u2014 they say that is the best way to get a bill to president barack obama ' s desk . gop leaders have urged anti-abortion groups to speak out against a shutdown .     at a closed party-wide meeting at the capitol hill club on thursday morning , gop leaders presented lawmakers with an internal national republican congressional committee poll showing overwhelming public opposition to shutting down the government to stop funding planned parenthood . the poll , conducted in 18 swing districts by the gop firm the tarrance group , showed 64 percent of respondents would not favor a shutdown to try to stop the organization \u2019 s federal funding , compared to 30 percent who favor shutting the government . among those who had seen videos allegedly showing planned parenthood officials discussing fetal tissue sales , 55 percent did not favor a shutdown , while 37 percent thought it was the right move .     \u201cwe want to be more strategic because i think we are on more solid ground right now than we have before in raising these issues , \u201d rep. john shimkus said ( r-ill. ) , who has a long record opposing abortion rights . \u201cbut there are some that say , ' not a penny . ' so , leadership is trying to work it out. \u201d     while much of this fight is about the government \u2019 s purported support of abortion , there \u2019 s a hefty anti-boehner sentiment that \u2019 s spurring the opposition to the leadership \u2019 s plans . after congress clears a clean government-funding bill , boehner and mccarthy aides expect a hard-line conservative to put forward a motion that would , if successful , force the ohio republican from the speaker \u2019 s chair .     republican leaders do not expect the so-called motion to vacate , first filed by north carolina rep. mark meadows , to succeed . they say they would handily defeat it if it came to the floor . \" team boehner , \" as it is called internally , is not actively preparing for the vote by whipping support in the gop conference .     but some of his allies privately say they have informally secured assurances from democrats that they would support keeping boehner as speaker , or vote present , which would lower the vote threshold . if all democrats voted present , boehner could win with as few as 124 republicans . recently , boehner has even told some republicans privately he would like to run for another term as speaker .     those looking to oust boehner have not put forward an alternative to serve as speaker , and senior gop leadership aides say the hardliners have no alternative for when the senate and president reject their plan to defund planned parenthood . for example , rep. thomas massie ( r-ky. ) said florida rep. daniel webster could be the next speaker because he got \u201c12 times as many votes as kevin mccarthy. \u201d mccarthy did not campaign for the job earlier this year . webster garnered 12 votes total .     \u201cthe sept. 30 crisis is a crisis of our leadership ' s making , \u201d massie said . \u201cthey refuse to pass appropriations bills . even the cr is not the way the government is supposed to be run . the american public knows that . what we need to do is get back to regular order. \u201d     -- john bresnahan contributed to this report         authors :\n"}, {"url": "file://test/60/0/2", "title": "test/60/0/2", "content": "washington ( ap ) \u2014 republicans pushed bills targeting planned parenthood and curbing some abortion procedures toward house passage friday , with party leaders hoping the legislation will help mollify fractious conservatives demanding a face-off with president barack obama that could trigger a federal shutdown .     republican presidential candidate , sen. ted cruz , r-texas , speaks during the cnn republican presidential debate at the ronald reagan presidential library and museum on wednesday , sept. 16 , 2015 , in simi ...

( reuters )     this story has been updated .     the house passed two abortion-related bills friday , including one that would strip federal health-care funding from planned parenthood for one year , but it remains unclear whether the votes would appease conservatives who have threatened a government shutdown over the organization .     the votes followed months of intense focus on planned parenthood prompted by undercover videos released by an activist group claiming they show violations of federal laws prohibiting the sales of fetal tissue for profit and restricting certain abortion procedures . planned parenthood has denied any wrongdoing and claimed the videos have been unfairly manipulated as it has fought off attempts to end its federal support .     but neither bill is likely to become law as senate democrats have filibustered similar measures , and president obama has indicated he would veto both bills .     that \u2019 s why the move is unlikely to stave off growing fears of a government shutdown on oct. 1. since house conservatives know the bill to defund planned parenthood is unlikely to be enacted , they \u2019 re unlikely to back off their desire to attach it to a must-pass government spending measure to keep the government open . but again , neither senate democrats nor obama will accept such language , triggering the standoff .     nonetheless , house republicans hoped to appease conservatives with the abortion-related votes .     one bill passed friday , the born-alive abortion survivors protection act , would impose criminal penalties on medical personnel who fail to aid an infant born after an attempted abortion . the other , the defund planned parenthood act , imposes a one-year moratorium on federal funding for the group , which republicans say will allow for a thorough investigation of its practices . any funding , supporters said , would be redirected to clinics that do not offer abortions .     congress must pass a budget before sept. 30 , or it faces partially shutting down the government for the second time in two years . here ' s how we got to another potential shutdown .
