( plans range in price and levels of coverage from bronze to platinum , with silver a middle option. ) a 50-year-old in atlanta , where there are four carriers , could pay $ 320.06 for a comparable plan . federal subsidies could significantly reduce monthly premiums for people with low incomes .     counties with one carrier are mostly concentrated in the south . nearly all of the counties in mississippi and alabama , for example , are served by just one insurer , according to the times \u2019 s analysis . other states with scarce competition include maine , west virginia , north carolina and alaska .     \u201cthe consumer wants some level of choice , \u201d said alexander k. feldvebel , the deputy insurance commissioner for new hampshire , where one carrier , anthem blue cross , owned by wellpoint , now offers plans . \u201cyou don \u2019 t have that when you have a single carrier offering all the products. \u201d\n"}, {"url": "file://val/51/1/1", "title": "val/51/1/1",
