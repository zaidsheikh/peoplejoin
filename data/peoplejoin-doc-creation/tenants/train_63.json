typical slots players don ' t pause between spins like that .     on june 9 , lumiere place shared its findings with the missouri gaming commission , which in turn issued a statewide alert . several casinos soon discovered that they had been cheated the same way , though often by different men than the one who \u2019 d bilked lumiere place . in each instance , the perpetrator held a cell phone close to an aristocrat mark vi model slot machine shortly before a run of good fortune .     by examining rental-car records , missouri authorities identified the lumiere place scammer as murat bliev , a 37-year-old russian national . bliev had flown back to moscow on june 6 , but the st. petersburg \u2013 based organization he worked for , which employs dozens of operatives to manipulate slot machines around the world , quickly sent him back to the united states to join another cheating crew . the decision to redeploy bliev to the us would prove to be a rare misstep for a venture that \u2019 s quietly making millions by cracking some of the gaming industry \u2019 s most treasured algorithms .     from russia with cheats     russia has been a hotbed of slots-related malfeasance since 2009 , when the country outlawed virtually all gambling . ( vladimir putin , who was prime minister at the time , reportedly believed the move would reduce the power of georgian organized crime. ) the ban forced thousands of casinos to sell their slot machines at steep discounts to whatever customers they could find . some of those cut-rate slots wound up in the hands of counterfeiters eager to learn how to load new games onto old circuit boards . others apparently went to murat bliev \u2019 s bosses in st. petersburg , who were keen to probe the machines \u2019 source code for vulnerabilities .     by early 2011 , casinos throughout central and eastern europe were logging incidents in which slots made by the austrian company novomatic paid out improbably large sums . novomatic \u2019 s engineers could find no evidence that the machines in question had been tampered with , leading them to theorize that the cheaters had figured out how to predict the slots \u2019 behavior . \u201cthrough targeted and prolonged observation of the individual game sequences as well as possibly recording individual games , it might be possible to allegedly identify a kind of \u2018pattern \u2019 in the game results , \u201d the company admitted in a february 2011 notice to its customers .     recognizing those patterns would require remarkable effort . slot machine outcomes are controlled by programs called pseudorandom number generators that produce baffling results by design . government regulators , such as the missouri gaming commission , vet the integrity of each algorithm before casinos can deploy it .     but as the \u201cpseudo \u201d in the name suggests , the numbers aren ' t truly random . because human beings create them using coded instructions , prngs can ' t help but be a bit deterministic . ( a true random number generator must be rooted in a phenomenon that is not manmade , such as radioactive decay. ) prngs take an initial number , known as a seed , and then mash it together with various hidden and shifting inputs \u2014 the time from a machine \u2019 s internal clock , for example \u2014 in order to produce a result that appears impossible to forecast . but if hackers can identify the various ingredients in that mathematical stew , they can potentially predict a prng \u2019 s output . that process of reverse engineering becomes much easier , of course , when a hacker has physical access to a slot machine \u2019 s innards .     knowing the secret arithmetic that a slot machine uses to create pseudorandom results isn \u2019 t enough to help hackers , though . that \u2019 s because the inputs for a prng vary depending on the temporal state of each machine . the seeds are different at different times , for example , as is the data culled from the internal clocks . so even if they understand how a machine \u2019 s prng functions , hackers would also have to analyze the machine \u2019 s gameplay to discern its pattern . that requires both time and substantial computing power , and pounding away on one \u2019 s laptop in front of a pelican pete is a good way to attract the attention of casino security .     the lumiere place scam showed how murat bliev and his cohorts got around that challenge . after hearing what had happened in missouri , a casino security expert named darrin hoke , who was then director of surveillance at l \u2019 auberge du lac casino resort in lake charles , louisiana , took it upon himself to investigate the scope of the hacking operation . by interviewing colleagues who had reported suspicious slot machine activity and by examining their surveillance photos , he was able to identify 25 alleged operatives who ' d worked in casinos from california to romania to macau . hoke also used hotel registration records to discover that two of bliev \u2019 s accomplices from st. louis had remained in the us and traveled west to the pechanga resort &amp; casino in temecula , california . on july 14 , 2014 , agents from the california department of justice detained one of those operatives at pechanga and confiscated four of his cell phones , as well as $ 6,000 . ( the man , a russian national , was not indicted ; his current whereabouts are unknown. )     the cell phones from pechanga , combined with intelligence from investigations in missouri and europe , revealed key details . according to willy allison , a las vegas \u2013 based casino security consultant who has been tracking the russian scam for years , the operatives use their phones to record about two dozen spins on a game they aim to cheat . they upload that footage to a technical staff in st. petersburg , who analyze the video and calculate the machine \u2019 s pattern based on what they know about the model \u2019 s pseudorandom number generator . finally , the st. petersburg team transmits a list of timing markers to a custom app on the operative \u2019 s phone ; those markers cause the handset to vibrate roughly 0.25 seconds before the operative should press the spin button .     \u201cthe normal reaction time for a human is about a quarter of a second , which is why they do that , \u201d says allison , who is also the founder of the annual world game protection conference . the timed spins are not always successful , but they result in far more payouts than a machine normally awards : individual scammers typically win more than $ 10,000 per day . ( allison notes that those operatives try to keep their winnings on each machine to less than $ 1,000 , to avoid arousing suspicion. ) a four-person team working multiple casinos can earn upwards of $ 250,000 in a single week .     repeat business     since there are no slot machines to swindle in his native country , murat bliev didn \u2019 t linger long in russia after his return from st. louis . he made two more trips to the us in 2014 , the second of which began on december 3. he went straight from chicago o ' hare airport to st. charles , missouri , where he met up with three other men who \u2019 d been trained to scam aristocrat \u2019 s mark vi model slot machines : ivan gudalov , igor larenov , and yevgeniy nazarov . the quartet planned to spend the next several days hitting various casinos in missouri and western illinois .     bliev should never have come back . on december 10 , not long after security personnel spotted bliev inside the hollywood casino in st. louis , the four scammers were arrested . because bliev and his cohorts had pulled their scam across state lines , federal authorities charged them with conspiracy to commit fraud . the indictments represented the first significant setbacks for the st. petersburg organization ; never before had any of its operatives faced prosecution .     bliev , gudalov , and larenov , all of whom are russian citizens , eventually accepted plea bargains and were each sentenced to two years in federal prison , to be followed by deportation . nazarov , a kazakh who was granted religious asylum in the us in 2013 and is a florida resident , still awaits sentencing , which indicates that he is cooperating with the authorities : in a statement to wired , aristocrat representatives noted that one of the four defendants has yet to be sentenced because he \u201ccontinues to assist the fbi with their investigations. \u201d     whatever information nazarov provides may be too outdated to be of much value . in the two years since the missouri arrests , the st. petersburg organization \u2019 s field operatives have become much cagier . some of their new tricks were revealed last year , when singaporean authorities caught and prosecuted a crew : one member , a czech named radoslav skubnik , spilled details about the organization \u2019 s financial structure ( 90 percent of all revenue goes back to st. petersburg ) as well as operational tactics . \u201cwhat they \u2019 ll do now is they \u2019 ll put the cell phone in their shirt \u2019 s chest pocket , behind a little piece of mesh , \u201d says allison . \u201cso they don \u2019 t have to hold it in their hand while they record. \u201d and darrin hoke , the security expert , says he has received reports that scammers may be streaming video back to russia via skype , so they no longer need to step away from a slot machine to upload their footage .     the missouri and singapore cases appear to be the only instances in which scammers have been prosecuted , though a few have also been caught and banned by individual casinos . at the same time , the st. petersburg organization has sent its operatives farther and farther afield . in recent months , for example , at least three casinos in peru have reported being cheated by russian gamblers who played aging novomatic coolfire slot machines .     the economic realities of the gaming industry seem to guarantee that the st. petersburg organization will continue to flourish . the machines have no easy technical fix . as hoke notes , aristocrat , novomatic , and any other manufacturers whose prngs have been cracked \u201cwould have to pull all the machines out of service and put something else in , and they \u2019 re not going to do that. \u201d ( in aristocrat \u2019 s statement to wired , the company stressed that it has been unable \u201cto identify defects in the targeted games \u201d and that its machines \u201care built to and approved against rigid regulatory technical standards. \u201d ) at the same time , most casinos can \u2019 t afford to invest in the newest slot machines , whose prngs use encryption to protect mathematical secrets ; as long as older , compromised machines are still popular with customers , the smart financial move for casinos is to keep using them and accept the occasional loss to scammers .     so the onus will be on casino security personnel to keep an eye peeled for the scam \u2019 s small tells . a finger that lingers too long above a spin button may be a guard \u2019 s only clue that hackers in st. petersburg are about to make another score .\n"}], "eden": [{"url": "file://train/63/0/2", "title": "train/63/0/2", "content": "republicans may pride themselves on upholding family values , but their new tax law could soon lead to a surge in married couples calling it quits .     lawyers are counseling couples considering divorce to do it this year \u2014 before a 76-year-old deduction for alimony payments is wiped out in 2019 under the tax cuts and jobs act .     story continued below     \u201cnow \u2019 s not the time to wait , \u201d said mary vidas , a lawyer in philadelphia and former chair of the american bar association \u2019 s section on family law . \u201cif you \u2019 re going to get a divorce , get it now. \u201d     potential divorcees have all of 2018 to use the alimony deduction as a bargaining chip in their negotiations with estranged spouses .     the deduction substantially reduces the cost of alimony payments \u2014 for people in the highest income-tax bracket , it means every dollar they pay to support a former spouse really costs them a little more than 60 cents .     the change is an example of how the tax law is having far-reaching consequences beyond its corporate and individual tax cuts , in some cases by quietly overturning decades of tax policy .     morning tax sign up for our tax policy newsletter and stay informed \u2014 weekday mornings , in your inbox . email sign up by signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from politico . you can unsubscribe at any time .     many divorce lawyers criticize republicans \u2019 decision to end the break , saying it will make divorces more acrimonious . people won \u2019 t be willing to pay as much , they say , which will disproportionately hurt women who tend to earn less and are more likely to be on the receiving end of alimony payments . ( child support payments are not deductible. )     \u201cthe repeal reduces the bargaining power of vulnerable spouses , mostly women , in achieving financial stability after a divorce , \u201d said brian vertz , a family law attorney in pittsburgh .     projected to raise $ 6.9 billion over the next decade , the repeal is one of the ways republicans defrayed the cost of their tax rewrite .     a spokesman for house ways and means chairman kevin brady ( r-texas ) said , \u201cthis is one of the many provisions of the law that removes special rules applicable only in certain circumstances in order to help simplify the code and reduce tax rates for all americans. \u201d     the break has also long been criticized as a burden on the irs because , if the alimony amounts ex-spouses report paying and receiving don \u2019 t match , it can force the agency to audit two people who may already be feuding . in 2010 , there was a $ 2.3 billion gap between the reporting , according to the treasury department \u2019 s inspector general for tax administration .     alimony has been deductible since world war ii . added to the code in 1942 , lawmakers have long believed it was unfair to tax people on the alimony they paid when the money was not available for them to spend .     the deduction is a big deal to splitting couples because if someone who earns , say , $ 250,000 \u2014 which puts them in the 24 percent income tax bracket under the new law \u2014 agrees to pay $ 4,000 per month , it really costs the person about $ 3,000 after taking the deduction into account .     without the break , many people will agree to pay only what would have been their after-tax amount \u2014 in this case , about $ 3,000 .     more couples will end up fighting in court because they won \u2019 t be able to agree on alimony terms , predicts madeline marzano-lesnevich , head of the american academy of matrimonial lawyers .     \u201cit helps settle cases , \u201d she said . \u201cwithout this , we will have husbands saying , ' i ' m not paying you that much .
