car traveling 37 mph in a 25-mph zone , the officer pulled over the hyundai , which now showed a rear texas license plate .     vandewege told the officer that he didn \u2019 t realize he was speeding

tweet-inspired story last week . ( trump had a point. ) but for this fact-check , we wondered whether amazon is causing the postal service to \" lose a fortune . \"     the post office is losing a fortune , but trump is wrong to blame amazon .     parcels are growing the postal service     the postal service reported a net loss of $ 2.7 billion for 2017. it has lost $ 65.1 billion since 2007. much of the red ink is attributed to a 2006 law mandating that usps pre-fund future retirees \u2019 health benefits .     first-class mail , the usps \u2019 biggest source of revenue , also continued to shrink , seeing a $ 1.87 billion revenue loss in fiscal year 2017.     package delivery , however , was one of the few bright spots in its latest financial statement . in 2017 , parcels brought in $ 19.5 billion , or 28 percent of usps \u2019 annual revenue . at $ 2.1 billion , packages contributed the largest revenue increase .     deals with private shippers like amazon accounted for $ 7 billion of the $ 19.5 billion in revenue . while we know that amazon is the biggest e-commerce player , we don \u2019 t know exactly how much of the $ 7 billion comes from amazon , because the details of the postal service \u2019 s deals with private shippers are considered proprietary and not made public .     a good deal ?     usps ships about 40 percent of amazon \u2019 s packages . amazon bulk-delivers packages to a usps distribution center , and the postal service brings it to your door . usps negotiates the discounted rate for that service with amazon , as it does all other bulk shippers .     those rates are kept under wraps . that said , we do know the amazon deal is at least a break-even venture .     that \u2019 s because the 2006 postal accountability and enhancement act made it illegal for usps to price parcel delivery below its cost .     \" by law our competitive package products , including those that we deliver for amazon , must cover their costs , \" an august 2017 usps press release said . \" our regulator , the postal regulatory commission ( prc ) , looks carefully at this question every year and has determined that they do . the prc has also noted that competitive products help fund the infrastructure of the postal service . \"     in fact , the postal regulatory commission gave the green light to the usps-amazon deal the same day trump began tweeting about amazon last week .     trump might have a point , however , in saying the usps could be making more money off amazon . for example , citigroup found that on average , usps was charging $ 1.46 below market rates for parcel delivery ( not just to amazon ) .     jim sauber , chief of staff for the national association of letter carriers , explained the postal service can offer lower prices than their private competitors because they already \" go to every house , every day . \"     \" we \u2019 re already going there to deliver mail and bills and advertising , so the marginal cost of delivering an extra package is not high , especially in the low-density areas , \" sauber said .     our ruling     trump tweeted , \" only fools , or worse , are saying that our money losing post office makes money with amazon . they lose a fortune , and this will be changed . \"     amazon isn \u2019 t causing the united states postal service to lose a fortune . in fact , it \u2019 s contributing to its biggest growth sector , package delivery . deals like the one with amazon brought in $ 7 billion in fiscal year 2017.     while we don \u2019 t know the deal usps crafted with amazon , we know it \u2019 s not losing money . a 2006 law codified profitability into law , and an independent regulatory commission that reviews their deals annually gave it a green light on march 29.     that said , it \u2019 s possible that the postal service could be charging amazon more for package delivery and therefore get a better deal . that still doesn \u2019 t mean usps is losing a fortune .     we rate this claim false .\n"}, {"url": "file://val/40/1/0", "title": "val/40/1/0", "content": "starbucks corp. is taking its evolution fresh juice nationwide and stocking a new line of snack bars called evolution harvest through a partnership with retailer whole foods market inc.     by the end of the year , starbucks said tuesday , it expects evolution fresh to be in about 8,000 u.s. cafes and grocery stores .     starbucks has been working to ...\n"}, {"url": "file://val/40/2/1", "title": "val/40/2/1", "content": "add this tweet to your website by copying the code below . learn more     add this video to your website by copying the code below . learn more     n\u00edorbh fh\u00e9idir an freastala\u00ed a theagmh\u00e1il . an dtriailfidh t\u00fa ar\u00eds \u00e9 ?
