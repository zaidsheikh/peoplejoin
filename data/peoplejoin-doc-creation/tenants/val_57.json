( associated press )     waco police sgt . w. patrick swanton said an uninvited group appeared for sunday ' s meeting of a loose confederation of biker gangs at a restaurant .     one man was injured when a vehicle rolled over his foot . that caused a dispute that continued inside the restaurant , where fighting and then shooting began , before the melee spilled back outside , swanton said .     authorities offered few details . it was not clear which gang was responsible for running over the biker ' s foot or which gang the aggrieved biker belonged to .     when the shootout was over , nine people were dead and 18 wounded .     police have said five biker gangs from across texas had gathered in part to settle differences over turf .     jimmy graves , who described himself as an ambassador for the gang known as the bandidos , disputed that claim , saying the groups had planned to discuss laws protecting motorcycle riders and other topics such as trademarks for club logos .     but he acknowledged that differences with other groups , such as the cossacks , have been \" simmering and brewing . \"     another biker named johnny snyder said he was at the restaurant for a quarterly meeting to talk about legislative issues .     snyder , a long-haul trucker , declined to describe what he saw inside the restaurant , saying he was only concerned with \" not getting shot . \"     he is vice president of the boozefighters motorcycle club in waco , a group that snyder says hosts charity events and family gatherings and is not a criminal gang .     about 50 weapons were confiscated , mostly knives and firearms , and swanton said more than 100 weapons may be found once authorities are done analyzing the crime scene at the twin peaks restaurant , which is part of a national chain that features waitresses in revealing uniforms .     preliminary autopsy results showed all nine of the dead were killed by gunshots . many were hit in the head , neck , chest or torso . most of the men were in their 40s , but they ranged in age from 27 to 65 , according to reports released by a mclennan county justice of the peace .     police have acknowledged firing on armed bikers , but it was unclear how many of the dead were shot by gang members and how many were shot by officers .     of the injured , seven remain hospitalized . swanton , who has been virtually the sole source of law enforcement information on the fight , described their conditions as stable .     he said the investigation is being hampered by witnesses who \" are not being honest with us . \"     police are concerned that the brawl will invite retaliation and more violence , swanton said .     \" we would encourage them to try to be a little peaceful and let the bloodshed stop , \" he said .     about 170 bikers have been charged with engaging in organized crime . swanton said more arrests are likely .     katie rhoten , whose husband , theron rhoten , was taken into custody , said he told her by phone from jail that he and two other members of a motorcycle club called vise grip had just pulled up to the restaurant .     \" they got off their bikes , and bullets were ricocheting all around them , so they ducked and ran for cover , \" she said in an interview .     when her husband , a mechanic from austin , and the others went back to retrieve their motorcycles , they were detained by police .     \" they were told they were being held for questioning and released , and they sat in the parking lot for three , four , five hours . \"     then , she said , police \" changed their mind and arrested everybody on the scene . \"     officers took into custody all sorts of \" nonviolent , noncriminal people . i mean , they got the bikers for christ guys in there . \"     in a memo dated may 1 , the texas department of public safety cautioned about increasing violence between the bandidos and the cossacks , dallas tv station wfaa reported monday .     the department ' s joint information center bulletin said the tension could stem from cossacks refusing to pay bandidos dues for operating in texas and for wearing a patch on their vest that claimed texas as their turf without the bandidos ' approval .     \" traditionally , the bandidos have been the dominant motorcycle club in texas , and no other club is allowed to wear the texas bar without their consent , \" the bulletin said , according to wfaa .     the bulletin said the fbi had received information that the bandidos had discussed \" going to war with cossacks . \" it also outlined several recent incidents between the two groups , including one instance in march when about 10 cossacks forced a bandido to pull over along interstate 35 near waco and attacked him with \" chains , batons and metal pipes before stealing his motorcycle , \" wfaa reported .     that same day , a group of bandidos confronted a cossack member fueling up at a truck stop in palo pinto county , west of fort worth , the bulletin said . when the cossack member refused to remove the texas patch from his vest , the bandidos hit him in the head with a hammer and stole it .     the department of public safety declined to release the bulletin to the associated press .     there are other documented instances of violence between the groups .     last march , two members of the bandidos were indicted in connection with the stabbing of two cossacks at an abilene steakhouse .     and in december , three bandidos were arrested for a shooting at a fort worth motorcycle bar that left one dead and two others wounded . fort worth police said the victims were known members of a criminal motorcycle gang .     the bandidos \" constitute a growing criminal threat , \" the justice department said in a report on outlaw motorcycle gangs . the report said the bandidos are involved in transporting and distributing cocaine and marijuana and in the production and distribution of methamphetamine .     ___     associated
