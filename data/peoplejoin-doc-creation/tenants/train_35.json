olivia arevalo , an 81-year-old shaman of the shipibo-conibo tribe , was shot to death near her home in the region of ucayali on thursday , prompting outrage from villagers who blamed sebastian woodroffe , a native of vancouver island .     prosecutors had initially been pursuing several potential leads into who killed arevalo .     but their main hypotheses now is that woodroffe murdered arevalo because he was upset that her son had not repaid him 14,000 soles ( $ 4,335 ) , said ricardo jimenez , the head of a regional group of prosecutors .     authorities found a document showing that woodroffe bought a gun on april 3 from a police officer , jimenez said , adding that the police officer is now being sought for questioning .     a witness also testified that a silver-colored pistol fell from a backpack that woodroffe was carrying as villagers grabbed him before the lynching , jimenez said .     \u201cwe want to see if that weapon actually existed . we haven \u2019 t found it yet but we \u2019 re looking , \u201d jimenez said . \u201cwith the new evidence that has appeared , he is the main suspect. \u201d     neither woodroffe \u2019 s nor arevalo \u2019 s family could be reached for comment .     police officers carry the body of sebastian woodroffe , a 41-year-old canadian citizen , who was beaten and strangled with a rope in the jungle region of ucayali on friday after members of an indigenous community accused him of killing a revered medicine woman , in pucallpa , peru april 21 , 2018. reuters/ hugo enrique alejos     arevalo was considered a wealth of knowledge about amazonian plants and native traditions .     yarrow willard , a friend of woodroffe \u2019 s in canada , said woodroffe was not violent and had never used a gun . \u201che was a loving father and kind man who was not capable of the crimes he was accused of , \u201d willard said in an email .     willard said woodroffe had gone to peru \u201cseeking healing as he was feeling troubled and slightly lost. \u201d     the case has spotlighted surging tourism in peru \u2019 s amazon related to the hallucinogenic plant brew ayahuasca , which has long been used by tribes in spiritual and healing rituals and is now popular among foreigners seeking vivid spiritual experiences or help with addiction .     woodroffe traveled to peru to learn about ayahuasca and plant medicine so he could become an addictions counselor , according to his post on the crowdfunding website indiegogo.com .     tests of woodroffe \u2019 s remains are expected to determine if he fired a weapon or was intoxicated before dying . authorities have expedited the laboratory work and results are now expected this week , instead of in more than two weeks as initially estimated , jimenez said .     two men sought by police for allegedly lynching woodroffe appear to have fled , jimenez said .     in 2015 , a canadian killed a friend in self-defense during an ayahuasca session . in 2012 , an 18-year-old

content .     an alleged victim of former silicon valley star t.j. miller is coming forward with accusations that miller hit and sexually assaulted her while in college .     the accusations were eventually addressed by a student court at george washington university and have been buzzed about in hollywood and stand-up circles for years .     \u201che just tried a lot of things without asking me , and at no point asked me if i was all right , \u201d the woman told the daily beast . \u201che choke[ d ] me , and i kept staring at his face hoping he would see that i was afraid and [ that he ] would stop \u2026 i couldn \u2019 t say anything. \u201d     miller \u2019 s alleged victim , who asked to remain anonymous , said she is coming forward now in part because of the societal awakening to issues of sexual assault and harassment that has come in the aftermath of misconduct allegations that have rocked the entertainment industry . the daily beast is withholding her identity because of her fears of retribution . but for the purposes of this piece , we will call her sarah .     miller has told friends over the years that he was wrongfully accused . and in a statement to the daily beast , miller and his wife , kate , denied any wrongdoing . instead , they cast themselves as the victims .     sarah \u201cbegan again to circulate rumors online once [ my and kate \u2019 s ] relationship became public . sadly she is now using the current climate to bandwagon and launch these false accusations again , \u201d the millers wrote . \u201cit is unfortunate that she is choosing this route as it undermines the important movement to make women feel safe coming forward about legitimate claims against real known predators. \u201d     \u201c miller began \u2018shaking [ her ] violently \u2019 and punched her in the mouth during sex . \u201d     but it \u2019 s not just sarah who has come forward . the daily beast has corroborated details of her story \u2014 which includes two separate incidents \u2014 with five gw contemporaries and spoke to numerous associates of both her and miller .     two of the gw contemporaries say they were in the off-campus house where the incidents allegedly occurred . the contemporaries later testified in student court about hearing the sound of violent thuds or seeing bruises on sarah .     three other contemporaries said they comforted and counseled sarah in the aftermath of the incidents . matt lord was one of them . an ex-boyfriend of sarah \u2019 s , he told the daily beast that he continues to believe her story more than a decade after the fact .     \u201ci attended george washington university for undergraduate studies from 2000 until december 2003 ... i had a romantic relationship with [ this ] woman , who spoke with me about t.j. miller sexually assaulting her , \u201d lord , who currently works as an attorney in montague , massachusetts , wrote in a statement to the daily beast . \u201cat the time i believed the statements she made regarding the assault by mr. miller , and i continue to believe the statements she made are true . she was engaged in student conduct proceedings regarding the sexual assault , and i remember the emotional toll that the assault and the subsequent conduct hearings placed on her. \u201d     in the years since , miller has attempted to address the lingering allegations by occasionally making light of them . he \u2019 s privately joked about committing violence against a woman in his past , according to three sources in the comedy world . perhaps that is why some female performers and comedy professionals tell the daily beast that they have declined to work with miller , citing a perceived history of abusive behavior .     the incidents took place at gw where miller was a student and sarah was taking classes but not matriculating . they fell in with the same gw comedy troupe , recess , during which time they struck up a relationship . \u201ci felt relatively safe with t.j. at the time , \u201d sarah explained .     but months into their relationship , which started in the fall of 2001 , sarah said the first troubling encounter took place . she recalled having \u201ca lot to drink \u201d and admitted that there are \u201cparts of [ the incident ] i don \u2019 t remember. \u201d she stressed that \u201cit is important to me to cop to that \u2026 [ and ] i \u2019 m not interested in forcing a pretend memory on anyone \u2026 15 years later , i remain terrified of accusing someone of something they didn \u2019 t do , but i have a visual and physical memory of that. \u201d     however , sarah said she has a distinct memory that as they were \u201cfooling around \u201d at her place , miller began \u201cshaking me violently \u201d and punched her in the mouth during sex .     sarah said that she woke up the following morning with a fractured tooth and a bloodied lip . when she asked miller about it that morning , he claimed , according to sarah , that she had simply fallen down drunkenly the past evening .     she was unsettled by the incident , but said that she did not know many people in d.c. and continued to see miller . she had lost her virginity to him and , at least for a brief window , he was someone she trusted .     \u201c i couldn \u2019 t bring myself [ at the time ] to believe this had happened ... it was me not wanting it to be true . \u201d     \u201ci couldn \u2019 t bring myself [ at the time ] to believe this had happened , \u201d sarah said . \u201cit was me not wanting it to be true. \u201d

that she called miller to confide in him . she had not fully processed the first encounter , she said , and miller was still someone she believed she could turn to in a time of stress and vulnerability .     they soon met at a college party , and left in a cab to head back to the apartment she had been renting with her roommates . when they arrived back at her home , they began to engage in consensual sex \u2014 but then miller became violent again , sarah said . she emphasized that she had not had more than two drinks that evening , and that her memory of the following \u201cfive-hour \u201d ordeal was and is \u201ccrystal-clear. \u201d     \u201cwe started to fool around , and very early in that , he put his hands around my throat and closed them , and i couldn \u2019 t breathe , \u201d she recalled . \u201ci was genuinely terrified and completely surprised . i understand now that this is for some people a kink , and i continue to believe it is [ something ] that should be entered into by consenting parties . but , as someone who had only begun having sexual encounters , like , about three months earlier , i had no awareness this was a kink , and i had certainly not entered into any agreement that i would be choked .     \u201ci was fully paralyzed , \u201d sarah continued .     sarah claimed that she was \u201cchoking audibly \u201d \u2014 to the point that her roommates could hear what was happening and rushed over to knock on her bedroom door . sarah said she then got up and walked to her door in a robe , and one of her roommates asked if everything was ok.     \u201ci don \u2019 t know , \u201d she responded , before shutting the door , \u201ci \u2019 ll talk to you in the morning. \u201d     \u201che pulled me back to bed and more things happened , \u201d sarah said . \u201che anally penetrated me without my consent , which i actually believe at that point i cried out , like , \u2018no , \u2019 and he didn \u2019 t continue to do that \u2014 but he also had a [ beer ] bottle with him the entire time . he used the bottle at one point to penetrate me without my consent. \u201d     during the incident , sarah said she \u201cfroze. \u201d she says she \u201cwasn \u2019 t prepared \u201d for what had happened and that she \u201cdidn \u2019 t want to believe it was happening. \u201d     miller finally left her apartment around 5 a.m. the next morning , sarah said she confided in her roommates about what had happened . one of those housemates , who is currently a maryland resident and stay-at-home mom who asked not to be named in this story , confirmed as much to the daily beast .     \u201ci knew t.j. was in her bedroom and i was in my bedroom , which was a wall away , \u201d the source said . \u201cmy [ other ] roommate was in my bedroom with me and we heard a loud smacking noise , and we were concerned \u2026 the very next day when we talked to [ sarah ] she was very upset , and \u2026 had said he had hit her in a very violent way. \u201d     katie duffy , a former gw student and another of sarah \u2019 s ex-housemates , said she had not realized that the \u201ct.j. \u201d from that night was the famed actor and comedian until informed by the daily beast . ( she conceded she \u201chad to google him. \u201d ) but she recalled the incident much as sarah had described it .     \u201cone night , she had [ miller ] back , and late at night \u2026 [ a housemate and i ] heard quite a lot of fighting [ sounds ] and banging , and loud , violent sounds [ in the room next to us ] , \u201d duffy said . \u201cso we knocked on the door of our housemate [ sarah ] , and asked if she was ok. she did indicate she was ok. whatever response she gave , we felt we didn \u2019 t have to intervene further , at least at the time \u2026 looking back , i wish we had done more to intervene , but we didn \u2019 t know what was going on \u2026 this is a girl i didn \u2019 t know very well , but it didn \u2019 t mean i didn \u2019 t have the power to go into that room , and remove her from that situation , and protect her . we did what we thought was the right thing at the time . it wasn \u2019 t enough. \u201d     the next morning , duffy recalled , sarah came down to the small kitchen where other housemates were having coffee and breakfast . her physical appearance raised alarm .     \u201cshe looked like she had been through a rough night \u2014 i recall seeing bruises [ on sarah ] , \u201d duffy said . \u201cone roommate asked if she wanted to go to the police . others offered to take her to the hospital , given how she looked. \u201d     sarah ultimately declined . duffy moved out shortly thereafter , and said she hasn \u2019 t spoken to sarah since , simply because \u201cwe didn \u2019 t know each other well. \u201d     in the days and weeks that directly followed the alleged sexual assaults , sarah \u2019 s friendship with miller disintegrated completely . she said they met once more , days after that second night , to talk about what had happened ; \u201ct.j . said it was a \u2018trust thing \u2019 \u2026 and that he thought i was into it , \u201d sarah recalled .     as they drifted apart , she asked mutual friends of miller \u2019 s about the incident . according to sarah and those close to her , the responses were fairly uniform , to the effect of , \u201cyeah , that \u2019 s just t.j. \u201d the only other time she would see him over the next year was at a female comedy group show that she attended . \u201ct.j . showed up to heckle , and i remember being so angry , \u201d she said , \u201cand had to leave. \u201d     \u201c she looked like she had been through a rough night \u2014 i recall seeing bruises ... one roommate asked if she wanted to go to the police . others offered to take her to the hospital . \u201d     it would be almost a year \u2014 following much deliberations , counsel , and support from friends \u2014 before sarah went to gw \u2019 s campus police to tell them what had happened . by then , miller was in his last year at the university .     \u201ci was not ready to process what was happening [ the prior year ] , and i have spent a lot of time in my life apologizing for not having shouted \u2018no , \u2019 and for not having told my roommates to get him out of here , \u201d sarah said , explaining why she didn \u2019 t go to campus police a year earlier . \u201ci was not ready to reconcile the events taking place with the person i had known . it was so disorienting and so physically traumatic. \u201d     like other female college students in similar circumstances , sarah did not want to take the case to the cops since nearly a year had passed , and there was no remaining physical evidence . instead , her allegations were handled by the \u201cstudent court \u201d at the university .     at this point , sarah asked her housemate \u2014 the current maryland mom who heard the \u201cloud smacking noise \u201d \u2014 if she would testify in the student court process , and she agreed .     \u201ci testified in student court about the noise i had heard and how upset she was after the incident , \u201d sarah \u2019 s former housemate recalled to the daily beast . \u201ct.j . was there with a lawyer during the student court proceeding. \u201d     that housemate subsequently asked duffy if she \u2019 d testified . \u201ci was happy to , \u201d duffy said , recalling that she did not see sarah at the student court during her testimony , but said that miller , his father , and his attorney were there .     \u201ci was asked why i hadn \u2019 t done anything [ more ] if i was so worried \u2026 and i said , well , the noises were loud enough that it did prompt us to ask what was wrong , so we did do something , \u201d duffy said . \u201ci felt very uncomfortable , the way they were challenging me on it. \u201d     sarah said that the student court grilled her about \u201call my habits , \u201d including what she had to drink , and how much , on both nights . she was asked if she had ever heard of erotic asphyxiation , and was asked if they had ever discussed the sexual practice , which she had not .     after a trial period that lasted a couple of weeks , sarah said that the university told her that the issue had been resolved .     a gw spokesperson would only tell the daily beast that \u201cbecause of federal privacy law , we are not able to provide information about current or former students \u2019 education records , \u201d in response to inquiries regarding a campus pd report or the student court proceedings . the federal law gw is referencing is the family educational rights and privacy act ( ferpa ) .     gw did confirm , however , that miller graduated in 2003 , but did not comment on whether he \u201cgraduated early \u201d due to any unique circumstance . other knowledgeable sources told the daily beast that miller was \u201cexpelled after he graduated \u201d \u2014 an outcome that appeared to be an attempt by the university to satisfy both parties .     sarah said she had lost acquaintances over her allegations , several of whom were her former comedy-troupe cohorts , most of whom ended up supporting miller .     four of these friends spoke to the daily beast , though none agreed to do so on the record . each of these friends was in the college comedy troupe or matriculating at gw at the time . and all of them presented the same general portrait of miller as a gregarious and generous person who \u201ccouldn \u2019 t have done this , \u201d as several said .     \u201ci \u2019 ve known t.j. since college , always known him to be a very caring person , and respectful , particularly toward women , \u201d one friend said . \u201cand he loves his wife very , very much. \u201d     another source , who testified in student court ( via phone , post-graduation ) on miller \u2019 s behalf , said it was unimaginable that t.j. could do \u201canything like that. \u201d     \u201ci have never heard of another woman [ who dated him in college ] make any kind of allegation or insinuation that he was anything but a good guy , \u201d the friend continued . another friend insisted that miller \u201cwas the type of person if you took him to a strip club , he would want to talk to the strippers , not hit on them. \u201d     no one has accused miller of hitting on strippers .     a source also produced a set of email exchanges between miller and someone who dated sarah later in life . the emails , one of which was presented without the conversation that preceded it , didn \u2019 t directly address the incident itself but instead showed both parties trying to come to a more amicable understanding . sarah told the daily beast that she was simply under \u201csome social pressure to be cool about this at the time , and didn ' t necessarily see myself as having any other option to resolution. \u201d     one of miller \u2019 s friends said he \u201cbelieved [ sarah ] knew she was making this up \u201d to \u201cintentionally and maliciously fabricate \u201d a sexual-assault allegation . this friend could not offer any evidence to support such a claim , nor could another person , who wasn \u2019 t a friend of miller \u2019 s but shared a similar view and testified on his behalf .     kate and t.j. miller made similar accusations in a statement\u200d provided weeks after first learning that the daily beast was reporting on these incidents .     \u201cwe met this woman over a decade ago while studying together in college , she attempted to break us up back then by plotting for over a year before making contradictory claims and accusations , \u201d the millers wrote .     \u201cshe was asked to leave our university comedy group because of worrisome and disturbing behavior , which angered her immensely , she then became fixated on our relationship , and began telling people around campus \u2018i \u2019 m going to destroy them \u2019 and \u2018i \u2019 m going to ruin him , \u2019 \u201d the statement continued .     when asked about these claims , sarah \u2019 s responded , \u201cof course not. \u201d     \u201che was a friend to me before [ the incidents ] , and he had been there for me before that , \u201d she said . \u201ci didn \u2019 t want him in jail . i didn \u2019 t hate him . he was someone i cared about \u2026 i don \u2019 t want to mess up his life . but he behaved in a way towards me that i have to live with \u2026 [ and ] i don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s appropriate that i carry this by myself. \u201d     if sarah was eager to settle scores with miller , she certainly didn \u2019 t show it . when the daily beast first started looking into this story , those close to her said for months that she had expressed no desire to come forward and was actively avoiding media inquiries . only weeks after the advent of the #metoo movement did that seem to change .     miller soon left his alma mater and became a star in stand-up comedy . he then began appearing in major hollywood productions , and landed a starring role on the critically lauded hbo show silicon valley . but despite the lack of public accusations since his time at george washington , whispers about what happened in his college years followed him .     four female comedians and bookers who spoke to the daily beast said that they had heard of the alleged sexual misconduct at gw . some of these comics had heard about the accusations from sarah directly , and have since warned women in stand-up comedy about miller .     but some know about the sexual-assault allegations because miller talked about them himself when confiding in friends and associates .     four sources in the l.a. and chicago comedy scenes \u2014 including jc coccoli , a los angeles-based producer who briefly dated miller in 2009 \u2014 said they each first heard of the allegations because miller had told them about them or referenced them in private conversation , or at small gatherings before or after shows . miller did so in the context of vehemently denying \u201crumors \u201d circulating in various comedy communities . other times , he would crack jokes about punching a woman he knew in college , two other comics independently told the daily beast .     maura brown , a comedy festival organizer and publicist who used to work in l.a. and has since uprooted to portland , oregon , said she has also heard about the miller allegation for years .     \u201cvery commonly , women have warned each other [ in entertainment ] about him \u2026 and about what happened in college , \u201d brown told the daily beast .     brown noted that starting in 2013 , when she first heard about the allegations , she \u201cnever wanted to work with him [ ever ] , and never wanted to work on the same projects as him , \u201d and that \u201cthis convinced me to not try to book him or promote him in any way. \u201d     \u201c i didn \u2019 t want him in jail . i didn \u2019 t hate him . but he behaved in a way towards me that i have to live with \u2026 i don \u2019 t think it \u2019 s appropriate that i carry this by myself . \u201d     still , miller , whose star is increasingly rising in hollywood these days , continues to have friends in high places in the entertainment world .     miller is set to appear in several major film projects , including an upcoming movie co-starring kristen stewart and another starring ryan reynolds . this year , hbo aired his stand-up special , and comedy central started airing the gorburger show , what miller has previously told the daily beast is his \u201cpassion project \u201d about a murderous alien talk-show host .     sarah , his alleged victim , no longer lives in l.a. , where she resettled not long after auditing at gw . she says she had a \u201cwonderful experience doing improv and comedy \u201d in the local comedy scene , and tried to put what happened with miller behind her .     \u201c i had to see him at my improv school [ in l.a. ] , which i , shortly after , stopped going to , and see him at stand-up shows , and i stopped doing stand-up [ eventually in l.a. ] , \u201d sarah said . \u201cit doesn \u2019 t help that when i was living in l.a. i had to keep seeing his name on billboards , and on bus stops , and it just didn \u2019 t \u2026 stop. \u201d     she added , \u201cit is unfathomable to me that he doesn \u2019 t understand that he actually put me through something i have to live with , that i never would \u2019 ve chosen , that completely , completely set the tone for my sexual adult life , that i actively had to spend years and years \u2026 un-programming. \u201d\n"}, {"url": "file://train/35/2/1", "title": "train/35/2/1", "content":
