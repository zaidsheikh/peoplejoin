    kim : well , i think you could actually ask why has it taken so long ? yeah , merkel has really reduced her contacts with putin to a minimum . she ' s really been focused on finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict in ukraine which has largely disappeared from the headlines . her official reason for coming now to russia is to prepare for the g20 , the group of 20 major economies summit in germany in july . but , of course , the timing is really important .     the european union today is looking probably more vulnerable than it has ever . and putin is looking like the most stable leader in the region . so i think it ' s kind of a recognition that you need to talk to russia if you want to solve any problems .     greene : that is amazing to have arrived at that point where european countries feel like putin is the most stable potential ally . so that ' s really what merkel ' s trying to get from putin , some sort of promise that he ' s going to work with europe in a progressive way , in a productive way ?     kim : well , maybe not as an ally , but , i mean , he ' s not going away . he ' s been , you know , in power since 2000. the only other leader is merkel that ' s been around that long . but i think it ' s - it ' s , as i said , it was more - it ' s more of a recognition that you ' re going to have to deal with him if you ' re going to reach a resolution in ukraine or in syria . he has become the indispensable leader . and i think that ' s why merkel is also - is going and is ready to talk to him .     greene : how do russians view this meeting ? do they want putin to get closer to leaders like merkel in the west ?     kim : well , i think for russians it ' s very important or for putin it ' s very important to be seen as someone who is a major player . so by speaking to merkel , that obviously helps him . and he ' s really been on a roll . he just spoke with japanese prime minister abe last week . and tomorrow , he ' s going to meet the turkish president , recep tayyip erdogan , in sochi , as well . so i think this - the international buzz around him definitely helps him because it shows that russia is a player that the rest of the world cannot ignore .     greene : well , and speaking of that , i mean , he has - putin also has a phone call with president donald trump later today . how does that all fit into his diplomacy ?

    nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) effectively reduce inflammation ( swelling ) and relieve pain . inflammation is the body ' s way of protecting itself after irritation or an injury . signs of inflammation include redness , warmth , swelling , and pain .     nsaids are used to treat a variety of symptoms such as pain , inflammation , and stiffness caused by rheumatoid arthritis and tendonitis . nsaids are also used to treat several other conditions , such as :     osteoarthritis     muscle aches     backaches     dental pain     pain caused by gout     bursitis , and     menstrual cramps     they may also be used to reduce fever or relieve minor aches caused by the common cold .     how do nsaids work ?     nsaids work by blocking the production of certain body chemicals that cause inflammation . nsaids are effective in treating pain caused by slow , prolonged tissue damage , such as the pain from an arthritic joint . nsaids are also effective in treating general or localized pain , such as back pain , menstrual cramps , and headaches .     nsaids work like corticosteroids ( also called steroids ) , without many of the side effects of steroids . steroids are man-made drugs that are very similar to cortisone , a naturally-occurring hormone . like cortisone , nsaids are effective in reducing pain and inflammation often associated with joint and muscle diseases and injuries .     are nsaids available without a prescription ?     yes . over-the-counter nsaids are available without a prescription , in much lower doses than prescription nsaids . current over-the-counter nsaids include :     aspirin compounds ( such as anacin \u00ae , ascriptin \u00ae , bayer \u00ae , bufferin \u00ae and excedrin \u00ae )     , ascriptin , bayer , bufferin and excedrin ) ibuprofen ( such as motrin \u00ae and advil \u00ae )     and advil ) naproxen sodium ( such as aleve \u00ae )     over-the-counter nsaids are effective in treating mild osteoarthritis and some muscle injuries . ibuprofen and naproxen are also used to treat fever . as with any medication , always follow the directions on the label and the instructions from your healthcare provider .     how long should i use an over-the-counter nsaid ?     never use an over-the-counter nsaid continuously for more than three days for fever , and 10 days for pain , without talking to your healthcare provider . over-the-counter nsaids are effective pain-relievers , but they are intended for short-term use . when taking nsaids for long periods of time , you should be carefully monitored by your healthcare provider so he or she can watch for harmful side effects and change your treatment , if necessary .     how long do nsaids take to work ?     depending on the nsaid and the condition being treated , some nsaids may work within a few hours , while others may take a week or two before most benefits are achieved . generally , for acute muscle injuries , we recommend nsaids that work quickly ; however , these may need to be taken as often as every four to six hours because of their short action time .     for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis that need long-term treatment , we usually recommend nsaids that need to be taken only once or twice a day . however , it generally takes longer for these drugs to have a therapeutic ( healing ) effect .     when are nsaids prescribed ?     nsaids are often prescribed for rheumatologic diseases , including rheumatoid arthritis and moderate-to- severe osteoarthritis . nsaids are also prescribed for moderately painful musculoskeletal conditions such as back pain .     how are nsaids prescribed ?     nsaids are prescribed in different doses , depending on the condition that is being treated . these drugs may need to be taken from one to four times a day . do not increase the dose without asking your health care provider first .     your healthcare provider may prescribe higher doses of nsaids if you have rheumatoid arthritis , for example , because this disease often causes a significant degree of heat , swelling , and redness and stiffness in the joints . lower doses may be prescribed for osteoarthritis and acute muscle injuries , since there is generally less swelling and frequently no warmth or redness in the joints .     no single nsaid is guaranteed to work . your healthcare provider may prescribe several types of nsaids in order to find the one that works best for you . avoid aspirin and alcoholic beverages while taking nsaids .     what are some prescription nsaids ?     below is a list of some prescription nsaids . please note : this is not an all-inclusive list . in addition , many nsaids are only available as generic formulations .     generic name/brand name ( if still available )     celecoxib ( celebrex \u00ae )     ) diclofenac ( voltaren \u00ae [ available by brand name in topical form ] )     [ available by brand name in topical form ] ) diflunisal     etodolac     fenoprofen ( nalfon \u00ae )     ) flurbiprofen     ibuprofen     indomethacin ( indocin \u00ae [ available by brand name in liquid form ] )     [ available by brand name in liquid form ] ) ketoprofen     ketorolac tromethamine     meclofenamate sodium     mefenamic acid ( ponstel \u00ae )     ) meloxicam ( mobic \u00ae )     ) nabumetone     naproxen sodium ( anaprox \u00ae , naprosyn \u00ae )     , naprosyn ) oxaprozin ( daypro \u00ae )     ) piroxicam ( feldene \u00ae )     ) sulindac     tolmetin     salicylate     salsalate ( disalcid \u00ae )     how will my healthcare provider choose an nsaid that is right for me ?     in planning your treatment , your healthcare provider will take into account the effectiveness and the risks of drugs . your healthcare provider will work with you to develop an appropriate treatment program . the drugs that will be prescribed will match the seriousness of your condition . your healthcare provider will consider the results of your medical history , physical exam , x-rays , blood tests , and the presence of other medical conditions in creating your treatment plan .     it is important to meet with your healthcare provider regularly so he or she can watch for any harmful side effects and change your treatment , if necessary . your healthcare provider may order blood tests or other tests ( including a kidney function test ) from time to time to determine how effective your treatment is , and to look for any harmful side effects .     are there specific warnings associated with nsaid use ?     the food and drug administration added new warnings about nsaids in july 2015.     nsaids can increase the chance of heart attack or stroke . this risk may be greater if you have heart disease or risk factors ( for example , smoking , high blood pressure , high cholesterol , diabetes ) for heart disease . however , the risk may also be increased in people who do not have heart disease or those risk factors .     heart problems caused by nsaids can happen within the first weeks of use , and may happen more frequently with higher doses or with long-term use .     nsaids should not be used right before or after heart bypass surgery .     nsaids may increase the chance of serious stomach and bowel side effects like ulcers and bleeding . this risk may be greater in older individuals . these side effects can occur without warning signs .     what are some common side effects of nsaids ?     side effects may occur if you are taking large doses of nsaids , or if you are taking them for a long time . some side effects are mild and go away , while others are more serious and need medical attention .     please note : the side effects listed below are the most common . all possible side effects are not included . always contact your healthcare provider if you have questions about your particular medication .     the most frequently reported side effects of nsaids are gastrointestinal symptoms , such as :     gas     feeling bloated     heartburn     stomach pain     nausea     vomiting     diarrhea and/or constipation     these side effects can generally be relieved by taking the drug with adequate amounts of food . nsaids may also be taken with milk or antacids ( such as maalox \u00ae or mylanta \u00ae ) to prevent gastrointestinal symptoms .     if the symptoms continue , the nsaid may need to be stopped . you should contact your healthcare provider if the symptoms listed above do not stop after a few days of taking the nsaid with food , milk , or antacids .     some other side effects of nsaids include :     dizziness     feeling lightheaded     problems with balance     difficulty concentrating     mild headaches     if these symptoms continue for more than a few days , stop taking the nsaid and contact your healthcare provider for more instructions .     what side effects should i tell my healthcare provider about right away ?     if you have any of the following side effects , it is important to call your healthcare provider right away .     fluid retention ( recognized by swelling of the mouth , face , lips or tongue , around the ankles , feet , lower legs , hands , and possibly around the eyes )     ringing in the ears     severe rash or hives or red , peeling skin     itching     unexplained bruising and bleeding     unusual weight gain     black stools \u2013 bloody or black , tarry stools     bloody or cloudy urine     severe stomach pain     blood or material that looks like coffee grounds in vomit ( bleeding may occur without warning symptoms like pain )     blurred vision     wheezing , trouble breathing , or unusual cough     chest pain , rapid heartbeat , palpitations     acute fatigue , flu-like symptoms     jaundice     photosensitivity ( greater sensitivity to light )     change in strength on one side is greater than the other , trouble speaking or thinking , change in balance     inability to pass urine , or change in how much urine is passed     very bad back pain     very bad headache     feeling very tired and weak     can i take nsaids if i ' m being treated for high blood pressure ?     nsaids can raise blood pressure in some people . some people with high blood pressure ( hypertension ) may have to stop taking nsaids , if they notice that their blood pressure increases even if they are taking their blood pressure medications and following their diet . if you are taking blood pressure medication , talk to your healthcare provider before taking nsaids .     is there anyone who should not take nsaids ?     people who have the following conditions or circumstances should not use any type of nsaid until they are first evaluated by their healthcare provider :     children and teenagers with viral infections ( with or without fever ) should not receive aspirin or aspirin-containing products due to the risk of reye ' s syndrome .     those who have an upcoming surgical procedure , including dental surgery     diabetes that is difficult to control     known kidney disease     known liver disease     known allergies to medications , especially aspirin , other nsaids , and sulfa drugs     nasal polyps ( linked to a greater chance of nsaid allergy )     active peptic ulcer disease ( stomach ulcers or previous history of stomach ulcer bleeding )     gastroesophageal reflux disease , also known as gerd     crohn \u2019 s disease or ulcerative colitis     bleeding problems ( people who have a history of prolonged bleeding time or who bruise easily )     people who have three or more alcoholic beverages per day     high blood pressure that is difficult to control     active congestive heart failure     asthma that gets worse when taking aspirin     pregnancy in the third trimester     history of stroke or heart attack     if you are 65 years of age or older     simultaneous use with certain medications such as warfarin ( coumadin \u00ae ) , clopidogrel ( plavix ) , corticosteroids ( for example , prednisone ) , phenytoin ( dilantin \u00ae ) , cyclosporine ( neoral \u00ae , sandimmune \u00ae ) , probenecid , lithium ( lithobid \u00ae ) and drugs used for various disease states such as arthritis , diabetes , high blood pressure , heart disease , and vitamins and other dietary/herbal supplements     ) , clopidogrel ( plavix ) , corticosteroids ( for example , prednisone ) , phenytoin ( dilantin ) , cyclosporine ( neoral , sandimmune ) , probenecid , lithium ( lithobid ) and drugs used for various disease states such as arthritis , diabetes , high blood pressure , heart disease , and vitamins and other dietary/herbal supplements phenylketonuria ( pku ) . some nonprescription nsaids are sweetened with aspartame , a source of phenylalanine .     before you start taking over-the-counter nsaids , have your physician or pharmacist evaluate all of your current medications to see if there would be any potential interactions .     can nsaids cause allergic reactions ?     very rarely , a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent can cause a generalized allergic reaction known as anaphylactic shock . if this happens , it usually occurs soon after the person starts taking the nsaid . the symptoms of this reaction include :     swollen eyes , lips , or tongue     difficulty swallowing     shortness of breath     rapid heart rate     chest pain     decrease in sedation     if any of these symptoms occur , call 9-1-1 or have someone drive you to the nearest emergency room immediately .     before medication is prescribed , tell your healthcare provider :     if you are allergic to any medications , foods , or other substances     if you are currently taking any other medications ( including over-the-counter medications ) and/or herbal or dietary supplements     if you are pregnant , planning to become pregnant , or are breast-feeding     if you have problems taking any medications     if you have anemia , kidney or liver disease , stomach or peptic ulcers , heart disease , high blood pressure , bleeding or clotting problems , asthma , or growth in the nose ( nasal polyps )     before you start taking any new medication , ask your healthcare provider :     what is the name of the medication ?

( wncn ) \u2013 for the last several years , the fda has warned that ibuprofen , naproxen and other nsaid-type painkillers may cause an increased risk for heart disease and stroke .     now the fda has strengthened its warning for these drugs and says that these agents absolutely do raise the risk for heart attack and stroke .     the fda said it reviewed a large number of studies that supported the conclusion that the medicines caused increased risk . the studies estimated that the relative risk increased by 10 percent to 50 percent , depending on the drugs and the doses considered .     the new fda warning covers drugs called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or nsaids for short . they include ibuprofen , sold under brand names like advil or motrin ; naproxen ( aleve ) , as well as prescription arthritis drugs known as cox-2 inhibitors , such as celebrex .     ibuprofen and other nsaids work by inhibiting production of prostaglandins \u2014 ( by inhibiting an enzyme called cyclooxygenase ) . prostaglandins are chemicals released by injured cells that trigger inflammation and pain . it is important to remember that tylenol , known generically as acetaminophen , is not an nsaid and works in a different way . it is not included in this new fda warning . tylenol also has potential health risks and this includes liver damage and toxicity when taken in very high doses .     prescription nsaids are an important treatment for the symptoms of many debilitating conditions , including arthritis , rheumatoid arthritis\u200e , gout and other rheumatological conditions .     nsaids are used to temporarily reduce fever and to treat minor aches and pains such as headaches , toothaches , backaches , muscular aches , tendonitis , strains , sprains and menstrual cramps .     remember that in addition , some combination medicines that relieve various symptoms , such as multi-symptom cold products , contain nsaids .     according to an fda spokesman , the \u201cfda is strengthening an existing warning in prescription drug labels and over-the-counter ( otc ) drug facts labels to indicate that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can increase the chance of a heart attack or stroke , either of which can lead to death. \u201d     the fda has carefully reviewed the data for the last year and has found that in numerous studies it has been clear that the use of nsaids is associated with an increased risk for heart disease and stroke .     some of the studies they looked at showed a clear pattern : people who took nsaids were more likely to have heart attacks or strokes . many of the researchers found that the time course of the development of heart disease can be both early and late in the course of starting nsaids .     the fda added a boxed warning to prescription drug labels for the increased risk for heart disease and stroke in 2005. more recent data has now prompted the fda to update nsaid labeling .     today we know that the risk of heart attack and stroke may occur early in treatment , even in the first weeks . people who have cardiovascular disease , particularly those who recently had a heart attack or cardiac bypass surgery , are at the greatest risk for cardiovascular adverse events associated with nsaids . this particular population is at very high risk \u2014 they are quite vulnerable and should avoid nsaids when possible .     the bottom line is that nsaids are effective treatments for pain , inflammation and fever .     consumers can still take them but should be aware of this increased risk of heart attack or stroke , especially at higher doses .     if you have heart disease or high blood pressure , talk with your doctor before using an nsaid .     together , with your doctor , you must balance the benefits of nsaids with the possible risks .     seek urgent medical attention and stop taking nsaids if you experience symptoms that might signal heart problems or stroke \u2014 chest pain , trouble breathing , sudden weakness in one part or side of the body , or sudden slurred speech . if you take these drugs , take the smallest effective dose .     to get in touch with dr. campbell , you can head to his

the white house also announced that washington will send a representative to syria peace talks scheduled in astana , kazakhstan , on may 3 and 4.     a kremlin statement said the emphasis of their phone conversation was on coordinating russian and u.s. actions in the fight against terrorism .     it said the two agreed to increase dialogue between u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov in an attempt to bring a resolution to the war in syria .     moscow also said trump and putin both expressed support for the idea of organizing their first face-to-face meeting on the sidelines of the july 7-8 summit of the group of 20 ( g20 ) in hamburg , germany .     on north korea , the kremlin said putin called upon trump to show restraint and make an effort to reduce tensions that have been raised in the aftermath of north korea ' s nuclear-weapons and ballistic-missile tests .     several hours before their phone conversation , putin met with german chancellor angela merkel in the russian black sea port of sochi for talks focusing on the conflicts in ukraine and syria , as well as on strained bilateral relations .     both leaders said after their may 2 meeting that it is essential for all parties to fulfill their commitments under the minsk process to regulate the conflict in eastern ukraine between government forces and russia-backed separatists .     \" today we once again reiterated the necessity of the strict observation of the minsk agreements by the parties to the conflict [ in eastern ukraine ] , \" putin told journalists .     merkel said moscow and berlin \" are of differing opinions about the cause of the conflict . \" she said it was essential for kyiv to regain complete control of its border , including the portion between the separatist-controlled areas and russia .     putin and merkel also discussed the six-year-old civil war in syria . putin repeated russia ' s calls for an \" impartial investigation \" into the alleged use of chemical weapons in syria ' s idlib province last month that left about 80 people dead .     putin also said russia was counting on the united states to help find \" efficient solutions \" to the conflict in syria .     merkel said she spoke to putin about domestic developments in russia , including the arrests of demonstrators at recent anticorruption rallies and media reports about the persecution of homosexual men in the russian north caucasus region of chechnya .     \" the possibility of the right to demonstrate is a part of civil society , \" merkel said .     she also urged putin to \" use his influence \" to put an end to the abuse of homosexuals in chechnya .     russia ' s novaya gazeta reported in april that at least 100 gay men had been abducted by security forces in chechnya and at least three had been killed .     putin defended the actions of russian police , saying they acted within the framework of the law and showed \" far more restraint than their colleagues in other european countries . \"     putin also categorically rejected allegations that moscow interfered in the u.s. presidential election in november or was playing any role in germany ' s domestic politics .     the russia leader said it was \" unthinkable \" that russia would interfere in the domestic affairs of other countries . he dismissed the reports of interference in the u.s. election as \" rumors . \" putin added that moscow would not tolerate outside interference in its own domestic affairs .     in january , the u.s. intelligence community issued an assessment charging that putin \" ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the u.s. presidential election . \" security agencies in germany , france , and other countries have also alleged russian efforts to influence their electoral processes .     for her part , merkel said she was confident germany could handle any disinformation campaigns and would take \" decisive measures \" in the event of interference . she also noted that \" hybrid warfare plays a role in russia ' s military doctrine . \"     the two leaders also discussed preparations for the g20 ) summit in hamburg on july 7-8. the g20 is now the chief format for russia to meet the other world powers after its exclusion from the group of eight ( g8 ) , which is now the g7 .     in addition to his talks with merkel , putin is scheduled to talk by telephone with u.s. president donald trump later on may 2.     merkel ' s one-day trip was her second visit to russia since moscow seized the crimean peninsula from ukraine in march 2014.     russia and germany have scaled back ties and merkel has strongly backed eu sanctions on moscow for seizing crimea and for its involvement in the war that has killed more than 9,900 people in eastern ukraine since 2014.     a key mediator in the conflict , which pits russia-backed separatists against ukrainian government forces , merkel is a major proponent of keeping the sanctions on moscow in place until a stalled peace plan is fulfilled .     merkel has attended several meetings with putin , ukrainian president petro poroshenko , and france ' s francois hollande aimed at implementing the minsk ii agreement , which she and hollande brokered in february 2015.     the most recent such meeting was held in october and the four leaders spoke by phone in april , agreeing to step up implementation of the peace deal .     with reporting by dpa , ap , tass , and reuters\n"}, {"url": "file://val/61/2/2", "title": "val/61/2/2", "content":

nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) can increase the chance of a heart attack or stroke , either of which can lead to death . those serious side effects can occur as early as the first few weeks of using an nsaid , and the risk might rise the longer people take nsaids . ( although aspirin is also an nsaid , this revised warning doesn \u2019 t apply to aspirin. )     the otc drugs in this group are used for the temporary relief of pain and fever . the prescription drugs in this group are used to treat several kinds of arthritis and other painful conditions . because many prescription and otc medicines contain nsaids , consumers should avoid taking multiple remedies with the same active ingredient .     the risks and what \u2019 s new     prescription nsaids are an important treatment for the symptoms of many debilitating conditions , including osteoarthritis , rheumatoid arthritis\u200e , gout and other rheumatological and painful conditions . otc nsaids are used to temporarily reduce fever and to treat minor aches and pains such as headaches , toothaches , backaches , muscular aches , tendonitis , strains , sprains and menstrual cramps . common otc nsaids include ibuprofen ( motrin , advil ) and naproxen ( aleve ) . in addition , some combination medicines that relieve various symptoms , such as multi-symptom cold products , contain nsaids .     \u201cbe careful not to take more than one product that contains an nsaid at a time , \u201d says karen m. mahoney , m.d. , deputy director of fda \u2019 s division of nonprescription drug products . how will you know ?
