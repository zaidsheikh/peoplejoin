james neff \u00b7 june 23 - july 7 , 2002             chapter 13 :     on the case     a french-speaking fbi agent in seattle , who knew an algerian accent when he heard it , was the right man to question benni noris .     learn more about the 1999 wto riots in seattle .     even humphries , a wiry , high-energy , third-year man , was ready for a breather and a good night ' s sleep . but seconds into the phone conversation , he was fully alert .     agent patrick gahan , calling from port angeles , wash. , across puget sound on the olympic peninsula , was calling about an arrest humphries had heard a bit about earlier that evening . u.s. customs officers had detained a suspicious man coming by ferry from canada . in his trunk were bags of white powder , mysterious chemicals and homemade timing devices .     the detainee , benni noris , seemed to speak only french . gahan didn ' t , so he was calling humphries \u0097 who had learned french as a high-school student in ontario , canada \u0097 to help .     give me a few minutes to get to the office , humphries told gahan . when he got downtown , humphries obtained a copy of the standard miranda-rights card in french . he called the customs trailer in port angeles and spoke to the suspect on a speaker phone .     humphries read noris his rights in french . then he asked , \" voulez-vous parler de ce qui est arriv\u00e9 ? \" do you want to talk about what has occurred ?     \" non monsieur , je ne veux pas en parler . \" no sir , i do not want to talk about it .     that single sentence told humphries plenty . he asked that gahan turn off the speaker and get on the line .     what id does this guy have ? humphries asked . a canadian passport and baptismal certificate from montreal , with the name benni antoine noris , came the reply .     \" there is no way this guy is who he says he is , \" humphries said . \" there ' s no way he ' s from montreal . \"     the agent knew quebecois french \u0097 and this wasn ' t it . the accent , he thought , sounded like that of a language instructor he had in the army \u0097 a man from algeria .     humphries , gahan and customs officials decided to hold the suspect on suspicion of using false identification . they needed to buy time to sort this out .     the next morning , humphries wrote up his \" 302 , \" fbi parlance for the form used to detail the events of the night before . he gave it to bob houston , who oversees agents on the seattle counterterrorism desk , expecting houston to assign the case to a more experienced agent .             steve ringman / the seattle times seattle fbi agent fred humphries ' first terrorism case was a big one : ahmed ressam . with only three years \u2019 tenure at the bureau , he didn \u2019 t expect to be assigned a major international case .     humphries , 34 , grew up in steilacoom , wash. , went to high school in canada and joined the u.s. army . he climbed steadily through the ranks , but as a captain in military intelligence he feared he was on track to be a career pencil pusher . he decided to go back to school , winning a scholarship to the university of tampa and studying criminology .     he spent a summer during college as an intern with the sheriff ' s office in sangamon county , ill. , where his stepfather was the chief medical examiner . he met fbi agents working on a missing-persons case , and he was hooked .     here he was with his own major international case . it was a keen responsibility \u0097 coordinating with federal prosecutors , assigning tasks , conducting interviews and keeping track of evidence .     all this would be especially daunting because the seattle office was in disarray . it had just been moved into new quarters . agents hadn ' t been assigned desks or phones , and their files were stored in boxes . the one working phone line did not accept direct-dial , long-distance calls . agents were running around with pockets full of quarters , searching for a pay phone that wasn ' t already tied up . at one point , fbi director louis freeh called the seattle office for an update but gave up trying to get through .     when humphries finally found a phone , he contacted the bureau ' s hazardous materials team in quantico , va. , and asked for specialists to join him . and he began digging for details on the mysterious benni noris . noris had no criminal history in canada and had never been to the u.s. , according to a review of canadian and u.s. databases .     the next day , humphries drove to port angeles with two hazmat agents and set up a post at the port angeles airport . there , he took a call from an fbi agent based in ottawa , the canadian capital . the ottawa agent had been given a photograph by the canadian security intelligence service that might match humphries ' mysterious mr. noris .     the agent faxed over the photo , saying only : \" if this is your guy , you ' ve got trouble . \" no explanation ; no name .     humphries took the picture to the clallam county jail . the suspect looked drawn , with dark rings under his eyes . but humphries found his resemblance to the photo unmistakable .     the man before him was not benni noris . but who was he ?\n"}, {"url": "file://val/7/2/1", "title": "val/7/2/1", "content": "you must enter the characters with black color that

about their military service .     \u201cit was more of a father-son conversation as opposed to a judge talking to someone and sentencing them . it was personal , \u201d serna said .     olivera , who

.     so when both managed to get a rare day off work , they left their 22-month-old daughter with a sitter and went to a movie .     \" i was just so excited and looking forward to spending the day with the love of my life , \" said nicole oulson , who met the tall ex-navy sailor while the two worked at a jacksonville bank about 14 years ago .     the oulsons were at the cobb grove 16 in wesley chapel on jan. 13 for a matinee of lone survivor when a man behind them became agitated because chad oulson was texting on his phone during previews .     authorities say curtis reeves jr. , also a navy veteran and a retired tampa police captain , left the theater to complain to management , then returned and started arguing with chad oulson . witnesses said oulson threw a bag of popcorn at reeves , who then pulled a .380 semiautomatic pistol and fired once .     on wednesday , her face pale and drawn , nicole oulson spoke out for the first time about her husband ' s death , calling it \" unimaginable . \"     \" in the blink of an eye my whole world just got shattered into a million pieces , \" oulson , 33 , tearfully told the media gathered at a news conference in her attorneys ' office . \" now i ' m left trying to pick them up and trying to put them all back together .     \" it ' s so hard and so unbearable , \" she added before leaving the room .     reeves , 71 , is in jail in pasco county , charged with second-degree murder .     attorney stephen leal , a member of the law firm hired by mrs. oulson , said his client would oppose bail for reeves , who has a court hearing set for feb. 5. leal said it might be tough to argue that reeves , who spent most of his life in the area , is a flight risk . but it could be successfully argued that he poses a danger to the community .     \" i don ' t know how anybody could be able to convince a judge \u2026 the community is safe if this man is out , \" he said .     attorney tj grimaldi said nicole oulson was surprised that reeves ' attorney said he acted in self-defense .     \" i think she ' s kind of shocked , \" he said . \" she doesn ' t understand what he was defending himself over . \"     grimaldi wouldn ' t close the door on suing the alabama-based cobb theater chain but would not comment further .     \" we ' re exploring all options , but our main focus right now is to guide her through this difficult time of grief , her own personal injury and the entire circus that is the criminal case , \" he said . \" it ' s sad when it ' s gotten to this level that we can ' t go to a movie theater and feel safe . \"     florida law allows two years for a wrongful death case to be filed and four years for an injury lawsuit .     attorney brandon scheele , who has defended corporations in injury and death cases , said he thinks the plaintiffs would have a difficult time . the law requires them to prove that the shooting was \" foreseeable and preventable . \" reeves simply complaining to management about someone texting wouldn ' t be enough , he said .     \" he ' d have to have said he was going to shoot the guy \" if employees didn ' t take action , scheele said .     personal injury attorney hutch brock said the substance of reeves ' complaint \u2014 who he talked to and what he said \u2014 would also be critical in determining whether there was negligence by the theater staff . if reeves , who has been accused of complaining about another patron ' s texting about a month before the shooting , had a reputation for making threats , \" then i think the movie theater likely had some kind of a higher duty than just to let this guy keep coming back in . \"     he said most personal injury lawyers allow the police to do their jobs before deciding whether to sue .     \" they try to stay out of their way , \" brock said .     the oulsons ' daughter , alexis , is too young to be fully aware of what has happened but she \" knows that daddy ' s gone , \" grimaldi said .     nicole oulson said alexis is where her focus is now \" and always will be . \"     the attorneys said a trust fund has been set up to help oulson ' s family . in a grass roots movement , businesses have held fundraisers and donated proceeds . in all , more than $ 20,000 has accumulated .     grimaldi said nicole oulson has been touched by the community ' s generosity . \" she didn ' t expect this , \" he

, fla. \u2014 the f.b.i . agent who spurred the investigation that led to the resignation of david h. petraeus as c.i.a . director is a \u201chard-charging \u201d veteran who helped investigate the foiled millennium terrorist plot in 1999 , colleagues said on wednesday .     the agent , frederick w. humphries ii , 47 , is also described by former colleagues as relentless in his pursuit of what he sees as wrongdoing , which appears to describe his role in the f.b.i . investigation involving mr. petraeus . suspecting that the case involved serious security issues and was being stalled , possibly for political reasons \u2014 a suspicion his superiors say was unjustified \u2014 he took his concerns to congressional republicans .     \u201cfred is a passionate kind of guy , \u201d one former colleague said . \u201che \u2019 s kind of an obsessive type . if he locked his teeth onto something , he \u2019 d be a bulldog. \u201d     the question of how and why the f.b.i . opened the investigation that has had such momentous consequences has been central from the moment mr. petraeus stepped down friday . the emerging portrait of the agent who initiated the inquiry is another step toward an answer .     mr. humphries , who was identified on wednesday by law enforcement colleagues , took the initial complaint from jill kelley , a tampa woman active in local military circles and a personal friend , about anonymous e-mails that accused her of inappropriately flirtatious behavior toward mr. petraeus .     the subsequent cyberstalking investigation uncovered an extramarital affair between mr. petraeus and paula broadwell , his biographer , who agents determined had sent the anonymous e-mails . it also ensnared gen. john r. allen , the commander of nato forces in afghanistan , after f.b.i . agents discovered what a law enforcement official said on wednesday were sexually explicit e-mail exchanges between him and ms. kelley .     a spokesman for ms. kelley provided her version of events in two conference calls with reporters on wednesday . ms. kelley \u2019 s concern when she took the e-mails to mr. humphries was that she feared the sender was \u201cstalking \u201d mr. petraeus and general allen , said the spokesman , who asked not to be identified .     \u201cshe asks the agent , \u2018what do you make of this? \u2019 \u201d the spokesman said . \u201cthe agent said : \u2018this is serious . they seem to know the comings and goings of a couple of generals. \u2019 \u201d     general allen himself had received a similar anonymous e-mail message , sent by someone identified as \u201ckelleypatrol , \u201d advising him to stay away from ms. kelley . the general forwarded it to ms. kelley , and they discussed a concern that someone was cyberstalking them .     on tuesday , defense secretary leon e. panetta said he had asked the senate to postpone a confirmation hearing for general allen \u2019 s next assignment while the department \u2019 s inspector general reviewed his e-mail correspondence with ms. kelley , which was discovered by f.b.i . agents investigating her initial complaint .     pentagon officials said the review covered more than 10,000 pages of documents that included \u201cinappropriate \u201d messages . but associates of general allen have said that the two exchanged about a dozen e-mails a week since meeting two years ago and that his messages were affectionate but platonic .     a law enforcement official , speaking on the condition of anonymity , disputed that assertion on wednesday , saying some messages were clearly sexual . investigators were confident \u201cthe nature of the content warranted passing them on \u201d to the inspector general , the official said .     in a statement on wednesday , general allen \u2019 s military counsel said he intended to cooperate fully with the inspector general \u2019 s investigation . \u201cto the extent there are questions about certain communications by general allen , he shares in the desire to resolve those questions as completely and quickly as possible , \u201d said the statement from col. john g. baker , the chief defense
