andrea catherwood     ( updates shares , bonds in eighth paragraph. )     april 18 ( bloomberg ) -- irish prime minister enda kenny said the nation won \u2019 t default on its debt as he tries to rebuild confidence at a time when investors speculate greece may struggle to pay back its borrowings .     \u201cthe greek government will obviously deal with this problem in the best way it can , \u201d said kenny , 59 , in an interview with andrea catherwood on bloomberg television \u2019 s \u201clast word \u201d in london today . \u201cwe have no intention of defaulting . we \u2019 ve made that perfectly clear . we want to continue to pay our way. \u201d     irish , greek and portuguese bonds fell today amid mounting speculation greece will have to restructure its debt . all three countries have sought bailouts from the european union and international monetary fund , and kenny \u2019 s government wants a reduction on the rate on its loans , which he has described as \u201ctoo severe. \u201d     \u201cwe \u2019 re not looking for more money from europe , we \u2019 re looking for greater flexibility , \u201d kenny said , referring to the rate on the bailout and to medium-term financing for lenders from the european central bank . he also said that an increase in ireland \u2019 s 12.5 percent corporation-tax rate to appease fellow eu leaders is \u201cnot up for negotiation. \u201d     ireland \u2019 s government last month pledged to inject additional capital of as much as 24 billion euros ( $ 34 billion ) into lenders after mounting losses forced the country ask for external help in november . finance minister michael noonan said on april 8 it \u2019 s important to reach an agreement on lower bailout rates before the country taps \u201cserious tranches of money. \u201d     bonds fall     kenny said that anglo irish bank corp. , which is being wound down , may not need further capital . ireland has injected 29.3 billion euros into the nationalized lender over the past two years . he also said its senior bondholders may be treated differently than those at allied irish banks plc and bank of ireland plc , which the government says won \u2019 t have losses imposed on them .     \u201cthe indications are that it won \u2019 t need extra capital , \u201d kenny said , ahead of a planned update in may on the cost of bailing out anglo irish and smaller rival irish nationwide building society . \u201cwe \u2019 ve made it perfectly clear that senior bondholders in anglo irish and inbs \u201d are a \u201cdifferent category \u201d to those in ireland \u2019 s other banks , he said .     irish bonds fell today , pushing the yield on the country \u2019 s 10-year debt to 9.76 percent at the close of trading in london , the highest in two weeks . the yield on greek and portuguese bonds of the same maturity rose to euro-era records . european shares declined , with the stoxx europe 600 index dropping 1.7 percent .     kenny said ireland \u2019 s government has \u201cplenty of time \u201d before interest payments due in october or november \u201cto demonstrate the seriousness of intent \u201d about tackling the country \u2019 s banking and fiscal problems .     \u201cwe believe that growth projections and initiatives that were taken will lead ireland to a position where we fix what \u2019 s been broken \u201d and generate economic growth , he said .     -- with assistance from dara doyle and joanna starritt in london . editors : fergal o \u2019 brien , simone meier     to contact the reporters on this story : joe

"content": "berlin/athens ( reuters ) - fresh fears that greece will have to restructure its mountain of debt , possibly as early as this summer , sent the euro and some euro zone bond prices tumbling on monday as the bloc ' s debt crisis escalated .     german government sources told reuters in berlin that they did not believe greece , which sealed a 110 billion euro ( $ 158 billion ) bailout from the eu and imf a year ago , would make it through the summer without a restructuring .     market confidence was also hit by a new threat to portugal ' s pending bailout from the rise of an anti-euro party in finnish elections .     the anti-euro true finns party scored big gains in a sunday vote and vowed to push for changes to a portuguese rescue by the eu that is expected to total 80 billion euros when it is finalized by a mid-may deadline .     after a brief lull in the eu debt crisis at the start of 2011 , it has blown up again and some analysts are now openly speculating that greece and possibly other countries could eventually be forced to exit the bloc .     \" you may see some countries deciding to leave the euro because they can ' t deal with the fiscal straitjacket that it imposes on them , \" andrew lynch , a fund manager at schroders , told reuters insider .     a restructuring of greek debt would be the first by a west european nation in over half a century and represents a challenge for eu policymakers struggling to reconcile the interests of their citizens with the costly steps needed to preserve the integrity of the 17-nation currency area .     greece , saddled with a debt burden that is expected to swell to 160 percent of gross domestic product by 2013 , has denied repeatedly that it plans to restructure . bank of greece governor george provopoulos warned on monday it would have \" catastrophic consequences . \"     \" to be clear , greece has money , \" when considering the public wealth that could be privatized , ecb executive board member lorenzo bini-smaghi told reuters insider before a new york event sponsored by chatham house , the home of the royal institute of international affairs .     \" you have the alternative of selling assets and accelerating privatization or going in the direction of major financial collapse , which would happen in the case of default or restructuring . \"     but german newspaper die welt quoted an unnamed greek minister as saying it was only a matter of time before the government took such a step .     and government sources in berlin told reuters that some form of debt restructuring now looked unavoidable and suggested greece move fast , rather than wait until its funding situation gets critical next year .     \" decisive voices within the federal government expect that greece will not make it through the summer without a restructuring , \" a high-ranking german coalition source said .     contagion risk     european shares sank to their lowest close in three weeks on monday and the euro fell more than two cents to trade briefly below $ 1.42 , its lowest level against the u.s. dollar in nearly two weeks as the euro zone debt crisis rattled market confidence .     u.s. stocks also took a hit after standard &amp; poor ' s cut its credit outlook for the united states to negative in a reminder that the euro zone is not alone in suffering from high debt and deficits .     the cost of insuring greek debt against default jumped and spanish 10-year bond yields rose toward record highs near 5.6 percent , while portuguese yields hit a new peak of 9.4 percent .     european officials have been at pains to stress that spain can avoid the contagion that has forced greece , ireland and portugal to seek rescues . its much larger economy could strain the bloc ' s resources to breaking point if it did succumb to the need for a debt bailout .     data on monday showed an accelerated drop in spanish housing prices in the first quarter and a surge in yields at a government treasury bill auction .     spain faces a further test of demand for its debt on wednesday when it aims to raise 2.5 to 3.5 billion euros with two long-maturity issues .     greek debt bigger than argentina before default     in order to return greece ' s economy to a sustainable path , most economists agree that it needs to write off roughly half the value of its outstanding debt , hitting private creditors with significant \" haircuts \" on their holdings .     greece ' s debt load of 325 billion euros is nearly double the level most economists see as sustainable and far bigger than that of argentina when it defaulted in late 2001.     but eu leaders have promised not to make private debt holders pay before 2013.     doing so in the near-term , when the bloc remains vulnerable , could raise pressure on portugal and ireland to restructure their debt also , threatening bank balance sheets in the euro zone .     winning creditor agreement for a milder form of restructuring , like a voluntary extension of debt maturities , is likely to be difficult .     and even if it does work , it would probably not make enough of a dent in greece ' s debt burden to ensure sustainability over the longer-term . markets may view the \" restructuring lite \" option as merely the first step in a two-stage restructuring , with the real pain yet to come .     portugal bailout at risk     meanwhile , in neighboring portugal , representatives of the european commission , european central bank and international monetary fund were meeting government officials on monday to set the terms for the bloc ' s third rescue in a year following multi-billion euro deals for greece and ireland .     after the election in finland , however , that bailout could come under threat .     the anti-euro true finns party which scored big gains in the sunday vote , vowed to push for changes to the portuguese rescue .     it may take weeks to find out whether true finns will become part of a new government in helsinki and be able to deliver on that threat . the party that won the most votes in finland is pro-european and seems unlikely to compromise its stance even if it does end up in a coalition with true finns .     but the result underscored the extent of public anger in northern europe at the series of aid deals for stricken euro zone countries that mismanaged their economies and finances .     \" it is extremely difficult for politicians in europe to ignore the strong signal from finland , \" said steen jakobsen , chief economist at saxo bank . \" ultimately this could mean a move away from bailouts with no burden sharing by private investors and banks . \"     any delay in approving the bailout deal for portugal beyond may could leave the country scrambling for new sources of funding . it faces an election on june 5 and has warned it will run out of money around the same time .

parties control which parts of iraq , libya and syria are a hit whenever he posts them on twitter . they have been cited on news stories in the huffington post , lebanon \u2019 s daily star and vox , as well as on the university of texas at austin \u2019 s website . but van linge isn \u2019 t a policy expert and he \u2019 s never been to the region : in fact , he \u2019 s just a dutch high school student who tracks the war on social media .     van linge , who goes by @arabthomness on twitter , has amassed nearly 11,000 followers since joining the platform in january 2013 , the year he published his first map . many of his followers work for influential think tanks or suggest policy for the region he maps .     van linge \u2019 s latest map of conflict-ridden syria , updated june 5 , 2015 , illustrates just how complex the situation in the country has become . in northeastern syrian kurdistan , a tip of yellow is mainly in control of the kurdish ypg ( people \u2019 s protection units ) , while the country \u2019 s west is a mix of red \u2014 representing the regime of syrian president bashar al-assad \u2014 and varied green blotches representing the free syrian army and mixed rebel and jihadi-controlled countryside . the city of aleppo is a palette of colors representing myriad forces like jabhat al-nusra , islamic front and government soldiers vying for power , making normal life for civilians a deadly struggle .     the rest of syria is a vast swath of countryside , colored gray , controlled by the militant group islamic state ( isis ) , and punctuated with black circles denoting isis-controlled towns and cities . the map is corroborated by news reports from last month that say isis now controls around 50 percent of syria .     thomas van linge/newsweek     \u201ci want to inform people mostly and show people the rebel dynamics in the country , \u201d van linge told newsweek , referring to his motivation for creating his maps . \u201ci also want to inform journalists who want to go to the region which regions are definitely no-go zones , which regions are the most dangerous , and also to show strategic developments through time. \u201d     van linge \u2019 s interest in the region was first sparked by the events of the 2011 arab spring , particularly the egyptian revolution . he started following trends in libya and syria and made his first map showing the situation for the ypg and kurdish forces in syrian kurdistan in december 2013. then someone asked him to make a map of syria as a whole .     \u201ci hadn \u2019 t really considered it at the time , but i was annoyed by other maps that didn \u2019 t make the distinction between rebels and isis groups of areas , which were still at the time intertwined , \u201d he said . in the past 16 months , he \u2019 s also made maps of eastern ukraine , somalia , the palestinian territories and the northern part of mali , which saw fighting between al-qaeda and tuareg rebels , although the syria maps get the most attention .     when he starts a new map , which usually takes several weeks to finish alongside his schoolwork , van linge takes a large file of a blank map and uses the most humble of tools to start coloring it in : microsoft paint .     \u201ci \u2019 m not very sophisticated with computers , \u201d he said .     thomas van linge/newsweek     the sources for van linge \u2019 s maps include twitter , facebook and youtube , as well as personal contacts in the region , including within the free syrian army in aleppo and others in the kurdish region north of aleppo . he estimates he has around 1,000 sources for all his maps , which he uses to corroborate claims of territorial control .     \u201cwhen i see , for example , a status update of a rebel group on facebook in which they claim they \u2019 ve captured a small village , then i usually wait until either other sources report it or footage from rebels within that village shows up on youtube before i make the edit on my map , \u201d said van linge .     he then uses a map tool on google earth to make and edit shapes of controlling territories , like the mint green boomerang shape showing a low amount of rebel-controlled countryside in southwestern syria , which he replicates in the paint file .     the finished product is shared on twitter and is often retweeted several times . pieter van ostaeyen , the belgian jihadist expert described by the financial times as an \u201carmchair terrorist tracker , \u201d has also started republishing the maps on his website .     despite van linge \u2019 s age and relative inexperience in the world of foreign affairs , some middle east experts have applaud his maps . joshua landis , director of the center for middle east studies at the university of oklahoma , said he finds the maps \u201camong the most useful , \u201d mainly due to the color blocking system employed by van linge . most mapmakers , landis says , use \u201cspindly strands of highway control \u201d to show the areas run by isis , which might underestimate the group \u2019 s power .     \u201ccontrolling large swaths of desert , where few people live , is strategically important . no one would make a map of algeria or saudi arabia like this , only isis , \u201d said landis . \u201cby updating his maps frequently and sticking to tradition by trying to depict how much actual territory isis controls , thomas van linge does us all a favor. \u201d     rana khalaf , a researcher at the centre for syrian studies at st. andrews university , also found the maps useful , but said it would be helpful to highlight the uninhabited desert regions , as well as to use intersecting lines to show contested areas where control can change overnight .     van ostaeyen , who publishes van linge \u2019 s maps but primarily uses twitter to track and communicate with jihadists , also spoke of how helpful the maps are .     \u201ci found it really interesting to see the evolution of everything going on , \u201d he said . \u201cthomas \u2019 s maps are one of the best published on what \u2019 s going on in syria and iraq. \u201d     at the start of their correspondence , van ostaeyen didn \u2019 t know van linge \u2019 s age and was impressed when he found out he was a teenager . he wasn \u2019 t , however , surprised .     \u201ci \u2019 ve seen so many weird things , like the shami witness case [ van ostaeyen was in close contact with mehdi masroor biswas , the man behind the pro-isis account , who was arrested in bangalore , india , last december ] , that i can \u2019 t be surprised anymore by something , \u201d said van ostaeyen .     van linge \u2019 s twitter feed is more than just maps : it \u2019 s also a valuable resource for news of ongoing humanitarian crises in the region and around the world . he posts photos of the aftermath of shelling and retweets activists who post graphic photos of children killed by weapons in syria . he says he does this to raise awareness now that the international media is largely ignoring daily bomb attacks .     \u201cby tweeting every bombardment , every victim of the assad regime or isis , i believe you \u2019 re reminded of these crimes , these events , \u201d said van linge . \u201cthey \u2019 re ongoing everyday even though they don \u2019 t make headline news anymore.
