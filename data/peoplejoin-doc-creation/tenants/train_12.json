an additional 100 medical personnel headed to beth israel alone .     that ' s all on top of the already-increased staff levels at area hospitals , which typically add more shifts to handle common race injuries on marathon monday .     \" i ' ve never been prouder to work here , \" dr. andrew ulrich , executive vice chairman of boston medical center ' s department of emergency medicine , told the boston herald . \" the staff response was outstanding . \"     as a medical hub , boston ' s hospitals are renowned as being among the country ' s best . last year , u.s. news &amp; world report named massachusetts general ( mgh ) the top hospital in the nation in its annual \" best hospitals \" list . brigham and women ' s hospital took ninth place , while 20 boston hospitals received some kind of ranking . only six cities \u2014 all of them considerably larger than boston , including new york , chicago , and los angeles \u2014 are home to more ranked facilities on that list than boston .     in a separate report , u.s. news also named boston children ' s as the best pediatric hospital in the nation , tied with the children ' s hospital of philadelphia . and two other studies , released in 2009 and 2011 , both named boston as one of the top five medical cities in the country .     \" it is fortuitous that the boston hospitals involved , including massachusetts general hospital , boston children ' s hospital , and tufts medical center , are among the country ' s best , \" says marc siegel in forbes . \" trauma surgeons are trained in these kinds of injuries , and several boston surgeons have experience in iraq and afghanistan that they can bring to bear . \"     given the high number and high caliber of hospitals in boston , massachusetts ' medical centers routinely receive a huge share of federal health dollars . in 2012 , state facilities received $ 2.4 billion in funding from the national institute of health , or roughly 11.3 percent of the nih ' s entire state-level outlays for the year . only california received more funding .     boston has also earned more nih funding than other other city in the country for 17 years straight , according to the globe . in that span , the city ' s medical institutions have been awarded a combined $ 23.4 billion .     boston ' s doctors may also have been particularly well equipped to handle a major disaster response effort . when the state department evacuated libyan rebels to the u.s. two years ago so that they could receive special treatment for their wounds , those patients went to a hospital just outside boston . and at mass general , israeli disaster response experts have worked directly with the hospital to prepare for an urban attack like this one .     \" we \u00adobviously have a limited experience with explosions in an \u00adurban area , \" dr. alasdair conn , mgh ' s chief of emergency services , told the boston globe . \" the israelis , unfortunately , have this several times a year , and we asked their disaster-response teams to come and help us upgrade our disaster response . \"     \" and i ' m very pleased that we went through that orientation and additional training , \" he added .\n"}, {"url": "file://train/12/1/2", "title": "train/12/1/2", "content": "treatments     boston doctors compare marathon bomb injuries to war wounds     i i itoggle caption elise amendola/ap elise amendola/ap     boston hospitals always staff up their emergency rooms on marathon day to care for runners with cramps , dehydration and the occasional heart attack .     but monday , those hospitals suddenly found themselves with more than 100 traumatized patients \u2014 many of them with the kinds of injuries seen more often on a battlefield than a marathon .     like most big-city hospitals these days , tufts medical center runs regular disaster drills , featuring simulated patients smeared with fake blood .     so when word came monday afternoon that there had been an explosion at the boston marathon finish line , staffers weren ' t sure what was happening .     robert osgood , the hospital ' s emergency management chief , recalls those first moments .     ' is this another one of your crazy drills? '     \" there was sort of this beat where everybody in the emergency department sort of stopped for a second . and it was almost like you could hear each other breathing . and everybody looked at me and said , ' is this another one of your crazy drills? ' and the first thing i said was , ' no , this is not a drill . this is for real . we need to huddle up . ' \"     at first they thought it was something accidental , like a manhole cover explosion .     \" but once we actually found out that this was a man-made event , there ' s a certain mental toll that sort of hits a switch in some of the staff . and they say , ' why would somebody do this? ' \" osgood said .     but soon there was no time for such thoughts . terribly injured patients began coming through the emergency room doors of every big hospital in the city .     ' a lot of very horrific injuries '     across town at the beth israel deaconess medical center , emergency room specialist dr. stephen epstein described the carnage :     \" limbs that were severed , limbs that , you know , we hope we can save , and some that we might not be able to save . a lot of very horrific injuries that we saw here today . \"     he said some patients near the blasts had soot around their mouths and noses . that ' s a sign they ' d breathed in scorching air . they needed to be put on ventilators right away , because that kind of burn causes rapid swelling that can shut down people ' s airways and suffocate them .     many had pieces of glass and metal embedded in their chests and necks . ruptured eardrums from the blast were common .     \" the device that went off today , for lack of a better term , was an improvised explosive device . and that ' s exactly what a number of our troops in iraq and afghanistan have had to deal with , \" epstein said .     just the beginning for many victims     and like those wounded troops , doctors say , many of those injured in the blasts monday will require a lot of rehabilitation \u2014 both physical and mental .     \" these were very disabling injuries in that the blast caused a lot of soft tissue injury . but also the shrapnel just rips through the tissues , \" said dr. william mackey , chief of surgery at tufts medical center .     mackey said his hospital quickly canceled all elective surgery as his colleagues tried to repair the damage as well as they could .     patients needed hours of surgery , but mackey said it was just the beginning for many victims .     \" they will definitely need repeated operations , \" he said .     it wasn ' t until 9 p.m. that mackey could sit down in his office and try to absorb the events . he said it had been a very discouraging day .     \" because you don ' t associate the boston marathon with anything but a great sense of pride in the city , pride in the athletes that trained so hard to run the marathon . and to have this happen ... yeah , it ' s very disorienting . it ' s been a very upsetting day in many , many ways , \" mackey said .     but jittery as this city is today , mackey doesn ' t think the marathon bombings are going to intimidate boston in the long haul .     \" i don ' t think bostonians are going to be terrorized by this . i think they ' re gonna be motivated by this . i sure hope more people than ever turn out for next year ' s marathon , \" mackey said .     if they do , it ' s a safe bet all of them will be thinking about what happened at the finish line of the 2013 boston marathon .\n"}, {"url": "file://train/12/2/4", "title": "train/12/2/4", "content": "please enable javascript to watch this video     toms

onslaught that never came . on the morning of september 12 , a sea of empty white gurneys sparkled in front of manhattan \u2019 s st. vincent \u2019 s hospital . the building was already papered with pictures of people who had vanished forever . in boston this week , the aftermath of violence looked different . only three people died within 24 hours of the blast on boylston street . but like the improvised bombings that plague iraq and afghanistan , the attack left scores of civilians mortally injured , many with lower limbs hanging by threads . the incident may be remembered less for the deaths it caused than for the flesh and bone it ravaged .     but the patriots \u2019 day bombing reveals the tremendous strides that emergency physicians have made in the past decade . the assault occurred within blocks of what president obama called \u201csome of the best hospitals in the world. \u201d a medical team was already working the finish line when the shrapnel started flying . and thanks to this country \u2019 s recent experiences in iraq and afghanistan , physicians and emergency workers almost surely saved patients who would have died from the same injuries a decade ago .     for all their failings , america \u2019 s recent foreign wars have driven medical breakthroughs that are now saving civilians at home .     it \u2019 s hardly the first time this has happened . the need to keep wounded fighters alive has long been an engine of medical progress . roughly one soldier died for every 1.7 injured in world war ii . in iraq and afghanistan , one died for every seven wounded \u2014 a decline of more than 75 % . the advances fueling that progress span fields as diverse as orthopedics , pharmacology and bandage design , and most are now common in civilian medicine .     some of the breakthroughs have been astonishingly low-tech . take the tourniquet , for instance , a device that dates back at least to the second century bc . blood loss is the leading cause of death among trauma victims . a tourniquet can stop bleeding cold when applied to an injured arm or a leg . but 20th century medical dogma said it should be used only as a desperate last resort , lest it starve the limb of sustenance . \u201cwe learned early in the iraq war that we needed to test these assumptions , \u201d says dr. andrew pollak , a senior trauma surgeon at the university of maryland school of medicine and the r adams cowley shock trauma center . \u201cso congress has started funding research to compare and evaluate treatment protocols. \u201d     researchers at the army institute of surgical research did just that , and their findings have transformed trauma care . in studies involving more than 2,800 trauma patients at a combat support hospital in baghdad , they found that tourniquets dramatically improved survival following major limb injuries , especially when medics applied them quickly in the field . patients died at more than twice the rate ( 24 % versus 11 % ) when tourniquets were restricted to hospital use . some 87 % of patients bled to death if they didn \u2019 t receive tourniquets at all .     contrary to past fears , the tourniquets themselves didn \u2019 t cause any limb loss , even in the rare cases when patients had to keep them on for two to three hours . \u201cwe \u2019 ve rewritten all the text books to reflect this , \u201d says pollak . \u201cevery paramedic is now trained to apply a tourniquet at the scene of a motor vehicle crash . the message is very clear and well accepted , even in the civilian environment. \u201d     tourniquets figured prominently in the grim tableaus that followed monday \u2019 s blast , and they no doubt kept some survivors alive . they \u2019 re no good for head or abdominal wounds ( \u201cif your scalp is bleeding , a tourniquet to the neck is not helpful , \u201d says pollak ) , but combat physicians have devised other ways to stem blood loss . newly developed dressings can accelerate clotting when applied to an open wound or infused into a bandage . and military research has shown that synthetic clotting factors \u2014 the mainstay of hemophilia treatment \u2014 can quickly stem blood loss when administered to trauma victims .     \u201cwe used to slowly transfuse platelets to help them , \u201d says dr. don vanboerum , director of trauma care at salt lake city \u2019 s intermountain medical center . \u201cnewer treatments like activated factor 7 work almost instantaneously . they carry some risk , but they definitely make a difference. \u201d     blood loss isn \u2019 t the only threat bombing victims face . improvised bombs drive debris and shrapnel deep into the body , shredding the soft tissues that support and nourish bones and seeding potentially deadly infections . once they stabilize a trauma victim , emergency physicians aggressively excise damaged tissues . debridement helps ward off gangrene , but it can also leave shattered bones fully exposed . \u201cit \u2019 s hard to repair pulverized bone under the best of conditions , \u201d says vanboerum . \u201cit \u2019 s impossible if the bone isn \u2019 t sheathed in soft tissue. \u201d     but even that challenge is sometimes surmountable . borrowing from combat surgeons , trauma docs have learned to secure bone fragments with rods that are bolted to a frame surrounding the injured limb . and if a shattered bone lacks soft-tissue cover , a plastic surgeon can sometimes transfer live muscle tissue \u2014 blood vessels intact \u2014 from the back or the forearm to the site of the injury . \u201cif it works , \u201d says vanboerum , \u201cyou end up with a blood supply that can keep the tissue alive and carry antibiotics into it while the bone starts to heal. \u201d     there are limits , though . even when surgeons can reconstruct a leg this way , they can \u2019 t always salvage the nerves needed to preserve sensation in the foot . and as vanboerum puts it , \u201can insensate limb isn \u2019 t a good outcome. \u201d a foot that lacks feeling is prone to sores and injuries that can lead to infection and , ultimately , amputation . so trauma patients sometimes face a stark choice : give up the shattered limb at the outset , and learn to use a prosthesis , or embark on a long surgical odyssey that may ultimately fail . a wise surgeon may advise the patient to give it up and move on .     that may sound harsh , but military research has greatly revolutionized prosthetic limbs in recent years , and studies suggest that wounded veterans often prefer them to salvaged but damaged limbs . civilian research suggests that patients fare about equally well with amputation or limb-salvaging surgery . but in a study called metals ( for military extremity trauma amputation/limb salvage ) , researchers assessed outcomes among 317 u.s. service members whose legs were damaged by bombs in iraq or afghanistan . though all of them were significantly disabled three years after their injuries , the amputees reported greater mobility and less emotional distress than those who had kept their limbs .     these warriors \u2019 experiences may tell us little about the folks now fighting for their lives in boston hospitals . but they suggest that life and hope can survive even the most harrowing trauma . improvised explosives don \u2019 t discriminate between soldiers and civilians . people who encounter them come home broken . but as trauma surgery improves , more and more of them will come home .\n"}, {"url": "file://train/12/2/5", "title":

criticism for calling islam and mormonism \" a heresy from the pit of hell \" and saying jews \" can ' t be saved . \"     romney writes on twitter that \" such a religious bigot should not be giving the prayer that opens the united states embassy in jerusalem . \"     ___     9 : 15 a.m.     a senior aide to palestinian president mahmoud abbas has sharply criticized president donald trump over his decision to open a u.s. embassy in contested jerusalem , saying the american administration is \" based on lies . \"     saeb erekat told the voice of palestine radio monday that trump violated a promise to hold off on moving the embassy to give peace talks a chance . erekat says washington \" is no longer a partner . \"     in december , trump recognized jerusalem as israel ' s capital , infuriating palestinians who seek the israeli-annexed eastern sector as a capital . the u.s. embassy in jerusalem opens monday .     erekat says the trump administration has \" become part of the problem . \" he suggested trump ' s mideast team is unqualified , saying \" the world needs real leaders , and those ( white house officials ) are real estate dealers , not leaders . \"     ___     9 : 05 a.m.     japan ' s chief cabinet secretary has expressed concern that the relocation of the u.s. embassy in israel could escalate tensions in the middle east .     yoshihide suga said monday that \" japan is concerned that the move could make peace process in the middle east even more difficult or escalate tension in all of the middle east . \" he says japan will watch the development with great interest .     suga stopped short of criticizing the u.s. , and said that japan takes note of washington ' s pledge that the issue of jerusalem ' s status should be resolved between the concerned parties .     he stressed that japan ' s position is that the disputes and jerusalem ' s status should be resolved via negotiations between israelis and palestinians . suga added that japan hopes to contribute in its own way to the region ' s peace by promoting trust and dialogue between the two parties through various projects .     the relocation of the embassy from tel aviv to contested jerusalem has been welcomed by israel but condemned by the palestinians , who want their capital to be in east jerusalem and view the decision as a blatantly one-sided move on one of the thorniest disputes in the conflict .     ___     9 a.m.     president donald trump ' s mideast peace negotiator says moving the american embassy to jerusalem is a \" necessary condition \" to a lasting peace deal between israel and the palestinians .     american officials are in jerusalem for monday ' s relocation of the embassy from tel aviv to the contested city , a move the israeli government has embraced but the palestinians have condemned .     jason greenblatt writes on twitter that \" the long-overdue step of moving our embassy is not a departure from our strong commitment to facilitate a lasting peace deal . \"     israel captured east jerusalem in the 1967 mideast war and annexed it in a move not recognized internationally . the palestinians want east jerusalem as the capital of their future state . they view the relocation as a blatant , one-sided move that invalidates america ' s role as an impartial peace broker .     ___     8 : 30 a.m.     israel has warned gaza residents they will be risking their lives if they approach the border during a planned mass protest .     the army says in the leaflets dropped by jets monday that it will \" act against every attempt to damage the security fence or harm idf soldiers or israeli civilians . \"     gaza ' s ruling hamas says it expects tens of thousands to join monday ' s march , suggesting a possible border breach . the march is part of a campaign to break gaza ' s decade-old border blockade . it ' s also a protest against the inauguration monday of a u.s. embassy in contested jerusalem .     since march , 42 palestinian protesters have been killed and more than 1,800 wounded by israeli army fire .     with israel and hamas digging in , there has been concern about large numbers of casualties monday

\u2019 s alabama lake house last april , are speaking out about the rarely reported phenomenon after it took the lives of two more local women this past weekend .     the two women , 34-year-old shelly darling and 41-year-old elizabeth whipple , went missing after sunbathing on lake tuscaloosa friday afternoon . their bodies were retrieved from the lake early saturday morning . preliminary autopsies for the two victims show the cause of death as electrocution , the tuscaloosa county homicide unit told cbs affiliate wiat on wednesday .     \u201ci \u2019 ve been around water all my life and i never thought that electricity in a huge body of water like that could do what it did , \u201d carmen \u2019 s father , jimmy johnson , 49 , told cbs news . \u201cit is something that even people like me now after all these years never had any idea that this even happened. \u201d     jimmy johnson     every day , about 10 people in the u.s. die from accidental drowning , according to the centers for disease control and prevention . but electric shock drownings are difficult to track . it \u2019 s known as a \u201csilent killer. \u201d     even a low level of electric current in the water can be extremely hazardous or fatal to a swimmer -- especially in freshwater , where experts say the voltage will \u201ctake a shortcut \u201d through the human body .     \u201cthere is no visible warning or way to tell if water surrounding a boat , marina or dock is energized or within seconds will become energized with fatal levels of electricity , \u201d the non-profit electric shock drowning prevention association reports .     in fact , johnson says , he never would have known what happened to his daughter if he hadn \u2019 t felt the electric current himself while trying to jump in to save her .     carmen playfully jumped off the top level of the family \u2019 s boat dock into smith lake with her friend reagan gargis on april 16 , 2016. jimmy johnson lowered a metal ladder into the water so the girls could climb out . minutes later , he heard reagan scream , \u201chelp ! \u201d     \u201cmy wife thought [ carmen ] had done something to her neck , which paralyzed her , \u201d johnson said . \u201cshe started going underwater. \u201d     that \u2019 s when johnson and his son , zach , jumped in the water after the girls and immediately felt piercing electric shocks .     \u201ccut the power off , \u201d johnson yelled to his wife as he started to go in and out of consciousness .     johnson , reagan and zach survived , but carmen didn \u2019 t make it .     \u201ccarmen was grabbing [ reagan \u2019 s ] leg and was getting the majority of the shock when i came over , \u201d johnson said .     jimmy johnson     johnson later found a light switch at the dock that was half full of water . when he put the metal ladder into the water , the electrical current from the light switch traveled through the dock to the ladder and into the surrounding water , where the girls were swimming .     \u201cas they were swimming toward the dock , within somewhere between the 5-to-10-foot range , is when they started feeling like they couldn \u2019 t swim , \u201d johnson recalled .     johnson believes that if his family had been educated about electric shock drownings this might never have happened . now he \u2019 s sharing carmen \u2019 s story as a warning to others , along with tips to help prevent similar tragedies from occurring .     his safety tips include :     use a plastic ladder , rather than a metal one , so it won \u2019 t help transfer electricity into the water .     if you start to feel a tingle in the water , swim away from the dock , which is where most electrical issues occur .     check all of the wiring around your dock , including your ground fault circuit breaker .     purchase a dock lifeguard , a device that detects electricity on your dock and in the water around your dock .

known about the electrocution if others hadn ' t been in the water and felt the shock . the electrocution can paralyze swimmers , making it difficult for them to get out of the water .     the current that shocked carmen johnson was caused by water seeping into a light switch box at the family ' s dock , according to her mother . when the metal ladder was put in the water , the electrical current

caused by electric shock .     authorities suspect electric shock played a role in the deaths of darling and whipple because an investigator was shocked during the search saturday . hart said other

\u2019 s demonstrations , which coincided with the opening of the u.s. embassy in jerusalem , were marked by a level of bloodshed not seen in gaza since the 2014 war with israel . israel \u2019 s use of live ammunition has drawn widespread condemnation , notably from turkey , which expelled the israeli ambassador tuesday after recalling its envoys to israel and the united states .     gunfire rang out over gaza city on tuesday as rounds were fired during funeral processions .     further protests were planned as residents attended funerals and prepared to mark the anniversary of israel \u2019 s

demonstrators were asked to go home early as the death toll climbed .     monday \u2019 s killings more than doubled the number of palestinians slain in gaza during six weeks of demonstrations , dubbed the \u201cmarch of return. \u201d more than 2,700 people were injured , the palestinian health ministry in gaza said , about half of them from live ammunition . at least six of the dead were under age 18 , the ministry said , including a girl whose family said she was 14.

unidentified doctor told the associated press on tuesday that the baby , layla ghaben , had a preexisting medical condition and that he did not think her death was caused by tear gas .     one more person was killed in demonstrations tuesday , the health ministry said .     speculation was rife that crowds were thinner because egypt had pressured hamas to order people home . hamas leader ismail haniyeh was summoned to cairo on a last-minute trip sunday night , and senior leaders were noticeably absent from monday \u2019 s demonstrations .     egypt controls gaza \u2019 s southern border ,

warned hamas to prevent an escalation .     he said hamas may have secured some short-term concessions from egypt in return , such as a sustained opening of the rafah crossing point with egypt , which has been open in recent days .     \u201cthis is the minimum they can ask , \u201d yousef said of hamas .     israeli officials justified the military \u2019 s tactics as necessary to stop palestinians from breaking through the border into israel , which blockaded gaza after hamas took control of the enclave in 2007.     rupert colville , spokesman for the office of the united nations high commissioner for human rights , said tuesday that while israel has a right to defend itself , lethal force should be a last resort and was not justified against people who were simply approaching the fence . he condemned monday \u2019 s \u201cappalling deadly violence. \u201d     palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas condemned a continuing \u201cmassacre \u201d of the palestinian

israel in the wake of the violence .     israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu later attacked turkish president recep tayyip erdogan on twitter , saying that he \u201cis one of the great

breach of the border fence , and protesters began to fall . no israeli soldiers were injured .     in gaza , hamas backed the demonstrations , called to protest the loss of palestinian homes and villages when israel was formed in 1948.     commenting in the israeli daily yedioth ahronoth , however , journalist ben-dror yemini said the situation was \u201cself-inflicted \u201d and called on palestinians to get over the events of 70 years ago .     \u201cthere was a nakba . the arabs of palestine underwent expulsion . tens of millions of people throughout the entire world , including jews , underwent similar expulsion . but only the palestinians adopted an ethos of rejectionism , victimhood , suffering and death , \u201d he wrote . \u201cthey aren \u2019 t looking to improve things for

variations of the same gruesome leg injuries . shattered bones , shredded tissue , nails burrowed deep beneath the flesh . the decision had to be made , over and over , with little time to deliberate . should this leg be amputated ? what about this one ?     \u201cas an orthopedic surgeon , we see patients like this , with mangled extremities , but we don \u2019 t see 16 of them at the same time , and we don \u2019 t see patients from blast injuries , \u201d dr. peter burke , the trauma surgery chief at boston medical center , said .     the toll from the bombs monday at the boston marathon , which killed at least three and injured more than 170 , will long be felt by anyone involved with the city \u2019 s iconic sporting event . for the victims , the physical legacy could be an especially cruel one for a group that was involved in the marathon : severe leg trauma and amputations .     \u201cwhat we like to do is before we take off someone \u2019 s leg \u2014 it \u2019 s extremely hard to make that decision \u2014 is we often get two surgeons to agree , \u201d dr. tracey dechert , a trauma surgeon at boston medical , said . \u201cam i right here ? this can \u2019 t be saved . so that way you feel better and know that you didn \u2019 t take off someone \u2019 s leg that you didn \u2019 t have to take . all rooms had multiple surgeons so everyone could feel like we \u2019 re doing what we need to be doing. \u201d     the widespread leg trauma was a result of bombs that seemed to deliver their most vicious blows within two feet of the ground . in an instant , doctors at hospitals throughout the city who had been preparing for ordinary marathon troubles \u2014 dehydration or hypothermia \u2014 now faced profound , life-changing decisions for runners and spectators of all ages .     some victims arrived two to an ambulance , some with huge holes in their legs where skin and fat and muscle were ripped away by the bomb and with ball bearings or nails from the bombs embedded in their flesh . others had severed arteries in their legs or multiple breaks in the bones of their legs and feet . the shock wave from the blast destroyed blood vessels , skin , muscle and fat . and at least nine patients \u2014 five at boston medical center , three at beth israel deaconess hospital and one at brigham and women \u2019 s hospital \u2014 had legs or feet so mangled they would need to be amputated .     some of the attendant medical professionals , said julie dunbar , a chaplain at beth israel , were faced with \u201cmore trauma than most ever see in a lifetime , more sadness , more loss. \u201d     there were only three fatalities , which doctors say was because the blast , low to the ground , mostly injured people \u2019 s legs and feet instead of their abdomens , chests or heads . and tourniquets stopped what could have been fatal bleeding in many .     dr. allan panter , 57 , an emergency-room physician from gainesville , ga. , was standing 10 yards from the blast near the finish line , waiting for his wife , theresa , to complete her 16th boston marathon . assisted by others , he said he used gauze wraps to apply tourniquets to several victims , including a man who appeared to be in his late 20s who lost both of his lower legs in the blast . he said he saw another six or seven victims with belts tied around their wounded legs .     tourniquets , once discouraged because they were thought to cause damage to injuries , have returned to favor and have been used to treat wounds inflicted by explosive devices in the wars in iraq and afghanistan , dr. panter said .     \u201cwith blast injuries to the lower extremities that we \u2019 re getting in the middle east , you bleed out , \u201d he said . tourniquets \u201ccan help save lives . i don \u2019 t know if they helped in this situation , but it sure couldn \u2019 t hurt. \u201d     while there was some initial chaos in a medical tent near the finish line , and some screaming and moaning by victims , it was generally an orderly scene , dr. panter said . he assisted others in wheeling in a female victim who died , he said . he described 20 to 30 cots in the tent with iv bags that had been intended for dehydrated runners .     at least eight doctors and what seemed to be 20 or more nurses were stationed in the tent . a man with a microphone stood in the center of the tent to coordinate medical care . arriving victims were assessed and categorized as 1 for critical , 2 for intermediate , 3 for \u201ccan wait \u201d and \u201cblack tag \u201d for anyone who appeared to be dead , dr. panter said . an emergency medical technician outside the tent coordinated ambulance service to hospitals .     jess bidgood and richard a. oppel jr. contributed reporting
