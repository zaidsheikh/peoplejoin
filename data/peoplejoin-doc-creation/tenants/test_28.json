deadly radiation from an accident now rated at least as bad as america ' s three mile island incident in 1979.     further cabling inside was under way before an attempt to restart water pumps needed to cool overheated nuclear fuel rods at the six-reactor fukushima plant in northeastern japan , 240 km ( 150 miles ) north of tokyo .     japan ' s unprecedented multiple crisis of earthquake , tsunami and radiation leak has unsettled world financial markets , prompted international reassessment of nuclear safety and given the asian nation its sternest test since world war two .     it has also stirred unhappy memories of japan ' s past nuclear nightmare -- the u.s. atomic bombs dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki in 1945.     working inside a 20 km ( 12 miles ) evacuation zone at fukushima , nearly 300 engineers were focused on trying to find a solution by restoring power to pumps in four of the reactors .     \" tepco has connected the external transmission line with the receiving point of the plant and confirmed that electricity can be supplied , \" the plant ' s operator tokyo electric power co said in a statement .     another 1,480 meters ( 5,000 feet ) of cable are being laid inside the complex before engineers try to crank up the coolers at reactor no.2 , followed by numbers 1 , 3 and 4 this weekend , company officials said .     if that works it will be a turning point .     \" if they are successful in getting the cooling infrastructure up and running , that will be a significant step forward in establishing stability , \" said eric moore , a nuclear power expert at u.s.-based focalpoint consulting group .     if not , there is an option of last resort under consideration to bury the sprawling 40-year-old plant in sand and concrete to prevent a catastrophic radiation release .     that method was used to seal huge leakages from the 1986 chernobyl disaster .     underlining authorities ' desperation , fire trucks sprayed water overnight in a crude tactic to cool reactor no.3 , considered the most critical because of its use of mixed oxides , or mox , containing both uranium and highly toxic plutonium .     japan has raised the severity rating of the nuclear crisis to level 5 from 4 on the seven-level ines international scale , putting it on a par with the three mile island accident in 1979 , although some experts say it is more serious .     chernobyl , in ukraine , was a 7 on that scale .     thousands dead , missing and suffering     the operation to avert large-scale radiation has overshadowed the humanitarian aftermath of the 9.0-magnitude quake and 10-meter ( 33-foot ) tsunami that struck on march 11.     nearly 7,000 people have been confirmed killed in the double natural disaster , which turned whole towns into waterlogged and debris-shrouded wastelands .     another 10,700 people are missing with many feared dead .     some 390,000 people , including many among japan ' s aging population , are homeless and battling near-freezing temperatures in shelters in northeastern coastal areas .     food , water , medicine and heating fuel are in short supply .     \" everything is gone , including money , \" said tsukasa sato , a 74-year-old barber with a heart condition , as he warmed his hands in front of a stove at a shelter for the homeless .     health officials and the u.n. atomic watchdog have said radiation levels in the capital tokyo were not harmful . but the city has seen an exodus of tourists , expatriates and many japanese , who fear a blast of radioactive material .     \" i ' m leaving because my parents are terrified . i personally think this will turn out to be the biggest paper tiger the world has ever seen , \" said luke ridley , 23 , from london as he sat at narita international airport using his laptop .     \" i ' ll probably come back in about a month . \"     though there has been alarm around the world , experts have been warning there is little risk of radiation at dangerous levels spreading to other nations .     the u.s. government said \" minuscule \" amounts of radiation were detected in california consistent with a release from japan ' s damaged facility , but there were no levels of concern .     amid their distress , japanese were proud of the 279 nuclear plant workers toiling in the wreckage , wearing masks , goggles and protective suits sealed by duct tape .     \" my eyes well with tears at the thought of the work they are doing , \" kazuya aoki , a safety official at japan ' s nuclear and industrial safety agency , told reuters .     g7 intervention for yen     the group of seven rich nations succeeded in calming global financial markets in rare concerted intervention to restrain a soaring yen .     the dollar surged to 81.98 yen on friday after the g7 moved to pour billions into markets buying dollars , euros and pounds -- the first such joint intervention since the group came to the aid of the newly launched euro in 2000.     the dollar later dropped back to under 81 yen , but it was still far from the record low of 76.25 yen hit on thursday .     \" the only type of intervention that actually works is coordinated intervention , and it shows the solidarity of all central banks in terms of the severity of the situation in japan , \" said kathy lien , director of currency research at gft in new york .     japan ' s nikkei share index ended up 2.7 percent , recouping some of the week ' s stinging losses . it lost 10.2 percent for the week , wiping $ 350 billion off market capitalization .     the plight of the homeless worsened following a cold snap that brought heavy snow to the worst-affected areas .     nearly 290,000 households in the north were still without electricity , officials said , and the government said about 940,000 households lacked running water .     aid groups say most victims are getting help , but there are pockets of acute suffering .     \" we ' ve seen children suffering with the cold , and lacking really basic items like food and clean water , \" stephen mcdonald of save the children said in a statement on friday .

( scroll down for live updates )     three reactors have had at least partial meltdowns , but an even greater danger has emerged . japanese and u.s. concerns were increasingly focusing on the pools used to store spent nuclear fuel : some of the pools are dry or nearly empty and the rods could heat up and spew radiation .     it could take days and \" possibly weeks \" to get the complex under control , u.s. nuclear regulatory commission chairman gregory jazcko said . he defended the u.s. decision to recommend a 50-mile evacuation zone for its citizens , a much stronger measure than japan has taken .     a senior official with the u.n. ' s nuclear safety agency said there had been \" no significant worsening \" at the fukushima dai-ichi nuclear plant but that the situation remained \" very serious . \" graham andrew told reporters in vienna that nuclear fuel rods in two reactors were only about half covered with water , and in a third they were also not completely submerged .     if the fuel is not fully covered , rising temperatures and pressure will increase the chances of complete meltdowns that would release much larger amounts of radioactive material than the failing plant has emitted so far .     low levels of radiation have been detected well beyond tokyo , which is 140 miles ( 220 kilometers ) south of the plant , but hazardous levels have been limited to the plant itself . still , the crisis triggered by last week ' s earthquake and tsunami has forced thousands to evacuate and drained tokyo ' s normally vibrant streets of life , its residents either leaving town or holing up in their homes .     president barack obama appeared on television to assure americans that officials do not expect harmful amounts of radiation to reach the u.s. or its territories . he also said the u.s. was offering japan any help it could provide , and said he was asking for a comprehensive review of u.s. nuclear plant safety .     japanese and american assessments of the crisis have differed , with the plant ' s owner denying jazcko ' s report wednesday that unit 4 ' s spent fuel pool was dry and that anyone who gets close to the plant could face potentially lethal doses of radiation . but a tokyo electric power co. executive moved closer to the u.s. position thursday .     \" considering the amount of radiation released in the area , the fuel rods are more likely to be exposed than to be covered , \" yuichi sato said .     workers have been dumping seawater when possible to control temperatures at the plant since the quake and tsunami knocked out power to its cooling systems , but they tried even more desperate measures on unit 3 ' s reactor and cooling pool .     two japanese military ch-47 chinook helicopters began dumping seawater on unit 3 on thursday morning , defense ministry spokeswoman kazumi toyama said . the choppers doused the reactor with at least four loads of water in just the first 10 minutes , though television footage showed much of it appearing to disperse in the wind .     chopper crews flew missions of about 40 minutes each to limit their radiation exposure , passing over the reactor with loads of about 2,000 gallons ( 7,500 liters ) of water . another 9,000 gallons ( 35,000 liters ) of water were blasted from military trucks with high-pressure sprayers used to extinguish fires at plane crashes , though the vehicles had to stay safely back from areas deemed to have too much radiation .     special police units with water cannons were also tried , but they could not reach the targets from safe distances and had to pull back , said yasuhiro hashimoto , a spokesman for japan ' s nuclear safety agency .     unit 3 ' s reactor uses a fuel that combines plutonium , better known as an ingredient in nuclear weapons , and reprocessed uranium . the presence of this mixed oxide fuel , or mox , means potentially that two very harmful radioactive products could be released into the environment .     tokyo electric power said it believed workers were making headway in staving off a catastrophe both with the spraying and , especially , with efforts to complete an emergency power line to restart the plant ' s own electric cooling systems .     \" this is a first step toward recovery , \" said teruaki kobayashi , a facilities management official at the power company . he said radiation levels \" have somewhat stabilized at their lows \" and that some of the spraying had reached its target , with one reactor emitting steam .     \" we are doing all we can as we pray for the situation to improve , \" kobayashi said . authorities planned to spray again friday , and kobayashi said : \" choices are limited . we just have to stick to what we can do most quickly and efficiently . \"     work on connecting the new power line to the plant was expected to begin friday and take 10 to 15 hours , said nuclear safety agency spokesman minoru ohgoda . but the utility is not sure the cooling systems will still function . if they don ' t , electricity won ' t help .     four of the plant ' s six reactors have seen fires , explosions , damage to the structures housing reactor cores , partial meltdowns or rising temperatures . officials also recently said temperatures are rising even in the spent fuel pools of the other two reactors .     the troubles at the nuclear complex were set in motion by last friday ' s 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami , which knocked out power and destroyed backup generators needed for the reactors ' cooling systems . that added a nuclear crisis on top of twin natural disasters that likely killed well more than 10,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless .     mario v. bonaca , a physicist sits on an advisory committee to the u.s. nuclear regulatory commission , said he believes the focus of the effort has shifted to the spent fuel pools . \" i understand that they ' ve controlled the cooling of the cores , \" said bonaca , who said he was basing his understanding on nrc and industry sources .     the storage pools need a constant source of cooling water . even when removed from reactors , uranium rods are still extremely hot and must be cooled for months , possibly longer , to prevent them from heating up again and emitting radioactivity .     while a core team of 180 emergency workers has been rotating in and out of the complex to avoid exposure , experts said that anyone working close to the reactors was almost certainly being exposed to radiation levels that could , at least , give them much higher cancer risks .     experts note , though , that radiation levels drop quickly with distance from the complex . while elevated radiation has been detected well outside the evacuation zone , experts say those levels are not dangerous .     u.s. officials were taking no chances . in washington , the state department warned u.s. citizens to consider leaving the country and offered voluntary evacuation to family members and dependents of u.s. personnel in the cities of tokyo , yokohama and nagoya .     the first flight left thursday , with fewer than 100 people onboard , undersecretary of state patrick kennedy said . plans also call for airlifting several thousand family members of u.s. armed forces personnel as well as nonessential staff stationed in japan in the coming days .     the u.s. evacuation zone is far bigger than that established by japan , which has called for a 12-mile zone and has told those within 20 miles to stay indoors . daniel b. poneman , u.s. deputy secretary of energy , said at the briefing that his agency agreed with the 50-mile zone - but said japan ' s measures were also prudent .     nearly a week after the earthquake and tsunami , police said more than 452,000 people were staying in schools and other shelters , as supplies of fuel , medicine and other necessities ran short . both victims and aid workers appealed for more help , as the chances of finding more survivors dwindled .     noriko sawaki lives in a battered neighborhood in sendai that is still without running water and food or gasoline supplies and that , she said , makes life exhausting . \" it ' s frustrating , because we don ' t have a goal , something to strive for . this just keeps on going , \" said the 48-year-old .     in the town of kesennuma , people lined up to get into a supermarket after a delivery of key supplies , such as instant rice packets and diapers .     each person was only allowed to buy 10 items , nhk television reported .     with diapers hard to find in many areas , an nhk program broadcast a how-to session on fashioning a diaper from a plastic shopping bag and a towel .\n"}, {"url": "file://test/28/1/1", "title": "test/28/1/1", "content": "camden , n.j. \u2013 a knoxville , tennessee , man was sentenced

 it says the manager of the new lisbon post office in rural pemberton township failed to return a machine that printed money orders when the postal service introduced new technology in february 2013.     the postmaster , who was transferred to another office in june 2013 , also neglected to destroy about 180 loose money orders that could be printed with the outdated machine , the affidavit says .     saunders began working more than a year later at the pemberton office , where the printing machine \u2014 too big for the postmaster \u2019 s safe \u2014 had been stored in a cabinet , according to

. and while a month off the booze sounds like a seductive way to make up for all that hard-drinking festive excess , it \u2019 s actually a terrible idea , rooted in guilt rather than science . and for some people who actually have a real problem with alcohol , successfully completing a \" sober january \" can give the dangerous illusion that they don \u2019 t have a problem .     i should know . i was one of them . i speak not only as a veteran of many a sober january , but also as someone who was finally forced to admit that yes , they were an alcoholic , and had to stop drinking entirely . i have not had a drink for several years now . i don \u2019 t say this to boast , merely to put in context what follows .     i remember one hungover december morning telling a colleague at the magazine where i was working at the time that i was planning to stay off the drink for a month in the new year .     \u201cwhy on earth would you do that ? \u201d he replied . \u201ca few drinks are the only thing that get you through january , it \u2019 s so bloody miserable. \u201d     he wasn \u2019 t an addict , so he didn \u2019 t understand the allure of a sober january to someone who was \u2013 that the idea of getting obliterated over christmas and new year and then \" white-knuckling \" it for a month before picking up where you left off is deeply appealing to the classic all-or-nothing , getting-away-with-it mentality of the addict .     i managed several sober januarys and they became an important weapon in my armoury of denial . me , an alcoholic ? hardly ! how could i manage to stay off drink for a month if i was ?     i find it particularly depressing that this year , the idea of a dry january is being promoted by the uk \u2019 s biggest alcohol charity , the always well-intentioned alcohol concern . although the charity is careful to state in small print at the bottom of its webpage that the challenge should \" not be attempted by people with an alcohol dependency problem \" unfortunately those are exactly the kind of people a promotion like this will attract . year after year , the only mates that i could persuade to do a sober january with me were the ones who were as bad as or worse than me . the normals , like my co-worker , were never interested . why would they be ?     if you are worried about the amount you have been drinking , the answer is not to swear off drink for a month . the answer is to try and establish whether you do really have a problem . and the best way to do that , ironically enough , is to do some drinking .     this was the course of action recommended by bill wilson , the co-founder of the self-help movement alcoholics anonymous . wilson believed that alcoholics suffer a kind of allergic reaction to alcohol , and that once they start drinking they develop an overwhelming craving for more . this craving , he thought , is only made worse by subsequent attempts to satisfy it with more drink , like an itch that gets worse the more you scratch it .     wilson \u2019 s alcoholism test is remarkably simple , and does not involve any boxes to tick or medical examinations or liver function tests ; it just requires a modicum of honesty .     \u201cwe do not like to pronounce any individual as alcoholic , but you can quickly diagnose yourself , \u201d he wrote . \u201cstep over to the nearest barroom and try some controlled drinking . try to drink and stop abruptly . try more than once . it will not take long for you to decide , if you are honest with yourself about it. \u201d     so - unless your sole aim is to save cash - don ' t challenge yourself to a sober january . anyone can do that . try having a pint every night \u2013 but just one \u2013 if you really want to prove you don \u2019 t have a problem .     as my friend said all those years ago , january sucks - just look at the weather outside - and you normals should have all the help you can to get through it .\n"},
