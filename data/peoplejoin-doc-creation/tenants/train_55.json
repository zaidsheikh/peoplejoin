dead \" hearts into patients at sydney ' s st vincent ' s hospital .     the procedure , using hearts that had stopped beating , has been described as a \" paradigm shift \" that will herald a major increase in the pool of hearts available for transplantation .     it ' s predicted the breakthrough will save the lives of 30 per cent more heart transplant patients .     until now , transplant units have relied solely on still-beating donor hearts from brain-dead patients .     advertisement     but the team at st vincent ' s hospital heart lung transplant unit announced on friday they had transplanted three heart failure patients using donor hearts that had stopped beating for 20 minutes .     two of them have recovered well , while the third , who recently undertook the procedure , is still in intensive care .     cardiologist prof peter macdonald said the donor hearts were housed in a portable console coined a \" heart in a box \" .     here they were submerged in a ground breaking preservation solution jointly developed by the hospital and the victor chang cardiac research institute .     the hearts were then connected to a sterile circuit where they were kept beating and warm .     cardiothoracic surgeon assoc prof kumud dhital , who performed the transplants with hearts donated after circulatory death ( dcd ) , said he \" kicked the air \" when the first surgery was successful .     it was possible thanks to new technology , he said .     \" the incredible development of the preservation solution with this technology of being able to preserve the heart , resuscitate it and to assess the function of the heart has made this possible , \" he told a press conference on friday .     the first patient to have the surgery done was michelle gribilas .     the 57-year-old sydney woman was suffering from congenital heart failure and had surgery about two months ago .     \" i was very sick before i had it , \" she said .     \" now i ' m a different person altogether .     \" i feel like i ' m 40 years old . i ' m very lucky . \"     the second patient , jan damen , 43 , also suffered from congenital heart failure and had surgery about a fortnight ago .

might not be here , \" he said .     \" i ' m not religious or spiritual but it ' s a wild thing to get your head around . \"     prof macdonald , the director of the hospital ' s heart lung transplant unit , said the team had been working on this project for 20 years and intensively for the past four .     \" we ' ve been researching to see how long the heart can sustain this period in which it has stopped beating , \" he said .     \" we then developed a technique for reactivating the heart in a so-called heart in a box machine .     \" to do that we removed blood from the donor to prime the machine and then we take the heart out , connect it to the machine , warm it up and then it starts to beat . \"     the donor hearts were each housed in this machine for about four hours before transplantation , he said .     \" based on the performance of the heart on the machine we can then tell quite reliably whether this heart will work if we then go and transplant it .     \" in many respects this breakthrough represents a major inroad to reducing the shortage of donor organs , \" he said .\n"}], "farshid": [], "parker": [], "eden": [], "dewei": [], "hannah": []},
