the other remained in a hospital not far from the festival , according to a statement by lafourche parish sheriff craig webre .     others who spent the night in tents on festival grounds were shaken by how hard the storm hit and described winds , rain , thunder and lightning so ferocious that people on opposite ends of the same small tent couldn \u2019 t hear each other even if they shouted .     after receiving a call about the injuries shortly after 10 p.m. friday , lafourche parish sheriff \u2019 s office deputies , volunteer firefighters and paramedics went to the scene and found stavis

death was available for stavis .     however , national weather service alerts note that 10 percent of lightning strikes can result in death , often from cardiac arrest or irreversible brain damage . though the chance of being hit by lightning in a given year is less than 1 in 1 million , it does happen regularly . over the past 30 years , the united states has averaged 49 reported lightning fatalities each year .     the low-key , three-day t-bois event calls itself a blues festival , though it also features other types of music . it offers home-cooked cajun food , catfish , crawfish , beer and camping for all ticket-holders and is held on an alligator and crawfish farm owned for more than a century by the family of festival producer \u201calligator mike \u201d falgout , who modeled the festival after large crawfish boils hosted by his family .     falgout did not return messages left about the incident .     new orleanians who have attended t-bois describe it as a relaxed event run largely by local volunteers . two small stages mostly feature acts who play some variation on the blues ; it is closed out each year by new orleans guitarist anders osborne .     children and families often mill through the grounds , and many people camp there overnight . the capacity is limited to 1,200 , and motorized vehicles are prohibited .     an area of the site , the burning village , is reserved as an arts village modeled after burning man . each year , participants like stavis create special , often large-scale art , including a giant sculpture that is burned during the last night of the festival in a controlled fire watched by local firefighters . this year \u2019 s sculpture was of a 30-foot alligator wielding a guitar .     stavis \u2019 brother , erick yingling ,

mainstream media stories and invitations to appear on cnbc .     here \u2019 s how it happened .     observer : what was your first contact with the new york magazine reporter ?     mohammed islam : my friend \u2019 s father worked at new york magazine and he had the reporter contact me . then she [ jessica pressler ] called me .     you seem to be quoted saying \u201ceight figures. \u201d that \u2019 s not true , is it ?     no , it is not true .     is there any figure ? have you invested and made returns at all ?     no .     so it \u2019 s total fiction ?     yes .     are you interested in investing ? how did you get this reputation ?     i run an investment club at stuy high which does only simulated trades .     if you had been playing with real money , would you have done really well ?     the simulated trades percentage was extremely high relative to the s&p .     where did jessica pressler come up with the $ 72 million figure ?     i honestly don \u2019 t know . the number \u2019 s a rumor .     she said \u201chave you made $ 72 million ? \u201d     [ i led her to believe ] i had made even more than $ 72 million on the simulated trades .     at this point the pr reps jumped in with law &amp; order-style objections . a conference outside the room ensued . back into the room came mr. islam .     all i can say is for the simulated trades , i was very successful . the returns were incredible and outperformed the s&p .     damir , tell me where you fit into this .     damir tulemaganbetov : well , i got excited by this whole trading thing and i said hey , let me get on board . i heard about this article coming out and mohammed invited me and i met jessica .     but you guys are pals outside of this ?     we go to social gatherings and friends \u2019 places .     are you into stock-picking as well ?     i haven \u2019 t been into it but i \u2019 m interested .     mohammed , you \u2019 re from queens and you go to this elite public high school . is this a

they \u2019 re reading that you \u2019 ve got $ 72 million ?     mohammed islam : honestly , my dad wanted to disown me . my mom basically said she \u2019 d never talk to me . their morals are that if i lie about it and don \u2019 t own up to it then they can no longer trust me . \u2026 they knew it was false and they basically wanted to kill me and i haven \u2019 t spoken to them since .     you

( \u201caren \u2019 t you the kid who made all that money ? \u201d a teacher asked him. ) so he \u201creconnected \u201d with kids from his old school , allen-stevenson . one of them introduced him to patrick , an aspiring financier , who introduced him to damir at a poker game attended by kids whose parents are , according to damir , \u201cthe one percent of the one percent. \u201d     the son of a kazakh oligarch , damir is tall , slim , and cocky , like a cigarette wearing a fedora . \u201ci call the poker game \u2018destiny , ' \" he said . the waitress arrived with a plate . \u201chere , have some caviar. \u201d     over late nights out and dinners at morimoto , the three hatched a plan to start a hedge fund . \u201cthere are a lot of steps we have to follow through , \u201d said patrick , calling to mind a more serious chuck bass . \u201cbut we \u2019 re on the right track. \u201d they plan to launch in june , after mo turns 18 and can get his broker-dealer license . \u201cmo \u2019 s our maestro , \u201d patrick said . \u201che \u2019 s going to be earning the big bucks . we \u2019 re just going to try to fill his needs. \u201d     all three plan to attend college next year , but they \u2019 re not concerned about classes getting in the way of their goal : \u201ca billion dollars ! \u201d damir said . \u201cby next year ! \u201d mo affirmed the number with a nod . \u201cbut it \u2019 s not just about money , \u201d he added . \u201cwe want to create a brotherhood . like , all of us who are connected , who are in something together , who have influence , like the koch brothers \u2026 \u201d     \u201clike in wolf of wall street ! \u201d damir interjected . \u201cand mo is jordan belfort. \u201d     \u201cno , but , not like that , \u201d patrick said , blanching slightly .     like belfort , mo started with penny stocks . a cousin showed him how to trade . he loved the feeling of risk \u2014 the way his hand shook making the trade \u2014 but he swore it off after losing a chunk of the money he \u2019 d made tutoring . \u201ci didn \u2019 t have the balls for it , \u201d he said . he was 9.     it was a while before he was ready to try again . in the meantime , he became a scholar of modern finance , studying up on hedge-fund managers . he was particularly enamored of paul tudor jones . \u201ci had been paralyzed by my loss , \u201d mo said . \u201cbut he was able to go back to it , even after losing thousands of dollars over and over . paul tudor jones says , \u2018you learn more from your losses than from your gains. \u2019 \u201d mo got into trading oil and gold , and his bank account grew . though he is shy about the $ 72 million number , he confirmed his net worth is in the \u201chigh eight figures. \u201d more than enough to rent an apartment in manhattan \u2014 though his parents won \u2019 t let him live in it until he turns 18 \u2014 and acquire a bmw , which he can \u2019 t drive because he doesn \u2019 t yet have a license . thus , it falls to his father to drive him past tudor jones \u2019 s greenwich house for inspiration . \u201cit \u2019 s because he is who he is that made me who i am today , \u201d mo said .     which is to say : a believer in wall street . \u201ca lot of young people do start-ups , but i think it \u2019 s a bubble . trading and investments will always be there . money will always be rotating \u2014 \u201d     \u201cmoney never sleeps ! \u201d damir added . \u201cthat \u2019 s from the wall street movie. \u201d     \u201cit all comes down to this , \u201d mo continued . \u201cwhat makes the world go round ? money . if money is not flowing , if businesses don \u2019 t keep going , there \u2019 s no innovation , no products , no investments , no growth , no jobs. \u201d     the check arrived for the caviar and apple juice . it totaled $ 400 .     \u201cnew york , that \u2019 s where the money \u2019 s at , \u201d damir shouted , pulling out a credit card .     this reminded me of an old joke about robbing banks because that \u2019 s where the money is . damir grinned . \u201cmy father has a quote , \u201d he said . \u201cit \u2019 s really dope : \u2018you can rob a bank with a gun , but you can rob the whole world with a bank. \u2019 \u201d     patrick buried his face in his hands . \u201cat the end of the day , \u201d he said , \u201cwe \u2019 re young kids. \u201d\n"}]}, "user_id_to_descriptions": {"alice": "Is interested in compiling a summary.", "eden": "Knows about the following topics:\nvegan, newborn, dehydrated, hospital, child neglect\nvegan mother, custody, newborn son, weight loss, Seminole County\nT-Bois Blues Fest, Facebook\nlightning strike, Larose music festival, Jacqui Stavis, death, injury\nlightning strike, Jacqui Stavis, T-Bois Blues Festival, New Orleans, death\nlightning strike, death, electric shock injuries, labrador\nMohammed Islam, stock market, Stuyvesant High School, New York Magazine, Ronn Torossian\nMohammed Islam, New York Magazine, stock market, high school student, fake\nMohammed Islam, stock market, high school, New York, trading"}, "user_id_to_table_names": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_templated": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_lowprecision": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_lowprecision_templated": {}}
