\" instead of doing the right thing and making an anonymous call to 911 or leaving because there was a dead person there , they decided to take the body , bring it back to their place , wrap it in a tent and cover it with hay , \" troyer said .         the men then went back into her home and began the process of cleaning her out .         \" they took her antiques , her vehicles and put them in their name and sold them , \" troyer said . \" then took her identity and her bank cards and tried to steal her money as well . \"         it was eagle-eye security officials at the boeing employees

searched the men ' s home with cadaver dogs and they were able to locate the woman ' s body . an autopsy was conducted on the woman , which showed she probably died of natural causes .         \" we

across-the-board tax cuts .     denver -- mitt romney today attempted to shift focus to what he called president barack obama ' s lack of leadership in the middle east , as world leaders began to gather in new york city for the opening of the united nations general assembly .     the romney campaign this afternoon offered a series of interviews with major u.s. tv networks , in which romney hammered obama for referring to a series of flare-ups in the middle east as \" bumps in the road . \"     in colorado , mitt romney insisted to nbc news that he ' ll win . the obama campaign , meanwhile , has unveiled a new tv ad tying romney ' s tax returns with his comments about the 47 percent . nbc ' s chuck todd reports .     \" when the president was speaking about ' bumps in the road ' he was talking about the developments in the middle east , and that includes an assassination . it includes a muslim brotherhood individual becoming president of egypt . it includes syria being in tumult , \" romney told nbc ' s peter alexander . \" it includes iran being on the cusp of nuclear capability . it includes pakistan being in commotion . \"     mitt romney will stump in colorado on monday and then travel to ohio via bus tour all ahead of next week ' s first debate . the daily rundown ' s chuck todd reports .     romney continued , \" there are extraordinary events going on in the middle east , and considering those events , either one of them or all of them collectively , as bumps in the road shows a person who has a very different perspective about world affairs than the perspective i have . i think this is a time for america to exert leadership and this is not something that we are doing in the middle east ... . \"     romney was referring to an answer obama gave in an interview which aired last night on cbs news ' \" 60 minutes , \" in which the president defended his support for emerging governments in the middle east as a result of the arab spring .     charles dharapak / ap republican presidential candidate , former massachusetts gov . mitt romney boards his plane in denver , monday , sept. 24 , 2012.     kroft : have the events that took place in the middle east , the recent events in the middle east given you any pause about your support for the governments that have come to power following the arab spring ?     obama : well , i ' d said even at the time that this is going to be a rocky path . the question presumes that somehow we could have stopped this wave of change . i think it was absolutely the right thing for us to do to align ourselves with democracy , universal rights , a notion that people have to be able to participate in their own governance . but i was pretty certain and continue to be pretty certain that there are going to be bumps in the road because , you know , in a lot of these places , the one organizing principle has been islam . the one part of society that hasn ' t been controlled completely by the government . there are strains of extremism , and anti-americanism , and anti-western sentiment . and , you know , can be tapped into by demagogues . there will probably be some times where we bump up against some of these countries and have strong disagreements , but i do think that over the long term we are more likely to get a middle east and north africa that is more peaceful , more prosperous and more aligned with our interests .     the romney campaign seized on those comments -- in an attempt to chip away at the president ' s approval rating on foreign affairs , which slid in the last nbc news/wall street journal poll to 49 percent .     ( however , a series of nbc/wsj/marist polls in the battleground states of colorado , iowa , and wisconsin show obama enjoying a double-digit lead over romney when it comes to who would better handle foreign policy. )     nbc ' s peter alexander spoke with republican presidential candidate mitt romney in denver about the upcoming debates , world affairs , and if it is possible to change the tone in washington .     the obama white house fired back on romney , arguing that it was \" offensive \" to suggest that the president was minimizing the deaths of four americans in libya , including the u.s. ambassador there .     \" that assertion is both desperate and offensive , \" white house press secretary jay carney said . \" the president was referring to the transformations in the region , to this process that has -- only began less than two years ago , as we saw in tunisia , and continues to this day , with remarkable transformations occurring in countries around the region . \"     also in the interview , nbc ' s alexander pressed romney on the current polling that shows him trailing obama .     romney remained defiant .     \" i ' m very pleased with the fact that we have a campaign that is taking our message to the people across america , and look --- we ' re gonna win , \" romney said . \" there is no question in my mind . we ' re gonna win . \"     nbc ' s jordan
