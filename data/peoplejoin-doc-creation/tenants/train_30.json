"train/30/1/0", "content": "despite its title , \" elysium \" is no promised land .     expectations were high that the film starring matt damon would carry the flag for thoughtful , big-budget films that care about more than profits . but it has ended up as something of a disappointment , an epic that has gone over to the dark side without realizing it .     that anticipation came courtesy of \" district 9 \" \u2014 the 2009 science fiction film by neill blomkamp , \" elysium ' s \" south african writer-director \u2014 which came out of nowhere to be nominated for four oscars , including best picture and adapted screenplay .     photos : hollywood backlot moments     \" district 9 \" succeeded in part because of the strength of its unexpected core idea : that aliens coming to earth were not necessarily a dominant species but instead were rounded up and segregated in their own parts of town the way blacks had been in south africa .     \" elysium \" makes a similar attempt to graft socio-political concerns onto a sci-fi framework , but the idea is less electric here and the combining of genre and theme not as adroitly done .     initially , however , things do seem promising in \" elysium , \" in large part because of how its subject matter is compellingly visualized on screen ( philip ivey is the production designer ) .     photos : celebrities by the times     the year is 2154 , and earth , thanks to the destructive effects of pollution , overpopulation and related ills , is in horrific shape . blighted , devastated slums cover the planet , and they are home to the poorest people ( a mexico city garbage dump stands in for los angeles ) .     anyone of wealth and status now lives on elysium , a circular space station whose shape is reminiscent of the much smaller one in stanley kubrick ' s \" 2001 . \" the air is pure , robots do the work , and everywhere there are healing machines that cure what ails you . think of a flesh-and-blood version of the disparities in disney ' s \" wall-e \" and you ' ll get the general idea .     making the best of things on the planet is max , played by a bulked-up , head-shaved , tattooed damon . max is a former car thief , once a legend in his los angeles neighborhood , who is working on a factory assembly line hoping to better his lot and maybe even get to elysium someday .     photos : summer sneaks 2013     clearly , social inequality is very much on blomkamp ' s mind , and when you add in illegal , clandestine space flights from earth to elysium by people desperate for medical attention , it ' s clear that hot-button issues like illegal immigration and universal access to healthcare are on the table as well .     this is all well and good , but , paradoxically , once the actual plot of \" elysium \" kicks in , these issues fade from the film ' s consciousness and the traditional , less involving tropes of good-guy-versus-bad-guy action take center stage . although the pulp energy that blomkamp brings to this material makes it consistently watchable , the film doesn ' t feel as singular as we would have hoped .     max , given a hard time by the humorless droids who police earth , has to go to the local hospital where he gets reacquainted with nurse frey ( alice braga ) , his childhood soul mate from , no kidding , the orphanage where they both grew up .     back at the plant where max works , things get worse . our hero is put in a dangerous situation and ends up with a lethal dose of radiation that will kill him in five days . his only hope is to somehow get to elysium and make use of one of those miraculous cure-all machines .     photos : billion-dollar movie club     not averse to helping max are his neighborhood pal julio ( mexico ' s diego luna ) and spider ( brazil ' s wagner moura ) , who runs illegal shuttles to elysium . but the price is steep : max , fortified by an exoskeleton that gives him added strength , will have to capture one of elysium ' s top dogs , evil plutocrat john carlyle ( william fichtner ) and download information from the man ' s brain , a situation riskier than anyone imagines . and more pedestrian .     for one thing , the villains in \" elysium \" are very conventional . aside from carlyle , jodie foster \u2014 displaying excellent french and a stern visage \u2014 is one-dimensional as the armani-clad dragon lady villainess determined to protect elysium no matter the cost . kruger , her thuggish enforcer ( \" district 9 \" star sharlto copley ) is even more of a clich\u00e9 .     countering all this is damon , who is a big plus as always , instinctively humanizing thankless roles like max and making them look easy .     but once max faces off with kruger and his gang , as they inevitably must , all thoughts of anything besides hand-to-hand combat fade into insignificance . the plot gets unnecessarily confusing , and violent images , including a particularly grotesque blown-away face , push everything else away . \" elysium \" may think it is about issues , but at times like these , that ' s very hard to see .     kenneth.turan@latimes.com     ' elysium '     mpaa rating : r , for strong bloody violence
