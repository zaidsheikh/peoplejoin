( note : bernard madoff is serving 150 years ) . the prosecutor told judge hitner , \u201c230 years will not get anyone their money back but on sleepless nights they will know that he got the maximum. \u201d i think 110 years will give them just as much comfort .     during the proceeding , stanford \u2019 s attorney , ali fazel , objected to the use of the term \u201cponzi scheme , \u201d but hittner said the evidence at trial justified it . it \u2019 s not like stanford could be any more insulted . the prosecutors also compared him to bernie madoff . that too caused fazel to speak up on behalf of stanford by saying of madoff , \u201che didn \u2019 t invest time in anything. \u201d not sure what he was going for with that comment but i took it that stanford worked harder at his fraud than did madoff .     speaking on his own behalf , stanford recounted his last three years , including his beating in september 2009. the best that he could say as a compliment for those who prosecuted him was , \u201ci wouldn \u2019 t wish this on them. \u201d while he acknowledged that he felt sorry for depositors , employees and his own family for the failure of stanford financial , he managed to slip in , \u201ci \u2019 m not a thief , \u201d and , \u201ci never defrauded anyone. \u201d victims in the courtroom , all dressed in black , begged to differ . one of the victims , jaime escalona , who represented latin american victims , addressed the court . looking at stanford he said , \u201cyou sir are a dirty , rotten , scoundrel. \u201d the other victim spokesman , angela shaw of the stanford victims coalition , said of stanford , \u201che took our lives as we knew them. \u201d     the prison sentence represents a long fall for the once-knighted antiguan , who has been in prison since his arrest in june 2009. declared indigent by the court , all of stanford \u2019 s assets were frozen and he was represented by a public defender . in march , stanford was found guilty of running a $ 7 billion ponzi scheme . however , his road to the courthouse was not without controversy . first , there was that strange interview on cnbc in which stanford proclaimed his innocence . then stanford sued lloyd \u2019 s of london , the underwriter of stanford financial group \u2019 s directors and officers insurance , to pay for his legal fees . in the end , lloyd \u2019 s won and stanford got the legal help of public defenders ali fazel and robert scardino .     stanford learned that prison can be a difficult place to live . long before being tried in court , stanford was severely beaten by another inmate . he was hospitalized and later transferred to a federal prison medical facility in butner , nc , as result of an addiction to anti-depressants , which he developed after the beating . the trauma , his lawyers claimed , left their client unable to remember anything . after a year \u2019 s delay in heading to trial , government psychologists determined he was faking it and set a court date .     in january , just 12 days before stanford \u2019 s trial was to begin , fazel and scardino wanted out of the case on the grounds that budget restrictions were hurting their ability to defend him . prior to that , a number of supporting groups and expert witnesses for the defense said that they too wanted to quit because they were not being paid by the government . eventually , some money was released and stanford was off to trial .     with all of this drama , there still has been no distribution of the funds that have been seized by the government to victims who had invested their savings with stanford in the hopes of incredible returns on supposedly safe certificates of deposit . the trial and the prison sentence will bring some closure , but the restitution to investors will come up a little short . with regard to the losses for u.s. taxpayers ? we will be paying for stanford \u2019 s prison stay and his future legal fees . stanford is planning to appeal and the court will be giving him a new public defender .     stanford \u2019 s most memorable statement was , \u201cif i live the rest of my life in prison \u2026 . i will always be at peace with the way i conducted myself in business. \u201d he can think about that one for a while .     my thanks to twitterers ronnie crocker and cnbc \u2019 s scott cohn , who gave us all updates

military missions go , this one is unique : relocate desert tortoises inhabiting desert land eyed to train marine corps brigades to safer areas away from human activity and military training .     by the sixth day of a two-week effort , the marine corps was almost halfway through its goal to relocate about 1,100 tortoises in a \u201ctranslocation \u201d program to re-home desert tortoises from its recently-expanded marine corps air ground combat center at twentynine palms , calif. the combat center is the marine corps \u2019 premier training center for desert warfare and houses numerous live-fire , maneuver and urban warfare ranges and operating bases where units train before they are certified to deploy overseas .     but the home of the desert tortoise , which is federally listed as a species \u201cthreatened \u201d with extinction , includes those swaths of the mojave desert .     the relocation plan began april 8 , when 125 biologists fanned out to find the first group of desert tortoise in the expansion areas of mostly federal recreation desert lands west and south of the existing base . they located the tortoises , and each got a full health assessment , including blood work and a physical exam , food and water . the following day , a helicopter piloted by a biologist carried bins bearing tortoises to their new homes in one of five sites within mcagcc or nearby federal lands .     on wednesday , 98 tortoises \u2014 all tagged with transmitters and ranging in age from about six to 60 years \u2013 were taken to their new future homes , or \u201creceiving site , \u201d via a contracted helicopter , officials said .     \u201cthis is the last recovery requirement before we can proceed with full-scale use \u201d of the expansion areas , walter christensen , conservation branch head of the center \u2019 s natural resources and environmental affairs division , told usni news on thursday .     over the past two years , biologists had placed radio transmitters on the shells of tortoises marked for relocation . last year \u2019 s planned relocation was stymied by california \u2019 s extended drought , which shorted the water and growth of plants that provide the tortoise \u2019 s nourishment and lifelines . legal challenges by conservation groups also put the brakes on the marine corps \u2019 airlift plans . those delays had hampered the service \u2019 s initial plans to enable brigade-sized forces to conduct the first large-scale exercise in august 2016.     it \u2019 s no small feat to find new homes for the desert tortoise , whose native region in the mojave is besieged by increasing human activity , development , diseases , commercial and energy uses and recreational off-roaders . then there \u2019 s the threat from predators : ravens , coyotes , even jackrabbits who find the soft underbellies of fledgling juvenile desert tortoises a tasty treat .     yet the tortoise has found kin among marines . for more than a decade , the marine corps has taken point in finding better ways to ensure survivability and viability of the critters .     desert tortoises found to be too small to relocate instead are placed in holding pens at the combat center \u2019 s tortoise research and captive rearing site , christensen said . the site , known as tracrs , covers about six acres and houses large fenced pens where clatches of eggs and juveniles are housed and monitored as part of a long-running study with the university of california . tracrs , considered by some as the tortoise \u2019 s \u201chead start \u201d program , was established in 2006.     the first group of 35 tracrs tortoises was released in october 2015 , but the region \u2019 s drought delayed a planned spring 2016 release . recent rains across california sprouted more native plants across the desert , so , in march , a second group of 50 tortoises were moved from tracrs to new habitats , brian henen , a combat center biologist and resident tortoise expert , told usni news . about 390 tortoises remain in the pens at tracrs , henen said .     the marines \u2019 relocation program had come under legal challenge by conservation groups , some who pointed to failed previous attempts by the department of defense to save tortoises by moving them from military training areas in california , at fort irwin and edwards air force base . the marine corps \u201clearned from past lessons , \u201d christensen said , adding it \u201ctook the time to do it right. \u201d     \u201cpeople feel very strong about the tortoise , \u201d he said . \u201cthe tortoise is very charismatic . we are pretty careful about what we do here. \u201d     the service has funneled money and focus into ways to improve the odds of tortoise survivability , including tracrs and its long-term study and tracking and the relocation program once congress approved the combat center \u2019 s expansion into mostly former federal lands controlled by the u.s. bureau of land management . for the relocation mission , combat center officials followed u.s. fish and wildlife guidance that provided methods to up the odds that the tortoises could persevere against predators and manage in their new environment .     biologists had affixed transmitters to each desert tortoise , which enabled tracking and monitoring and helped identify any social groupings of tortoises that could be moved together . the marine corps will track these tortoises for 30 years , with consistent tracking for the first five to 10 years , henen said , adding , \u201cwe are committed to doing 30 years. \u201d     tortoises were moved from areas in the western expansion area , west of the main combat center , to five areas 15 to 20 kilometers away but within the training base or on blm-controlled lands , all identified as supportable tortoise habitat . \u201cwe are not fencing these areas off , \u201d henen said . a smaller number , about 85 , will be moved from the combat center \u2019 s southern expansion area in the upcoming week . it \u2019 s uncertain whether tortoises would return or venture to lands busy with military activity or remain in their new areas , but by their nature they tend to stay within six miles or so of their location . \u201cthe tortoises are mobile , \u201d christensen said , \u201cbut yes , they are slow. \u201d     that lack of speed makes them vulnerable to coyotes and ravens . ongoing efforts are trying to track and control the raven assaults , official said . those ravens found to target tortoise nests can be removed by fish and wildlife service personnel , christensen said . coyotes , which frequent the combat center , also are targeted by existing base regulations . in recent incidents , christensen said , a marine training in the field was bitten , and several base residents reported attacks on their household pets by coyotes .\n"}], "eden": [{"url": "file://train/32/2/0", "title": "train/32/2/0", "content": "more than 1,000 desert tortoises are taking a trip with the marine corps this month .     the military is using helicopters to relocate the tortoises to another part of the mojave to make way for an expansion of its desert training grounds .     during the two-week-long process , the hubcap-sized tortoises are being loaded into plastic containers , which are then stacked and strapped to a helicopter .     their new home will be swaths of federal land to the north and southeast of the twentynine palms base , marine officials said . the areas were deemed far enough away that the tortoises wouldn \u2019 t migrate back to the original habitat .     the cost of the whole effort , including a 30-year monitoring program to ensure the health of the federally protected species , is $ 50 million .     the marines at the twentynine palms base want to be able to practice large-scale exercises with live fire and combined-arms maneuvering .     the campaign goes back to 2008 , when the corps began studying how to do it without breaking environmental law .     the 2014 national defense authorization act handed land formerly managed by the bureau of land management to the defense department . tortoises living on that land are now being moved .     in march 2016 , the center for biological diversity filed a notice of intent to sue , arguing that the federal government failed to fully examine how the move might harm the tortoises .     however , the move went ahead this month after the u.s. fish and wildlife service told the marine corps that its review wouldn \u2019 t be done before the spring window for the move , marine corps officials said .     it \u2019 s not the first time that the corps has been in the tortoise-moving business .     in 2006 , the twentynine palms base relocated 17 adult tortoises in order to build a training range . marine officials say no tortoises died during three years of post-move monitoring .     this time , marine corps biologists will monitor tortoises intensely for the first five years . then monitoring requirements will diminish over time until the 30-year obligation is met , officials said .     about 235 juveniles too small for relocation are being admitted to the base \u2019 s \u201chead start facility , \u201d where they will remain until they grow large enough to better survive on their own .     caption a

( eric reed/for the press enterprise/scng )     and within minutes , the tortoises were flying toward a safer haven of the recently created mojave trails national monument \u2014 about 25 miles away from the crushing treads of tanks , the boots of soldiers and the blasts of bombs .     operation desert tortoise was in its fifth day . as of wednesday morning , 266 of the animals had been moved out of the johnson valley , about 30 miles northwest of yucca valley .     before the end of the month , the marines , working with about 125 wildlife biologists expect to have moved 1,156 tortoises , with a focus on clearing transportation corridors and other areas expected to be most disturbed by live-ammunition training missions .     it \u2019 s part of a multi-year , $ 50 million-plus tortoise relocation and study program at the base that was ok \u2019 d by the u.s. fish and wildlife service following a 2013 vote by congress to add about 88,000 acres in johnson valley to the combat center .     for the marines , the expansion will allow them to hold longer and more-involved live-ammunition desert training missions to prepare marines to intervene in global hot spots , such as the middle east , should it be necessary . such training is expected to start this summer .     for the tortoise , a species listed as threatened with extinction , it means the loss of more than a hundred square miles of quality habitat , as evidenced this year by robust blooms of yellow desert dandelions and other annual plants that are their primary food source .     the resources of the u.s. defense department were put to work to minimize harm to the tortoises , said brian henen , an ecologist for the marine corps air ground combat center at twentynine palms .     analysis and field work for the move began more than two years ago . scores of specially trained biologists have methodically walked the valley and fitted each tortoise they found with radio transmitters , so the animals could be gathered for this month \u2019 s move . it \u2019 s the largest tortoise move yet in the mojave desert .     the five areas of public land around the base that are receiving the animals were carefully chosen for their quality habitat and their distances from human habitation , henen said .     tortoises that lived near each other are being released in similar proximity in the recipient areas to preserve their social structure .     \u201cwe are moving them in groups . we are trying to sustain the similarity and the structure of their origin , \u201d said henen , standing by a makeshift medical checkup station for the tortoises .     there , peter praschag , a world-renowned tortoise and turtle expert from austria , was working with veterinarian shannon diruzzo to screen tortoises for signs of disease and other health issues .     a large male dubbed mc-2013 appeared frightened by the checkup and voided the water stored in his bladder , called a coelomic cavity . this was a serious matter , because a tortoise may get only one or two chances a year to get a good drink of water .     so praschag used a syringe to carefully refill the animal \u2019 s coelomic cavity with a saline solution of water .     the work of the biologists won \u2019 t be finished until long after the last load of tortoises are flown out this month . henen explained that the biologists will return frequently during the next four years to search for any reptiles that may have been left behind . they expect to move another 300 tortoises during that time .     the plans also include tracking and studying the relocated tortoises , as well as those already in the recipient area , for as long as 30 years . for this research , three groups of 225 tortoises \u2014 relocated ones , those already there and an unaffected control group \u2014 will be fitted with transmitters to track their movements and survival rates .     biologists hope that the knowledge gained from this research will help the species recover .     but the loss of more than 100 square miles of prime habitat is still harmful to the tortoises , which has faced declines since the 1970s , prompting its 1990 listing under the endangered species act , said ileene anderson , a biologist with the tucson-based center for biological diversity .     \u201cit is going to be a big hit on the species , \u201d she said .     she said it is not known if the public property outside the base will have enough food and other resources for both residents and newcomers to survive , and that wildlife biologists don \u2019 t know for sure why tortoises numbers have dropped in those areas .     she \u2019 s also worried that the tortoises may try to find their way back to their birthplaces in the base expansion areas .     but the u.s. fish and wildlife service ( fws ) determined in january that moving the tortoises from the johnson valley won \u2019 t jeopardize the survival of the species .     scott hoffman , who was observing the relocation effort for the fws , said the species may benefit in the long run .     \u201cyes , we are losing habitat . but are we are using the relocated tortoises to
