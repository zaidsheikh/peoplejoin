called friday for a return to negotiations to avert the so-called fiscal cliff , a day after talks cratered in a very public fashion when republicans abandoned house speaker john boehner ' s backup plan .     in truth , talks to secure a big deficit-reduction deal had already broken down monday afternoon in the office of mr. boehner ( r. , ohio ) , a wall street journal reconstruction shows . mr. boehner had been negotiating a deal with the white house to let tax rates rise for upper-income people .     mr. boehner , irritated with the white house , was finding it hard to keep his troops in line as details of his negotiations with mr. obama leaked out . in the speaker ' s office just off the capitol ' s majestic rotunda that afternoon , he told his top lieutenants that he was already thinking about a pared-down backup plan . \" in the absence of an agreement , ' plan b ' is the plan , \" he told his deputies , according to a script he read them that afternoon .     enlarge image

press eric cantor     one by one , they came out in favor of plan b and against the broader deal .     house ways and means chairman dave camp ( r. , mich. ) said the new tax revenue the broader plan called for was too high . then budget chairman paul ryan ( r. , wis. ) , whom mr. boehner had spent weeks wooing , said he couldn ' t sign on because it didn ' t make structural changes in entitlements .     the speaker went ahead with plan b , which collapsed thursday night before he could even bring it to a vote , leaving talks at a perilous standstill just days before the year-end fiscal-cliff deadline . even if an agreement can be reached by then , both sides expect it to be a small package doing little to tackle the long-term budget woes and deferring the battle until next year .     a review of the negotiations , based on interviews with a dozen aides and lawmakers , suggests the problems lay in mr. boehner ' s inability to coax his rank-and-file to support a deal that raises taxes on higher-income americans . another factor was what republicans saw as president obama ' s unwillingness to bend when a deal was in sight , jamming the speaker with a deal his party couldn ' t swallow .     the negotiations offer little evidence november ' s election brought the president and house republicans closer together . if anything , the talks poisoned an already distrustful relationship .     mr. boehner could soon face a decision whether to call for a vote on some sort of plan that could avert the cliff ' s spending cuts and tax increases but might imperil his position if he had to rely on democrats to pass it .     mr. obama repeatedly lost patience with the speaker as negotiations faltered . in an oval office meeting last week , he told mr. boehner that if the sides didn ' t reach agreement , he would use his inaugural address and his state of the union speech to tell the country the republicans were at fault .     falling over the fiscal cliff

offering early concessions , including that the gop would agree to raise new tax revenue . a speech mr. boehner planned to give was rewritten 18 times and included input from top republican leaders .     he and mr. obama didn ' t sit down together for another 10 days . the session began genially . but tension quickly emerged over the president ' s call to include increasing the u.s. ' s borrowing limit in any final package .     responded mr. boehner : \" i ' ve found in my life that everything i ' ve ever wanted has come with price . \"     mr. obama told the speaker he wasn ' t willing to play games with the debt ceiling .     staffs got to work on the outline of a deal . in their first offer , republicans wanted to essentially preserve bush-era rates set to expire dec. 31 while raising some new revenue through a tax overhaul in 2013. the white house made clear it wouldn ' t agree to a plan that didn ' t raise some tax rates immediately .     brett loper , the speaker ' s top policy aide , prodded white house officials to look for tax revenue elsewhere . in phone calls and meetings , he steered them to tax shelters and suggested limiting deductions for tax-exempt municipal bonds .     national economic council director gene sperling told mr. loper it was impossible to hit revenue targets without raising tax rates .     at one point , mr. loper said , \" i ' m asking you for help . are you going to help me or not ?

\" at another point , the speaker noted his gop majority would also return next year .     the white house ' s first formal offer , presented nov. 29 left mr. boehner incredulous . it included a request for $ 1.6 trillion in additional tax revenue over 10 years , a permanent increase in the debt ceiling and money for road projects and other year-end priorities . in return it offered spending cuts of $ 400 billion \u2014 25 cents for each dollar in new revenue .     taking a drag on his cigarette , mr. boehner asked treasury secretary timothy geithner , who had presented the plan , a number of questions but didn ' t fully engage him . across the capitol , senate minority leader mitch mcconnell ( r. , ky ) said he laughed at the offer .     the same sticking points kept rearing up \u2014 the white house insisting on more tax revenue than republicans could stomach , and the republicans demanding deeper cuts than the white house would accept .     during one session in the capitol with white house ' s legislative liaison rob nabors , mr. loper from the boehner camp asked , referring to a near-deal during last year ' s debt-ceiling fight : \" can you get back into the zone of where you were in july 2011 ? \"     \" no , \" mr. nabors replied . \" we were probably overextended then , and there ' s no way we would do it now . \"     mr. nabors said if they couldn ' t reach a deal , they should keep lines of communication alive . the typically serious mr. loper asked , \" so , you ' re breaking up with us ? \"     on dec. 13 , mr. boehner went to the white house at the president ' s request , joking he was going to the woodshed .     the president told him he could choose one of two doors . the first represented a big deal . if mr. boehner chose it , the president said , the country and financial markets would cheer . door no . 2 represented a spike in interest rates and a global recession .     mr. boehner said he wanted a deal along the lines of what the two men had negotiated in the summer of 2011 in a fight over raising the debt ceiling . \" you missed your opportunity on that , \" the president told him .     that night , the speaker and majority leader eric cantor ( r. , va. ) decided to make the biggest concession so far .     as the country the next day digested news of a brutal school shooting in connecticut , mr. boehner called the president and for the first time offered to let tax rates rise \u2014 on income above $ 1 million . the president acknowledged the concession but said mr. boehner ' s plan wasn ' t raising enough revenue .     news broke the next night both about the concession and that the speaker was willing to extend the borrowing limit . on sunday , the white house sent a plane to fly mr. boehner back to washington for a morning appointment with the president on monday , the day it now appears the deal fell apart .     in that session , the president held firm for $ 1.2 trillion in additional tax revenue , a second step down from his original offer . mr. boehner asked for another $ 100 billion in spending cuts but couldn ' t get a commitment .     finally , the speaker said , \" well , you and i can sit here and stare at each other , \" or he could leave and they would talk later .     back in the capitol , mr. boehner told mr. cantor the president wasn ' t moving . they agreed to call him . on the call , mr. boehner restated he needed $ 1 in spending cuts for every $ 1 in revenue raised . he dropped a prior demand to increase the medicare eligibility age .     the president told mr. boehner that he was willing to make some concessions on taxes and spending , but cautioned that they needed to retain democratic votes for the bill to pass .     the speaker raised the prospect of moving a backup bill . white house officials said mr. boehner didn ' t reveal what plan b comprised . administration officials expected a few more days of back-and-forth , but the speaker thought the prospects were dim for a big deal .     meeting with his leadership team in the afternoon , mr. boehner read from a script prepared by his staff , telling lawmakers he still wanted a big deal but the rank and file needed to know the plan by a 9 a.m. conference meeting the next morning , tuesday . he encouraged his colleagues to accept the backup plan .     \" i ' m going to keep the proposal on the table , \" he said of the broader deal . \" as i told the president , i ' m not making an ultimatum . the offer stays on the table , even if we move on plan b . \"     his lieutenants made clear they preferred plan b to the one mr. boehner was trying to broker .     the speaker called the president with news the house would move ahead with the backup bill , which would preserve bush-era rates for all income below $ 1 million . the president was incensed .     as the week progressed , support didn ' t materialize , with some gop members complaining that the bill raised taxes and others that it didn ' t have enough spending cuts . mr. boehner pulled it thursday night and read the serenity prayer to members , whom he then dismissed .     on friday afternoon , the president spoke to both mr. boehner and senate democratic leader harry reid in a bid to resurrect a deal . soon afterward he left the white house for his annual family vacation in hawaii .     write to peter nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com     a version of this article appeared december 22 , 2012 , on page a1 in the u.s. edition of the wall street journal , with the headline : how ' cliff ' talks hit the wall .\n"}, {"url": "file://test/45/2/1", "title": "test/45/2/1", "content": "the juiciest passage in the wall street journal \u2019 s behind-the-scenes report on the fiscal cliff negotiations comes when house speaker john a. boehner ( r-ohio ) asks president obama whether he can have the deal he rejected in 2011 . \u201cyou missed your opportunity on that , \u201d the president replies .     ouch .     but the most important insight into the white house \u2019 s strategic thinking comes when boehner says to the president , \u201d i put $ 800 billion [ in tax revenue ] on the table . what do i get for that ? \u201d obama \u2019 s response is cold and telling . \u201d you get nothing , \u201d the president said . \u201ci get that for free. \u201d     that , right there , is the central fact of negotiations for the democrats and the central problem for the republicans . at the end of this year , more than $ 5 trillion in scheduled tax increases begin . but the white house doesn \u2019 t believe that \u2019 s real revenue . democrats in congress won \u2019 t permit that kind of a tax increase on ordinary americans . the white house won \u2019 t permit that kind of a tax increase on ordinary americans .     but they \u2019 re certain they can hold onto almost $ 800 billion of it . the senate already passed a bill letting the bush tax cuts lapse for income over $ 250,000 . that bill is very , very popular . the white house expects that if we go over the cliff , the house will have to pass that bill , too , and the president would have little choice but to sign it . that bill raises taxes by a bit more than $ 700 billion , which is less than the $ 1.6 trillion the white house wants . but that $ 700 billion , to the white house , is the baseline : if they get nothing else , they will certainly get that .     and that \u2019 s why boehner \u2019 s offer of $ 800 billion doesn \u2019 t impress . the white house already has some $ 700 billion in the bank , as they see it . the reason to negotiate with boehner is that an agreement with him could , in theory , push that number well above $ 1 trillion while stabilizing the debt and avoiding the economic pain of falling off the fiscal cliff . but there \u2019 s no reason to cut a deal with boehner in which the white house gives up spending cuts in order to get a tax increase they can have anyway .     the talk in washington now is about a \u201csmall deal. \u201d that would likely include the senate tax bill , some policy to turn off at least the defense side of the sequester and a handful of other policies to blunt or delay various parts of the fiscal cliff .     that \u2019 s not a very good deal for the short-term health of the economy . depending on how much of the fiscal cliff gets delayed , we could tip into recession anyway . but it could lead , in the end , to much more revenue than a \u201cbig deal \u201d now .     here \u2019 s how it would go . some time in the next month or so , the small deal would pass and the white house would pocket that $ 700-plus billion in tax revenue . they really would get that for free , just as the president told boehner .     but pressure would quickly mount to strike a larger deal , both because there would be another fiscal cliff coming and because the debt ceiling would need to be raised . ( the white house swears they won \u2019 t negotiate over the debt ceiling , but it \u2019 s not exactly clear what that will mean in practice. )     the white house would insist that the next deal includes a 1 : 1 ratio of tax increases \u2014 all of which could come through republican-friendly tax reform \u2014 to spending cuts . so a subsequent deal that included $ 600 billion or $ 700 billion in spending cuts would also include $ 600 billion or $ 700 billion in tax increases , leading to total new revenue in the range of $ 1.2 trillion to $ 1.4 trillion .     there \u2019 s precedent for this . after the 2010 midterms , republicans forced the passage of the budget control act , which included more than a trillion dollars in spending cuts and no offsetting tax increases . they \u2019 ve subsequently refused to count those cuts toward any future deals . if the president , after winning the 2012 election , pocketed $ 700 billion in tax increases and insisted that revenue was unrelated to the next negotiation , he \u2019 d simply be following boehner \u2019 s lead .     all of which is to say , if boehner had taken the white house \u2019 s deal in 2011 , he could \u2019 ve stopped the tax increase at $ 800 billion . if he took their most recent deal , he could stop it at $ 1.2 trillion . but if he insists on adding another round to the negotiations \u2014 one that will likely come after the white house pockets $ 700 billion in tax increases \u2014 then any deal in which gets the entitlement cuts he wants is going to mean a deal in which he accepts even more tax increases than the white house is currently demanding .     today , boehner wishes he \u2019 d taken the deal the president offered him in 2011. a year from now , he might wish he \u2019 d taken the deal the president offered him in 2012 .\n"}, {"url": "file://test/45/2/2", "title": "test/45/2/2", "content": "9 days to cliff , 30 days to inauguration -- obama to boehner : ' i get that

( photo : andrew nelles / the tennessean ) buy photo story highlights confederate memorial hall opened 1935 with support from united daughters of the confederacy .     vanderbilt first sought to change the name in 2002.     starting in 2005 , the university began referring to the building as memorial hall .     to change the name , vanderbilt raised $ 1.2 million to repay the united daughters of the confederacy .     vanderbilt university will repay an 83-year-old donation in order to remove from a residence hall what its leader called \" a symbol and a reminder of racism , slavery and a very , very bloody civil war . \"         chancellor nicholas s. zeppos made the announcement monday , capping a 14-year effort to rename confederate memorial hall . the building , which has had that name etched into the stone above its entrance since it opened in 1935 , stands in the heart of the university ' s freshman commons , and has frequently spurred debate about the university ' s attitude toward an increasingly diverse student body .     in an interview with the tennessean , zeppos \u2014 who arrived on campus as a law professor in 1987 \u2014 said he had long been in favor of changing the building ' s name .     \" it ' s a symbol that is , for many people , deeply offensive and painful , \" zeppos said in the interview . \" and to walk past it or to have to live in that space is really something that i just don ' t think is acceptable . \"     the united daughters of the confederacy originally donated $ 50,000 in 1933 toward the building \u2019 s construction and naming rights in order to honor confederate soldiers who died during the civil war .     vanderbilt previously attempted to rename the building memorial hall in 2002 , but the tennessee division of the united daughters of the confederacy sued to keep the original name . a tennessee appeals court ruled in 2005 that vanderbilt could remove \u201cconfederate \u201d from the inscription only after it had returned the donation at its current value .     anonymous donors recently gave the university the $ 1.2 million needed for that purpose ; the vanderbilt board of trust authorized the move this summer .     doug jones , the nashville attorney who represented the daughters of the confederacy against vanderbilt , called the move \" a real slam on the history of our country . \"     \u201call it was was just a simple monument for the boys in tennessee that died \u201d in the civil war , jones said , adding that the name was not connected with slavery . \u201cwe think rewriting history \u2019 s just terrible . and i think it \u2019 s a very sad day for a school with that kind of reputation to be condoning that . \"     universities across the country have faced similar decisions as they re-evaluated the implications of their buildings ' names . students and officials at middle tennessee state university in murfreesboro have spent months pushing to remove the name of nathan bedford forrest , a founder of the ku klux klan , from a campus building . mtsu and the tennessee board of regents approved the change , which now goes before a state panel .     zeppos flatly rebuffed the criticism that changing the name of a residence hall would compromise the university ' s approach to its long and complicated history .     \" we are not saying this is not part of vanderbilt ' s history , \" he said . \" i think we teach history by how we talk about these events .     \" i don ' t think that that ( name ) was really teaching anyone history . \"     the longstanding effort to rename the residence hall took on renewed urgency over the past couple of years , as universities across tennessee and the country grappled with the shadow of racism and slavery on their campuses . at vanderbilt , founded in 1873 just eight years after the civil war ended , the name change follows a series of changes made over the past year to address diversity , including the addition of a chief diversity officer to the university ' s leadership team .     in 2005 , vanderbilt officially began referring to the building as memorial hall , although the word confederate remained on its facade . students , faculty and high-ranking administrators argued passionately to remove the word at a town hall on the subject last fall .     ariana fowler , president of vanderbilt student government , praised the university leadership for the decision to formally rename the residence hall .     \u201cthis action demonstrates the administration ' s attentiveness to student needs and concerns , as well as sets a great precedent for advocating on behalf of those who may feel marginalized on our campus , \u201d fowler said in the university statement . \u201cthis is an excellent next step in the direction of becoming an institution that not only admits diverse students , but ensures their care and support \u2014 one who is eager to eliminate any barriers that may stand in the way of such a goal. \u201d     zeppos said the decision to remove the mention of the confederacy from the building spoke to the courage of students , faculty and staff who spoke out against it for years .     \" i hope that they feel as if they ' ve made a big difference in vanderbilt and in vanderbilt ' s history themselves , \" he said . \" it hopefully says we have listened , we have made changes . but i don ' t think we should assume that our work is completed in any way . \"     crews were already working monday night to cover the name over the building \u2019 s entrance .     reach
