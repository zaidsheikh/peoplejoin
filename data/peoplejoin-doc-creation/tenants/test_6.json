( too late ! ) the crossbow \u2014 a barnett model equipped with a steel-tipped four-blade broadhead arrow \u2014 is perched on the dash between us . it looks like you could shoot through a goddamn mountain with it .     \u201cthat \u2019 ll bury up in you and kill you dead , \u201d phil says .     the bow is cocked and loaded , just in case a deer stumbles in front of us and we need to do a redneck drive-by on the poor bastard , but the safety is on . safety first . still , phil warns me , \u201cyou don \u2019 t want to be bumping that. \u201d     as we drive out into the woods , past a sign that reads parish maintenance ends , phil is telling me all about the land around us and how the animals are a glorious gift from god and how blowing their heads off is part of his plan for us .     \u201clook at this , \u201d he says , gesturing to the surrounding wilderness . \u201cthe almighty gave us this . genesis 9 is where the animals went wild , and god gave them wildness . after the flood , that \u2019 s when he made animals wild . up until that time , everybody was vegetarian . after the flood , he said , \u2018i \u2019 m giving you everything now . animals are wild. \u2019 \u201d     there \u2019 s a fly parked on phil \u2019 s long beard . it \u2019 s been there the whole ride , and i desperately want to pluck it out , but i decide against it . along with the crossbow , there \u2019 s a loaded .22-caliber rifle rattling around in the footwell . and yet , much like the 14 million americans who nielsen says tune in to duck dynasty every week \u2014 over 2 million more than the audience for the breaking bad finale \u2014 i am comfortable here in these woods with phil and his small cache of deadly weaponry . he is welcoming and gracious . he is a man who preaches the gospel of the outdoors and , to my great envy , practices what he preaches . he spends most of his time out here , daydreaming about what he calls a \u201cpristine earth \u201d : a world where nothing gets in the way of nature or the hunters who lovingly maintain it . no cities . no buildings . no highways .     oh , and no sinners , too . so here \u2019 s where things get a bit uncomfortable . phil calls himself a bible-thumper , and holy shit , he thumps that bible hard enough to ring the bell at a county-fair test of strength . if you watch duck dynasty , you can hear plenty of it in the nondenominational supper-table prayer the family recites at the end of every episode , and in the show \u2019 s no-cussing , no-blaspheming tone . but there are more things phil would like to say \u2014 \u201ccontroversial \u201d things , as he puts it to me \u2014 that don \u2019 t make the cut . ( this march , for instance , he told the christian-oriented sports spectrum magazine that he didn \u2019 t approve of a&e editing out \u201cin jesus \u201d from a family prayer scene , even though a&e says that the phrase has been uttered in at least seventeen episodes. )     out here in these woods , without any cameras around , phil is free to say what he wants . maybe a little too free . he \u2019 s got lots of thoughts on modern immorality , and there \u2019 s no stopping them from rushing out . like this one :     \u201cit seems like , to me , a vagina \u2014 as a man \u2014 would be more desirable than a man \u2019 s anus . that \u2019 s just me . i \u2019 m just thinking : there \u2019 s more there ! she \u2019 s got more to offer . i mean , come on , dudes ! you know what i \u2019 m saying ? but hey , sin : it \u2019 s not logical , my man . it \u2019 s just not logical. \u201d     perhaps we \u2019 ll be needing that seat belt after all .     \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7     the duck dynasty origin story is the mighty river from which all other robertson-family stories flow . and it is an awesome story , one that improves the more it is told , so here is my stab at it : phil robertson grew up bone poor in the northwest corner of this state \u2014 a place where cajun redneck culture and ozark redneck culture intersect \u2014 to a manic-depressive mother and a roughneck father . he was a star quarterback in high school and earned a scholarship to play at louisiana tech , but quit after one season because football interfered with duck-hunting season . the guy who took his roster spot at tech was terry bradshaw , because that \u2019 s how these kinds of stories go .     phil on growing up in pre-civil-rights-era louisiana     \u201ci never , with my eyes , saw the mistreatment of any black person . not once . where we lived was all farmers . the blacks worked for the farmers . i hoed cotton with them . i \u2019 m with the blacks , because we \u2019 re white trash . we \u2019 re going across the field .... they \u2019 re singing and happy . i never heard one of them , one black person , say , \u2018i tell you what : these doggone white people \u2019 \u2014 not a word ! ... pre-entitlement , pre-welfare , you say : were they happy ? they were godly ; they were happy ; no one was singing the blues. \u201d     according to phil \u2019 s autobiography \u2014 a ghostwritten book he says he has never read \u2014 he spent his days after tech doing odd jobs and his evenings getting drunk , chasing tail , and swallowing diet pills and black mollies , a form of medicinal speed . in his midtwenties , already married with three sons , a piss-drunk robertson kicked his family out of the house . \u201ci \u2019 m sick of you , \u201d he told his wife , kay . but robertson soon realized the error of his ways , begged kay to come back , and turned over his life to jesus christ .     in 1972 , with jesus at the wheel , robertson founded the duck commander company , which sold a line of custom-made duck-hunting calls that quickly became popular among avid hunters for their uncanny accuracy in replicating the sound of a real duck . he eventually sold half the company to his son willie , now 41 , and together they made a dvd series about the family \u2019 s duck hunts , which led to a show on the outdoor channel , which led to duck dynasty on a&e , which led to everything blowing right the fuck up .     the show \u2014 a reality sitcom showcasing the semiscripted high jinks of phil , his brother \u201cuncle si , \u201d his four sons , alan , willie , jase , and jep , and the perpetually exasperated but always perfectly accessorized robertson-family ladies \u2014 has become the biggest reality-tv hit in the history of cable television , reportedly earning the family a holy shit \u2013 worthy $ 200,000-an-episode paycheck . it \u2019 s a funny , family-friendly show , with \u201cskits that we come up with , \u201d as phil describes the writing process . they plunder beehives . they blow up beaver dams . and when the robertson-family ladies go up to a rooftop in a hydraulic lift , you just know that lift will \u201caccidentally \u201d get stuck and strand them .     but the show , whose fifth season premieres on january 15 , is just one part of the family \u2019 s pop-cultural dominance . in 2013 four books written ( kind of ! ) by robertson family members made the top ten on the new york times nonfiction best-seller list . another book \u2014 penned by jase robertson and detailing his christian rebirth at age 14 , his struggle to forgive his father \u2019 s past behavior , and his young daughter \u2019 s struggle through five facial-reconstruction surgeries to overcome a severe cleft lip and palate \u2014 is forthcoming and destined to make it five best-sellers . there \u2019 s also a book of devotionals somewhere in there , along with duck dynasty \u2013 themed birthday cards , bobblehead dolls , camo apparel ( pink camo for the ladies ) , cajun-spice seasoning , car fresheners , iphone games ( from the press release : \u201cas players successfully complete the challenges , their beards grow to epic proportions and they start to transform from a yuppie into a full-blown redneck ! \u201d ) , and presumably some sort of camou flage home-pregnancy test .     it \u2019 s easy to see the appeal . the robertsons are immensely likable . they \u2019 re funny . they look cool . they \u2019 re \u201csmarter than they look , \u201d says sportswriter mark schlabach , who co-writes the family \u2019 s books . and they are remarkably honest both with one another and with the viewing audience : phil \u2019 s old hell-raising , si \u2019 s traumatic stint in vietnam , the intervention that the family staged for jep when he was boozing and doing drugs in college ( phil placed him under house arrest for three months ) \u2014 all of it is out in the open . the more they reveal , the more people feel connected to them .     and then , of course , there is their faith , which plays no small role here . during the family \u2019 s initial negotiations about the show with a&e , jase told me , \u201cthe three no-compromises were faith , betrayal of family members , and duck season. \u201d that refusal to betray their faith or one another has been a staple of every media article about the robertson family . it \u2019 s their elevator pitch , and it has made them into ideal christian icons : beloved for staking out a bit of holy ground within the mostly secular , often downright sinful , pop culture of america .     \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7     phil robertson \u2019 s house is located in the sticks about twenty miles outside the city of monroe ( pronounce it mun-roe ) . it \u2019 s a rather small house \u2014 the kind of place its owner would proudly call \u201chumble. \u201d the kitchen table is covered with big plastic tubs of cinnamon rolls and mini muffins . there are candy dishes filled to the brim , bricks of softening butter , and packages of jerky made from unknown animals , sent by unnamed fans . ( i tried some , and it was awesome. ) just inside the front door , a giant flat-screen tv shows fox news on mute at all times , and a bunch of big squishy sofas are arranged in a rectangle around it .     si robertson is sitting on the couch facing the tv . jep robertson , age 35 , the youngest son , curls up in a recliner in the corner with a pistol strapped to his waist . he barely speaks , like a countrified silent bob . jase , 44 , and willie share a love seat while phil lounges barefoot on a camo-patterned recliner in the far corner of the room . two dogs share the recliner \u2019 s footrest with phil \u2019 s heavily callused bare feet . he has severe bunions , so his big toes jut in at forty-five-degree angles . the main tv room is cluttered with mismatched furniture and photos hung haphazardly on the walls . and phil looks like part of the clutter himself , as if he \u2019 d been wedged into that recliner a while back by some absentminded homeowner who didn \u2019 t know where else to put him .\n"}], "hannah": [{"url": "file://test/6/1/1", "title": "test/6/1/1", "content": "article     the cnbc debate kicks off tonight in the shadow of the cain circus . will the other candidates ignore the elephant in the room , and will gingrich finally reach the top tier ? david a. graham on what to look for . plus join howard kurtz for a live chat during the debate , starting at 8pm et .     after three weeks \u2019 respite , the packed republican presidential debate season is about to return to full tilt . the gop field will convene in a detroit suburb on wednesday for a debate hosted by cnbc . using a traditional setup , the debate is supposed to focus on economic issues , including taxation , jobs , and the deficit , but fireworks are likely on a few other topics as well . here \u2019 s what to watch for wednesday night .     1. will the herman cain allegations take center stage ?     last time around , herman cain was a target because his fortunes were rising , along with the popularity of his 9-9-9 plan . much has happened since , and although his polls numbers have flat-lined , not tanked , repeated allegations of sexual harassment or worse seem to be on their way to derailing the cain train . how will his rivals handle it ? they could attack him directly ; even the usually detached romney edged that way tuesday , saying the allegations against cain were serious . but that might be unnecessary and counterproductive . focusing on cain \u2019 s circus rather than , say , high unemployment is bad for the republican brand , so they may instead let him bleed slowly as they avert their eyes .     2. will the \u2018not-mitt \u2019 movement dent romney \u2019 s armor ?     although it \u2019 s long been clear that mitt romney was the man to beat in the republican field , the last two weeks have seen the anybody-but-mitt movement crystallizing like never before . bookended by scathing attacks by george will and erick erickson \u2014 the voices of the old republican establishment and the upstart activist right , respectively \u2014 and peaking with the creation of the website not mitt romney , the former massachusetts governor \u2019 s opponents have come together , transformers-style . but behind whom ? with most of the rest of the field fading or too damaged to take up the standard , jon huntsman jr. , whose once-promising candidacy hasn \u2019 t even gotten as far as spinning its wheels , is making a late play , producing his own anti-romney ad . can huntsman or some other challenger dent romney \u2019 s armor ? or will the unflappable frontrunner parry all blows with the effortless , bland approach he \u2019 s used so far ?     3. will newt gingrich finally join the first tier ?     with cain potentially on the outs , could newt gingrich finally be having his moment ? the former house speaker could appeal to the same voters as cain ( they agree on plenty , as demonstrated by their lovefest on saturday ) , he \u2019 s experienced , and his campaign seems to have come back from several prematurely declared deaths . indeed , he \u2019 s rising in some polls . but gingrich \u2019 s previous debate performances have been polarizing . while some of the more cerebral republican pundits gushed over his oratorical and rhetorical talents , he has a tendency to come across as petulantly contrarian and needlessly pedantic . if he can temper those tendencies , the debate could propel him to the first tier of the race .     4. will rick perry and michele bachmann show up ?     long , long ago \u2014 if you can remember that far back \u2014 both michele bachmann and rick perry were first-tier candidates . their chances at returning to the top tier are slipping away quickly , though perry \u2019 s ample war chest is a crutch . it will be interesting to see how they try to claw back \u2014 if at all . will perry come across as giddy and drunk , as he did in new hampshire last month ? will bachmann figuratively show up ? she has been a nonfactor for several debates , but could try to expand on outreach to moms or maybe go big on religion .     5. will serious economic plans finally make an appearance ?\n"}], "dewei": [{"url": "file://test/6/0/0", "title": "test/6/0/0", "content": "the second ex-wife of peter cook has issued a written apology to his first wife \u2014 supermodel christie brinkley \u2014 for ignoring her warning about the architect \u2019 s philandering .     \u201cchristie and i have talked recently and i have privately apologized to her , but , given the public nature of their divorce and custody battle , i feel a public apology is also appropriate and deserved , \u201d suzanne shaw wrote in a letter obtained by the post thursday .     shaw said she was sorry for bad-mouthing the model by saying in 2012 that \u201cit was the black cloud of christie brinkley \u2019 s hate \u201d that had tainted shaw \u2019 s marriage to cook \u2014 when he had actually been continuing his skirt-chasing ways .     \u201cchristie was wrongly vilified as being an embittered ex-wife , \u201d shaw wrote . \u201ci now believe she had every right to do what she did by taking a public stand ; she was only trying to protect her children and have the truth be told . given the nature of peter \u2019 s behavior , and battles for sole custody of their children , it was necessary for her to confront him publicly. \u201d     christie \u2019 s six-year marriage to cook imploded in 2007 after she learned of his affair with 18-year-old office clerk diana bianchi . cook rebounded by getting hitched to shaw , who stood by his side during his ongoing court battles with brink\u00ad\u00adley . during a 2012 hearing , brinkley tried to warn shaw about cook \u2019 s infidelity .     \u201cwhen you find out he \u2019 s been cheating on you , i \u2019 ll be here for you , \u201d brink\u00adley said in a courthouse hallway .     \u201ccome up with a new line ! \u201d shaw barked back . it turned out brink\u00adley was right , and shaw split with cook this year , accusing him of cheating .     \u201cwhat i say here is by my own volition . i truly feel it \u2019 s simply the right thing to do . i \u2019 m deeply sorry for my part in causing christie any unnecessary pain , \u201d shaw writes .     \u201cunfortunately , i fell under peter \u2019 s spell , but now that the reality of who he is has been revealed , i regret my involvement . christie is a wonderful mother and community member who involves herself in charitable causes and has truly made a contribution to society. \u201d     \u201clast week , christie said , \u2018i wish you the courage to do the right thing for yourself , your daughter and countless women suffering at the hand of an extreme narcissist. \u2019 i believe i have done this now . i thank christie for forgiving me and i wish her only the best .     \u201ci would like to move on with my life now , quietly and privately . peter and i have filed for divorce . i am putting this behind me. \u201d\n"}]}, "user_id_to_descriptions": {"alice": "Is interested in compiling a summary.", "eden": "Knows about the following topics:\nPeter Cook, Suzanne Shaw, divorce, infidelity, Christie Brinkley\nDuck Dynasty, Phil Robertson, A&E, crossbow, Louisiana", "hannah": "Knows about the following topics:\nCNBC debate, Herman Cain, Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich, Rick Perry, Michele Bachmann", "dewei": "Knows about the following topics:\nPeter Cook, Christie Brinkley, Suzanne Shaw, divorce, apology"}, "user_id_to_table_names": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_templated": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_lowprecision": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_lowprecision_templated": {}}
