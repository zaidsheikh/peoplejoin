and even a possible license suspension for drivers who eat , drink , groom , read or use electronic devices behind the wheel .     violators could face a $ 200 to $ 400 fine for the first offense and a $ 400 to $ 600 fine for a second offense . a third or subsequent offense could mean a fine of $ 600 to $ 800 and up to a 90 day license suspension , as well as motor vehicle points .     the sponsors of the bill , assemblyman john wisniewski , d- middlesex and nicholas chiaravalloti , d-hudson , said it is modeled after a law in maine and is intended to educate , not punish drivers .     \" the issue is that we need to try , in every way , to discourage distracted driving , it ' s dangerous , \" wisniewski said . \" education and enforcement can change the attitudes of people . \"     some experts say that motorists must be discouraged from multitasking while driving . others say the bill is an overreach and questioned how police could enforce it .     \" this proposed distracted driving law is not needed , since three statutes can be used when a distraction causes unsafe actions , like swerving or crossing a line , \" said steve carrellas , policy and government affairs director for the national motorists association state chapter . \" there is unsafe driving , careless driving and reckless driving . \"     supporters of the bill must come to terms with the fact that a certain level of multitasking by drivers is a reality , carrellas said .     \" would [ the bill ] make changing the radio station or adjusting the volume illegal ? what about talking to a passenger ? \" carrellas asked .     arnold anderson , the essex county community traffic safety program coordinator , said its imperative that motorists break the habit of doing more than one thing while driving .     \" you ' ve got to get people out of the mindset of multitasking , \" said arnold anderson , \" you can ' t multitask . we are so far away from the mindset of ... just drive . \"     this kills more drivers than anything else     officials from aaa said that a distraction law would be hard to enforce since an officer would have to observe how the driver was distracted , but also that the bill may have a higher purpose .     \" the legislation introduced by assemblyman wisniewski , while admirable in theory , may not help police enforce the law , \" said tracy noble , aaa mid-atlantic spokeswoman .         but a distraction law could have a similar effect as seat belt laws , which noble and anderson credited for increasing seat belt use in the state , even without fines .         \" the more widespread the message of eliminating distractions becomes , the more likely it is to be ingrained in everyday behavior , similar to seat belt usage , \" noble said .     currently , new jersey has laws banning the use of hand-held cell phones and texting while driving , but no prohibitions of other behavior that is considered distracting , according to the state division of highway traffic safety .     larry higgs may be reached at lhiggs@njadvancemedia.com . follow him on twitter @commutinglarry . find nj.com on facebook\n"}, {"url": "file://test/25/1/0",

last qualifying spots on offer at the nebelhorn trophy .     the pair ' s olympic qualification is seen as positive development amid an escalating crisis on the korean peninsula and the potential complications this could have for the games .     the international olympic committee was eager to have north korean athletes at the games and has been supporting several of them in terms of equipment , travel and accommodation in their efforts to qualify .     north korean speed skaters and nordic skiers could join the figure skaters with their own qualifiers coming up .     the pyongyang natives successfully completed a solid short program to music by the beatles on thursday and produced an even better free skate performance to \" je suis qu ' une chanson \" to make sure of one of five olympic qualifying spots on offer .     kim pumped his fists at the end of their routine , hugging his partner before a team official wrapped a jacket over him .     the international skating union ( isu ) confirmed their qualification for pyeongchang , with russia and germany , who were top , having already qualified for the games in south korea .     the final decision regarding their olympic participation rests with the north korean olympic committee which needs to give the green light .     north korea did not have any athletes at the 2014 sochi winter games .     tension on the korean peninsula has risen in recent weeks as north korea ' s leader kim jong un and u.s. president donald trump exchanged war-like threats and insults over the north ' s nuclear and missile development program .     the north has accused trump of declaring war after he warned kim ' s regime would not last if he persisted in threatening the united states and its allies , having earlier warned north korea would be totally destroyed in such an event .     south korean president moon jae-in said in july the north will be given until the last minute to decide whether it will take part in the olympics .\n"}, {"url": "file://test/25/1/2", "title": "test/25/1/2", "content": "the two nations have been on convivial sporting terms this year \u2014 north korea sent its women \u2019 s hockey team

relaxed and open \u2014 to a point \u2014 at a second meeting with reporters after the competition here , the nebelhorn trophy , but requested that no questions be asked about the olympics . their
