variety .         intrepid treasure hunters scour the woods in search of delectable wild mushrooms and their not-quite-meat , not-quite-vegetable qualities .         a bonus : if you find some , you may be eating something not even known to science .     the fungi kingdom is enormously diverse and completely under-documented . species are tough to know , and that is without counting the billions that have gone extinct without us ever knowing about them , but of the 10 million species likely out there , only about 100,000 have been described .                 mushrooms are one the most conspicuous and well known groups of fungi and make up around 16,000 named species , but only a handful of these species are well documented . with estimated rates of fungi extinction exceeding current rates of description , the enormity and urgency of the task of accurate identification cannot be overstated . new approaches that accelerate the documentation and description of new species are desperately needed before it is too late .         so how well do we really know the mushrooms ? in an article published today in peerj , mycologists bryn dentinger and laura martinez-suz from the royal botanic gardens , kew in london set out to ask this question by using dna-based taxonomy . but instead of venturing into the wild in search of never before seen species , they simply went to a local grocer and bought a packet of dried porcini whose intended destiny was more likely a rich risotto than a dna sequencer .     some of the most sought-after of wild mushrooms are the sweet and nutty boletus edulis and allies , often referred to by the italian common name porcini . dentinger has been studying porcini for over 10 years and knew that if the porcini in this packet originated in china , they were likely to be made up of unnamed species . but how many species could be detected in the packet and how quickly could diagnosing and describing them be accomplished ?     drs dentinger and suz arbitrarily selected 15 pieces of mushroom from the packet and sequenced the fungal dna barcode region for each . they then compared these sequences to sequences in the international nucleotide sequence database and classified them based on evolutionary relationships . this revealed three distinct species , none of which were known to science , or had scientific names . to expedite the formal naming process required by the international code of nomenclature for algae , fungi and plants , the researchers used a rapid e-publishing tool that facilitates immediate name registration and species diagnosis to satisfy the rules of the code .                 \" this study demonstrates that the whole procedure , from unknown mushrooms to names , can be done rapidly \u2013 we did this in under a week , but if push came to shove , it could be done in a day \" said dentinger .     hundreds of thousands of tons of porcini are collected from the wild and sold around the world every year , most of it ending up in europe and north america . although typically composed of five well-known species native to these regions ( b. aereus , b. edulis , b. pinophilus , b. reticulatus , b. rex-veris ) , around half of all porcini traded in europe originates in china .         these porcini , typically collected from the wild in yunnan province , have been exported to europe since the 1970s yet until last december , none of them had scientific names . the researchers named them with chinese epithets referring to local common names for porcini ( boletus meiweiniuganjun , boletus bainiugan ) and the chinese word for ' edible ' ( boletus shiyong ) .     as dr dentinger put it , \" our results demonstrate just how ubiquitous unknown fungal diversity is \u2013 it can literally be found right under our noses . \"     the researchers hope that by demonstrating the rapid identification and naming of new fungi species in this way , others in the community will be inspired to continue the important work of identifying new fungi species before they get eaten .... errrr , disappear .\n"}, {"url": "file://train/49/2/1", "title": "train/49/2/1",

and legs .     all six cases of acute flaccid myelitis ( afm ) have been reported since sep. 20 , prompting the minnesota department of health to ask doctors to be on the lookout for the disorder , which has severe consequences but mysterious origins .     \" it is very rare and it is certainly something we ' re taking very seriously , \" said kris ehresmann , who directs the health department ' s infectious disease section . \" it ' s a very devastating situation \" for the children and their families , she said .     the disease attacks the nervous system via the spinal cord , and may be transmitted by a virus . symptoms usually include a sudden onset of arm or leg weakness and loss of muscle reflexes , but can also include drooping eyelids , slurred speech and difficulty swallowing . treatment and therapy restores lost mobility in some children over time , but the syndrome can be fatal in those who lose the muscular function to breathe .     james hill of lakeville said his son , quinton , suffered typical cold symptoms at the start of one school week last month . by the end of the week , he was vomiting and stayed home . by the weekend , his left arm and neck had stiffened badly .     because the disorder is rare \u2014 afflicting less than one in a million children \u2014 doctors at children ' s hospital weren ' t considering it initially , hill said . they conducted blood tests , imaging scans and a spinal tap to arrive at a diagnosis .     orville young , 4 , is one of the children who has suffered lost mobility or paralysis in minnesota due to a rare condition known as afm . the minneapolis boy underwent stimulation therapy at gillette children ' s specialty healthcare in st. paul to try to regain lost leg and arm function .     \" super scary for us , \" he said . \" we had never heard of it . no one had ever heard it . \"     afm came to the attention of the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) in 2014 after clusters of cases were discovered in colorado and california and linked to the spread of a type of virus known as ev-d68 .     states have since reported 362 cases , some with no viral presence and some that seemed linked to other west nile-type viruses .     the six minnesota children , all 10 and younger , were hospitalized due to their conditions . they come from the twin cities , central minnesota and northeastern minnesota . several of the parents contacted the star tribune directly , hoping that news coverage would prompt parents to take precautions and doctors and hospitals to identify the condition quickly when they encounter it .     ehresmann said she hopes that closer study of the children \u2014 and any other cases uncovered through the latest alert to doctors \u2014 could uncover causes .     \" we ' re looking into any kind of commonality , but at this point \u2026 we don ' t have anything to wrap up in a bow , \" she said .     the cases aren ' t even verified by lab test results . ehresmman said it ' s the \" constellation of symptoms \" that ties them together .     mario bros.     elaine young ' s 4-year-old son , orville , was perhaps the first case in the minnesota cluster . last july he came down with typical cold symptoms , which quickly gave way to immobility in his legs and paralysis in his upper right arm . limited muscular activity in his diaphragm also restricted his breathing , at first , which can be a fatal complication of afm .     young said doctors delivered a diagnosis fairly rapidly \u2014 after initially ruling out a stroke \u2014 when she took orville to the university of minnesota masonic children ' s hospital , where a neurologist had written a paper on afm . but confronting one of the first minnesota cases , she had to find out what to do next on her own , she said , and found her way to gillette children ' s specialty services in st. paul .     physical rehabilitation combined with electrical muscular stimulation there over the past two months helped orville regain 90 percent of his leg function . the top half of his right arm remains immobile , though .     \" it definitely affected me and his father much more , emotionally , at least , because we can see into his future , \" young said . \" when you ' re 4 \u2026 every time you wake up it ' s a big new change . so losing the use of your arm ? he said : ' i can ' t give really good hugs anymore , but i ' m doing all of my exercises ! ' \"     orville still plays donkey kong and mario bros. video games , his favorites , because he has use of his right wrist and lower arm .     hill has seen some recovery in his son , even only a week after being hospitalized , with therapy at gillette . unable to move his upper left arm , quinton drags it forward so he can reach legos and build with both hands . the muscles on the left side of his face remain weak , making it hard to smile , blink and swallow .     both children are at risk for a complication known as subluxation , or the dislocation of their dormant arms , if they don ' t keep them moving .     \" keep lefty involved with righty , \" therapists tell quinton .     three cases in 2014     while this is the largest cluster to be reported in minnesota , it is not the first in the state . minnesota had three cases in 2014 , and single cases in some years since then . nationally , most cases have been reported each year in september .     in addition to viruses , health officials suspect the syndrome is linked to unknown genetic and environmental factors . treatments include steroid medications and immunoglobulin infusions to boost the child ' s immune system .     most cases start with cold symptoms followed by loss of movement on one side of the body , and can be verified by imaging scans that detect inflammation in a central part of the spinal cord , said dr. anu kalaskar , an infectious disease specialist at children ' s . but treatment varies with each case , and has involved respiratory support for children struggling to breathe .     the risk of transmission is low and can be further reduced by standard cold prevention practices such as washing hands and covering coughs , she said .     the cdc has been collaborating with researchers to understand afm , to estimate how many cases occurred before 2014 , and to determine why cases increased substantially starting that year .     mehdi ayouche ' s 5-year-old daughter , sophia , is still hospitalized at children ' s in minneapolis . the chanhassen father worries that lost mobility in her neck and right arm might make it hard for her to do the things she loves \u2014 from swimming and drawing to tae kwon do . he is hopeful that therapy will help , and relieved that sophia ' s twin brother and older sister did not get the syndrome , despite having cold symptoms .     \" we want to make people aware , \" he said . \" it is a rare condition .

"content": "news release     october 5 , 2018         contact information     statement on cases of acute flaccid myelitis     the minnesota department of health ( mdh ) issued the following statement today regarding reported cases of acute flaccid myelitis ( afm ) in six children around the state over the last few weeks . afm is a rare but potentially severe condition that can arise following an infection , and in some cases it can lead to death , paralysis or other long-term health impacts .     the minnesota department of health ( mdh ) is investigating six cases of a rare condition called acute flaccid myelitis ( afm ) that occurred since mid-september in minnesota children .     afm is a rare but serious condition that affects the nervous system , causing muscles to weaken . it can be a complication following a viral infection , but environmental and genetic factors may also contribute to its development . afm symptoms include sudden muscle weakness in the arms or legs , sometimes following a respiratory illness . other symptoms may include :     neck weakness or stiffness     drooping eyelids or a facial droop .     difficulty swallowing or slurred speech .     mdh disease investigators are working aggressively with health care providers to gather information about the cases . the department is also in contact with the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) to share information .     for reasons not fully understood , afm affects mainly children . all recent minnesota cases have been in children under 10 years old and all were hospitalized . cases have been reported from the twin cities , central minnesota and northeastern minnesota .     there was a national uptick in afm cases in 2014. disease investigators believe this was linked to an outbreak of a respiratory illness in children that was caused by a virus known as enterovirus d 68 ( evd68 ) . minnesota saw three afm cases that year . since then , we have typically seen less than one case a year .     since afm can develop as a result of a viral infection , mdh recommends parents and children take basic steps to avoid infections and stay healthy :     wash your hands frequently to limit your exposure to germs .     cover your cough or sneeze .     stay home if you are sick .     stay up to date on vaccinations .     protect yourself and children from mosquito bites if you \u2019 re spending time outside .     if parents see potential symptoms of afm in their child , ( for example , if he or she is not using an arm ) they should contact their health care provider as soon as possible . afm can be diagnosed by examining a person \u2019 s nervous system , taking an mri scan and testing the cerebral spinal fluid . it is important that tests are done as soon as possible after someone develops symptoms . while there is no specific treatment for afm , doctors may recommend certain interventions on a case-by-case basis .     -mdh-     doug schultz     mdh communications
