australia .     the 62-year-old was found by police about 6am on tuesday and has been flown to kalgoorlie hospital for treatment . the abc reported police search teams found foggerdy after following a fresh trail of footprints , which were discovered on monday , for 15km .     kalgoorlie police superintendent andy greatwood told abc radio that foggerdy had \u201cno water whatsoever for six days \u201d and was \u201cextremely dehydrated [ and a ] bit delusional \u201d when he was first found , but was able to talk after receiving first aid .     \u201cthe amazing news is his last couple of days of survival were achieved by lying down under a tree and eating black ants , so that \u2019 s the level of survival that mr foggerdy has gone to , \u201d greatwood said .     foggerdy had been missing since wednesday when he left shooter \u2019 s shack campsite on the edge of the great victoria desert , 1,120km east of perth . he was armed with a rifle and planned to hunt the feral camels that roam the australian interior . he left wearing shorts , a t-shirt , thongs and a baseball cap . police believe he was not carrying food or water .     when he had not returned by thursday morning , his brother ray drove 170km to laverton , the nearest town , to get enough mobile reception to report him missing to police .     foggerdy , who has been described by his family as an experienced bushman , appears to have shot and killed a camel a short distance from the camp . the carcass was the central point of the police-coordinated land and aerial search .     bob cooper , an outback survival expert who has written a book on the topic , told guardian australia that the combination of dehydration , which impairs brain function , and the panic of being lost was \u201cprobably the worst thing you can put people through \u201d .     \u201cfear turns a mishap into a tragedy , \u201d cooper said . \u201cjust because your car won \u2019 t start , that isn \u2019 t a tragedy , particularly when it has probably got most of what you need in it . but people panic and start walking. \u201d     that is what appears to have happened to two men who died in january after abandoning their vehicles and trying to walk for help .         on 4 january , a car driven by a 60-year-old man broke down between wonganoo and windidda stations , near lake carnegie on the edge of the little sandy desert , about 1,000km north-east of perth .     according to an abc report , the man camped next to the car with the woman he was travelling with for one night before setting off the next morning to walk the 48km to windidda station in 40c heat . his body was found on the roadside 2km from the station on 7 january . the woman , who remained with the car for an extra night before walking , was found alive by station workers the same day .     nine days later and about 400km away , clayton miller , a 39-year-old truck driver , became bogged on his way to moorarie station , 140km north-west of meekatharra and 15km past the mileura station homestead . he started walking back to mileura after trying and failing to dig the truck out , and made it 13km before doubling back . his body was found 1.1km from his truck , which was reported to be carrying ample water .     neither man had a satellite phone or an emergency beacon to call for help .     cooper said dehydration impeded rational thought , which was why so many people ignored survival rule no 1 : stay with your vehicle if you have one , and stay with water .     \u201cthe organ most affected by dehydration is the brain , \u201d he said . \u201cyour ability to think rationally is diminished by up to 30 % and that can happen within an hour .     \u201cthe combination of dehydration and fear is probably the worst thing you can put people through . people don \u2019 t know where they are going but they are running to it. \u201d     cooper said reliance on technology should take second place to basic survival skills , like knowing how to use a compass . he said people travelling in remote country , even on routine journeys , should give an explicit itinerary to a trusted person and make sure that person raises the alarm the minute a check-in is missed \u2013 not hours later .     people stranded with their car should stay with the vehicle , which in outback areas should contain at least 20 litres , or one week \u2019 s worth , of water . more could be collected as it condensed from the vehicle \u2019 s air conditioning unit .     he also recommended people stranded start a large smoky fire \u2013 the black smoke sent up by a deflated spare tyre is a favoured option \u2013 and use mirrors and a foil survival blanket to attract attention from aerial patrols . abc local radio broadcasts news of every search .     \u201ci have had people in our courses that have \u2026 heard their name come on the radio and said , \u2018oh , thank god \u2013 they are looking for me. \u2019 \u201d     if you are lost or stranded without a car , cooper said , you should be carrying water , something to light a fire , snake-bite bandages and a foil blanket .     \u201cthe police helicopters now have heat-vision cameras and night-vision cameras that can pick up the luminous numbers on a watch from 2km away , \u201d he said . \u201cmake things easier for the people who want to help you. \u201d\n"}, {"url": "file://train/14/0/3", "title": "train/14/0/3", "content": "lost hunter reginald foggerdy survived six days in remote bush by eating ants and lying under tree     updated

bad guy ' s exit     itoggle caption gary d. gaugler/science source     for the first time in decades , researchers trying to develop a vaccine for malaria have discovered a new target they can use to attack this deadly and common parasite .     finding a target for attack is a far cry from having a vaccine . and the history of malaria vaccines is littered with hopeful ideas that didn ' t pan out . still , researchers in the field welcome this fresh approach .     over the past four decades , researchers have developed about 100 potential vaccines for malaria . the best of the bunch is still only modestly successful in children , who are at greatest risk for the disease . the mosquito-borne parasite kills more than 600,000 children a year , mostly in africa .     so dr. jonathan kurtis , at the rhode island hospital and brown university , decided it was time for a fresh start . he had developed a severe case of malaria while he was an undergraduate studying abroad in kenya . and he learned just how devastating this disease can be , not only killing young children but causing hundreds of millions of cases of debilitating illness every year .     kurtis and his colleagues started with samples of blood that had been methodically collected from children in tanzania by drs . michal fried and patrick duffy at the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases . kurtis ' team carefully examined those samples to find small but crucial differences between children who got infected but didn ' t fall seriously ill and children who developed a severe case of the disease .     \" we ' re finding the rare needle in a haystack , \" kurtis says . \" we ' re finding the rare parasite protein that generates a protective immune response . \"     earlier vaccine efforts have produced antibodies that target proteins on the malaria parasite that it uses to break into red blood cells \u2014 the parasite reproduces inside those cells . but the particular parasite protein that kurtis isolated from the blood of these children wasn ' t part of that invasion pathway .     our parasite protein is critical for the parasite ' s escape from the red cell . and it needs to escape from the red cell if it ' s going to go on and infect other red cells and multiply .     \" our parasite protein is critical for the parasite ' s escape from the red cell , \" he says . \" and it needs to escape from the red cell if it ' s going to go on and infect other red cells and multiply . \"     when kurtis looked at children who had been infected with the malaria parasite but didn ' t get seriously ill , he discovered that their young immune systems had produced antibodies that attack this escape protein . in this group of children , not one of them developed serious illness from malaria , \" which is sort of astonishing , actually , \" kurtis says .     he and his colleagues report this result in the latest science magazine . but this is just the beginning of the story .     this is a long way from a vaccine that can be used in humans . but i do think this addresses ... one of the problems with the current malaria vaccine approach .     \" this is a long way from a vaccine that can be used in humans , \" says dr. dyann wirth , at the harvard school of public health .     \" but i do think this addresses what i feel is one of the problems with the current malaria vaccine approach , \" wirth says . \" and that is the field seems to be focused on molecules that were discovered decades ago . \"     this really is a fresh idea , she says , championed by a scientist who is not personally invested in the molecules discovered long ago .     since even the best of those earlier molecules is only partially effective , the field could really use some new ideas .     for his part , kurtis isn ' t promising that his discovery will be the be-all and end-all for malaria prevention .     \" it would ludicrously fortuitous to think that this would be a stand-alone vaccine , \" he says .     but if it works even partially , it could eventually be used in combination with other malaria vaccines to deliver a one-two punch against the parasite .     there ' s a lot more testing to do . the potential vaccine will be tried in monkeys , and if it looks promising there , kurtis can start the long and challenging process of testing it in people .\n"},
