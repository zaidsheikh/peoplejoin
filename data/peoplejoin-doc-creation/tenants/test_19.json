"test/19/0/0", "content": "( cnn ) it was an oddly familiar o.j . simpson that for a little while filled tv screens across america on thursday .     a nevada parole board decided simpson should be freed after the former nfl star apologized for his role in a 2007 armed robbery , said he ' d been a model prisoner , and promised that he ' d have no conflicts if released .     simpson ' s appearance before the board garnered wall-to-wall coverage from cable news shows , coverage that recalled the \" trial of the century , \" and the many months more than 20 years ago when it transfixed a nation .     \" i ' ve done my time , \" simpson said . \" i ' ve done it as well and as respectfully as i think anyone can . \"     now 70 , simpson ' s energy seemed little affected by his time behind bars . he was alert , engaged , and quick to smile , even letting out a hearty laugh when parole board chairman connie bisbee accidentally said he was aged 90 . \" i feel like it , \" he said .     simpson has served nine years of a nine-to-33-year sentence for an armed robbery and kidnapping in las vegas . he is expected to be released as early as october -- and said he plans to move to his home in florida .     an entire generation of americans has come of age since simpson seemed an almost inescapable public figure . but for one afternoon , it felt like 1995 again .     that was the year he was acquitted of murder charges in the grisly slayings of his ex-wife nicole brown simpson and her friend ronald goldman .     thursday ' s parole hearing followed renewed interest in his story , which was explored last year in the award-winning documentary \" o.j . : made in america \" and the fx true-crime drama \" the people v. o.j . simpson . \"     though it ' s been 22 years since the not guilty verdict , the murder trial ' s themes of criminal justice and race , trust in police , celebrity and domestic violence remain remarkably resonant in modern culture . \" we talk about o.j . as though the story is o.j. , \" journalist celia farber says toward the end of the \" made in america \" documentary . \" the story is o.j . and us . \"     parole board vote unanimous     for his part , simpson seemed remarkably unaltered . he repeatedly avoided taking full responsibility for the vegas crime .     at one point , he said he had lived a \" conflict-free life , \" a statement that perhaps bemused anyone whose memory stretches back more than two decades .     \" juice , \" as he was known in his heyday , said associates misled him during the vegas robbery and then turned on him in court .     one of those associates is tom riccio . simpson testified that riccio is the one who called him , persuading him to take part in the robbery . simpson said thursday he regretted ever taking riccio ' s call .     but , according to riccio , simpson did a lot more than that .     \" he should wish he didn ' t make all those calls after my call , \" riccio told cnn . \" after he took my call he did a lot of things he shouldn ' t have done . \"     riccio added that simpson was the one who orchestrated the robbery .     \" he plotted it all and gathered up men with guns . \"     simpson said riccio avoided punishment by throwing him under the bus .     \" unfortunately , they got a get-out-of-jail-free card when they said ' o.j . told me ( to do it ) , ' \" simpson said . \" nothing i can do about that . \"     sufficient remorse is not a relevant factor for parole , and simpson ticked off several mitigating factors that made him a good candidate for release . he was discipline-free in prison , he has stable release plans , he has family and community support -- and , of course , he has no prior criminal convictions .     the four parole board members voted unanimously to grant him parole , and board member tony corda said he was graded a \" low risk to reoffend . \"     simpson smiled , said \" thank you , \" and then put his head down for a few moments silently .     o.j . simpson wins parole after serving nine years for armed robbery and kidnapping https://t.co/di9nlhrsi6 https://t.co/g3ecawr0u2 \u2014 cnn ( @cnn ) july 20 , 2017     ' my best friend '     simpson said in closing remarks that he had been a peacemaker in the prison and had been a model prisoner .     \" i ' ve spent nine years making no excuses about anything . i am sorry that things turned out the way they did . i had no intent to commit a crime . \"     the parole hearing featured testimony from arnelle simpson , the former football great ' s oldest daughter , who said her father was \" my best friend and my rock . \"     simpson also said he has taken two \" alternative to violence \" classes , which he said was \" the most important course any person in this prison can take . \"     in addition , robbery victim bruce fromong testified that he had forgiven simpson for the crime at that las vegas hotel room , and advocated for his release .     simpson had also been described by authorities as a model prisoner at lovelock correctional center , a medium-security prison in the nevada desert .     the robbery     simpson and an associate were convicted of kidnapping , armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon for attempting to steal pieces of simpson sports memorabilia at gunpoint .     at his 2008 sentencing , the hall of fame running back said he went to the room in the palace station hotel &amp; casino in las vegas to reclaim family heirlooms and other personal items that had been taken from him . he also claimed he didn ' t know his associates were armed .     \" i wasn ' t there to hurt anybody , \" simpson said . \" i just wanted my personal things , and i realize now that was stupid of me . i am sorry . \"     the case , which featured a colorful cast of seedy characters , secret recordings and a las vegas heist , read like a low-budget parody of \" ocean ' s eleven , \" cnn wrote at the time     photos : the rise and fall

\u2019 d be the president of the united states . \"     \" so it \u2019 s sad for me to hear that he \u2019 s denying knowing about strauss , \" he said . \" i don \u2019 t know why he would , unless it \u2019 s a cover-up . either you \u2019 re in on it , or you \u2019 re a liar. \u201d     a former teammate of disabato \u2019 s who asked not to be identified said he never told jordan directly that strauss had abused him . but there is no way jordan could have avoided the rumors \u201cbecause it was all over the locker room. \u201d     \u201ci love jimmy to death , \u201d the ex-wrestler said . \u201cit was a head-scratcher to me why he would say he didn \u2019 t know anything . doc used to take showers with the team even though he didn \u2019 t do any workouts , and everybody used to snicker about how you go into his office for a sore shoulder and he tells you to take your pants down. \u201d     when the first stories about the university investigation appeared this spring , jordan told the columbus dispatch , \u201ci had not heard about any type of abuse at all. \u201d he also said that \u201cno one reported any type of abuse \u201d to him .     after nbc news reached out to jordan , the congressman \u2019 s spokesman repeated the denial .     \u201ccongressman jordan never saw any abuse , never heard about any abuse , and never had any abuse reported to him during his time as a coach at ohio state , \u201d his spokesman , ian fury , said in an email to nbc news .     shortly after the nbc news story was published , fury added the following statement : \" he has not been contacted by investigators about the matter but will assist them in any way they ask , because if what is alleged is true , the victims deserve a full investigation and justice. \u201d     but kathleen trafford of porter wright morris &amp; arthur , the dayton , ohio-based law firm that was appointed as legal counsel to ohio state , said in a statement that investigators \" had previously contacted rep. jordan ' s office by email and phone to request that he participate in an interview . \"     \" to date , rep. jordan has not responded to those requests , \" trafford wrote . \" the investigative team is continuing its efforts to schedule an interview with rep . jordan . \"     jordan , a founder of the house freedom caucus , a group of the most conservative representatives , is a staunch ally of president donald trump and is frequently mentioned as a possible replacement for the speaker of the house , paul ryan .     ryan , through his spokesman doug andres , also weighed in on the ohio state investigation and jordan ' s role .     \" these are serious allegations and issues , \" andres said . \" the university has rightfully initiated a full investigation into the matter . the speaker will await the findings of that inquiry . \"     disabato forwarded to nbc news an email he sent on april 24 to jordan and the congressman \u2019 s brother , jeff , who runs jeff jordan ' s state champ camp , a nationally known wrestling camp in ohio . disabato sent the email 19 days after ohio state announced on april 5 that it was investigating strauss and the administrators of the wrestling program at the time , including the coaches , just as other colleges have done in similar circumstances .     disabato was concerned that the university would ultimately sweep his allegations under the rug , and he wanted to ensure that jordan would back him up .     \u201ci ask you to give your full attention to the information attached to this email , \u201d disabato wrote . \u201cwe [ are ] watching you . \u2026 you have the platform to cut through the double talk , placation and finger pointing. \u201d     jordan and his brother did not reply to the email , disabato said . jeff jordan said in an email that he ' d never attended or worked at ohio state university .     rep. jim jordan speaks during a hearing before the house judiciary committee on capitol hill on june 28. alex wong / getty images     jim jordan , who has made a name for himself in congress by grilling investigators probing alleged collusion by the trump campaign with the russians , is among the witnesses expected to be questioned by the law firm that ohio state hired to conduct the probe into strauss \u2019 misconduct , officials involved with the investigation said .     in the video that disabato made about the allegations against strauss , which disabato sent to ohio state in june , hellickson , the former head wrestling coach , said he told school administrators about strauss and also warned the doctor to steer clear of his wrestlers .     \u201ci said , \u2018you make the guys nervous when you shower with them , \u2019 \u201d hellickson said in the video . \u201chis response was , \u2018coach , you shower with your guys all the time. \u2019 and i said , \u2018not for an hour , doc. \u2019 \u201d     disabato and his former teammates

wrestler said .     hellickson , an olympics silver medalist in wrestling in 1976 who has done commentary from the games for nbc sports , did not return calls for comment .     in response to a series of questions from nbc , ohio state emailed a statement saying that the law firm perkins coie was overseeing the probe into the strauss allegations for the university . osu said it has also reached out

more than 150 former students and witnesses and is engaged in further investigative efforts , \u201d the university said in the statement . \u201cohio state has shared all additional information that has come to the attention of the university with the independent investigators whose work is ongoing. \u201d     it \u2019 s unclear whether former ohio state coaches or administrators could face any penalties from the university for not protecting wrestlers from strauss .     \u201cour efforts will continue to be focused on uncovering what may have happened during this era , what university leaders at the time may have known , and whether any response at the time was appropriate , \u201d the university \u2019 s statement said . \u201conce the independent investigation has been completed , we will be in a position to consider what further action might be appropriate. \u201d     jordan is wrestling royalty . born and raised in champaign county , ohio , he was a four-time state

on students who played other sports .     \u201cstrauss sexually assaulted male athletes in at least fifteen varsity sports during his employment at osu from 1978 through 1998 , \u201d disabato wrote

protest if the doctor told them to disrobe , for fear of losing their scholarships . he said coaches knew that strauss was a predator .     \u201ceverybody knew before you were going into the [ examination ] room that doc strauss was going to touch you , \u201d disabato said . \u201cit was like a joke before you went in there. \u201d     strauss wasn \u2019 t the only ohio state official who showered with the team , disabato said . after practice ended at 3 : 30 p.m. , some university professors , administrators and others would show up in the shower stalls just as the athletes were arriving , he said .     it was , disabato said , like walking through \u201cthe gauntlet of sexual deviancy. \u201d     another former wrestler whose testimony appears on the video disabato submitted to investigators described how strauss grabbed his penis during an examination .     \u201ci didn \u2019 t do a thing , \u201d he said when asked how he responded . \u201cprobably , because i was scared. \u201d     he broke down when asked why , after all these years , he was speaking out .     \u201cwhy am i doing this now ? it \u2019 s just hard , \u201d he said . \u201ci don \u2019 t want this to ever have to happen to anybody else , ever \u2026 at the ohio state university or any school. \u201d\n"}]}, "user_id_to_descriptions": {"alice": "Is interested in compiling a summary.",
