investigators obtained surveillance images from a walmart on east i-240 service road in oklahoma city , oklahoma from the afternoon of march 15th , showing tad cummins and elizabeth thomas shopping at

investigators since the alleged kidnapping on march 13th \u2013 clearly show tad cummins with an altered appearance to darken his hair . the same images show elizabeth may currently have red hair . efforts to determine what vehicle they were traveling in remain ongoing .     thomas , 15 , disappeared on monday , march 13th and is believed to have been kidnapped by 50-year-old tad cummins , a former teacher at her school in maury county , tennessee . the school district in maury county terminated cummins in the wake of an ongoing investigation into alleged inappropriate contact he had with thomas at the school earlier this year .     thomas is a 15-year-old white female , with hazel eyes , stands 5 ' 0 \" and weighs 120 pounds . she was last seen wearing a flannel shirt and black leggings . cummins is a white male , who stands 6 ' 0 \" , weighs approximately 200 pounds , and has brown hair and eyes . he is believe to be armed with two handguns and driving a silver nissan rogue

guiana     europe has launched the gaia satellite - one of the most ambitious space missions in history .     the 740m-euro ( \u00a3 620m ) observatory lifted off from the sinnamary complex in french guiana at 06 : 12 local time ( 09 : 12 gmt ) .     gaia is going to map the precise positions and distances to more than a billion stars .     this should give us the first realistic picture of how our milky way galaxy is constructed .     gaia ' s remarkable sensitivity will lead also to the detection of many thousands of previously unseen objects , including new planets and asteroids .     it will allow us , for the first time ever , to walk through the milky way - to say where everything is , to say what everything is prof gerry gilmore , cambridge university     separation from the soyuz upper-stage was confirmed just before 10 : 00 gmt .     the satellite is now travelling out to an observing station some 1.5 million km from the earth on its nightside - a journey that will take about a month to complete .     gaia has been in development for more than 20 years .     it will be engaged in what is termed astrometry - the science of mapping the locations and movements of celestial objects .     to do this , it carries two telescopes that throw light on to a huge , one-billion-pixel camera detector connected to a trio of instruments .     gaia will use this ultra-stable and supersensitive optical equipment to pinpoint its sample of stars with extraordinary confidence .     gaia - the discovery machine     gaia will make a very precise 3d map of our milky way galaxy     it is the successor to the hipparcos satellite which mapped some 100,000 stars     the one billion to be catalogued by gaia is still only 1 % of the milky way ' s total     but the survey ' s quality promises a raft of discoveries beyond just the star map     it will find new asteroids and planets ; it will test physical constants and theories     gaia ' s sky map will be the reference to guide future telescopes ' observations     by repeatedly viewing its targets over five years , it should get to know the brightest stars ' coordinates down to an error of just seven micro-arcseconds .     \" this angle is equivalent to the size of a euro coin on the moon as seen from earth , \" explained prof alvaro gimenez , esa ' s director of science .     gaia will compile profiles on the stars it sees .     as well as working out how far away they are , the satellite will study their motion across the sky .     their physical properties will also be catalogued - details such as brightness , temperature , and composition . it should even be possible then to determine their ages .     and for about 150 million of these stars , gaia will measure their velocity either towards or away from us .     this will enable scientists to use them as three-dimensional markers to trace the evolution of the milky way , to in essence make a time-lapse movie that can be run forwards to see what happens in the future , or run backwards to reveal how the galaxy was assembled in the past .     and because gaia will track anything that passes across its camera detector , it is likely also to see a colossal number of objects that have hitherto gone unrecorded - such as comets , asteroids , planets beyond our solar system , cold dead stars , and even tepid stars that never quite fired into life .     \" it will allow us , for the first time ever , to walk through the milky way - to say where everything is , to say what everything is . it is truly a transformative mission , \" said prof gerry gilmore from cambridge university , uk .     by the end of the decade , the gaia archive of processed data is expected to exceed 1 petabyte ( 1 million gigabytes ) , equivalent to about 200,000 dvds of information .     this store is so vast that it will keep professional astronomers busy for decades .     \" to think that you see individual scientific papers coming out now that talk about just a single object - a single star or exoplanet . and very soon , because of gaia , we will have information on a billion objects . what will the scientific literature look like then ? \" pondered dr michael perryman , the former gaia esa project scientist now affiliated to princeton university , us .     \" of course , there will be big statistical projects you can tackle with this data , but it is clear the scale of gaia means this information is not going to be superseded for a very long time , \" he told bbc news .     as the earth goes around the sun , relatively nearby stars appear to move against the ' fixed ' stars that are even further away     because we know the sun-earth distance , we can use the parallax angle to work out the distance to the target star     but such angles are very small - less than one arcsecond for the nearest stars , or 0.05 % of the full moon ' s diameter     gaia will make repeat observations to reduce measurement errors down to seven micro-arcseconds for the very brightest stars     parallaxes are used to anchor other , more indirect techniques on the ' ladder ' deployed to measure the most far-flung distances     it will though offer ample scope for citizen scientists to mine gaia ' s data to make their own discoveries , and a number of crowdsourcing projects to facilitate this activity will get under way next year .     gaia is the result of an enormous industrial effort led by astrium satellites in toulouse , france . \" for this masterpiece , for this jewel of space hardware , astrium gathered and led an industrial consortium made up of 50 companies - 47 european , three north american , \" said ceo eric beranger .     \" coming to [ french guiana ] and seeing our satellite lifting off brings me huge emotion .

major lawsuit has been filed in california against ja rule and billy mcfarland , organizers of the fyre festival , the two-weekend concert in the bahamas that was scheduled for last weekend but collapsed in disorganization before it started . the suit was filed on sunday in the u.s. district court for the central district of california by celebrity trial lawyer mark geragos , who is seeking class action status . geragos filed suit electronically on sunday on behalf of plaintiff daniel jung , who is seeking $ 5 million in damages for alleged fraud , breach of contract , breach of covenant of good faith and negligent misrepresentation .     the suit anticipates a class of \u201cmore than 150 \u201cplaintiffs for whom it seeks a minimum of $ 100 million . geragos will be busy over the upcoming week seeking out other litigants to join the suit , which alleges that the \u201cfestival \u2019 s lack of adequate food , water , shelter , and medical care created a dangerous and panicked situation among attendees \u2014 suddenly finding themselves stranded on a remote island without basic provisions \u2014 that was closer to \u2018the hunger games \u2019 or \u2018lord of the flies \u2019 than coachella. \u201d     the suit claims as its causes of action : fraud , breach of contract , breach of covenant of good faith and negligent misrepresentation and seeks a minimum of $ 100 million in damages . it is believed a crowd of approximately 6,000 attendees was expected to attend the festival , though it is unclear how many tickets were actually sold .     tickets to fyre fest cost anywhere from $ 1,000 to $ 125,000 for luxury group packages to the event , which was to have run in two parts : april 28-30 and may 5-7 on the private fyre cay in the grand bahamas exuma island chain . performers were to include blink-182 , migos , major lazer and disclosure . by april 27 social media began lighting up with reports of distressed guests , arriving to find not the luxury accommodations they \u2019 d signed up for , but a dirt field with flimsy tents .     in the past , geragos has represented michael jackson , winona ryder , singer kesha and politician gary condit in high-profile cases .     jung claims to have spent $ 2,000 on his fyre festival ticket and airfare . for that , he and fellow \u201cfestival-goers survived on bare rations , little more than bread and a slice of cheese , and tried to escape the elements in the only shelter provided by defendants : small clusters of \u2018fema tents , \u2019 exposed on a sand bar , that were soaked and battered by wind and rain. \u201d     the commonwealth of bahamas may well file a suit of its own . tmz reported the bahamas \u201cstands to lose out on millions with the festival being called off \u2026 and tourism officials are devastated. \u201d the ministry of tourism released a statement saying it is \u201cextremely disappointed. \u201d     abc news reports that the festival site is now in \u201clockdown \u201d by the island \u2019 s government . \u201cprivate security guards were seen saturday protecting the main site where people had been slated to sleep in luxury tents , \u201d abc reported , alleging mcfarland failed to pay customs duty taxes \u201con items that he imported for the event , \u201d and that \u201che and his staff have left the items with a security company guarding it. \u201d     having removed promotional materials for the festival , the fyre fest official website now offers its explanation for the disastrous turn of events , claiming the organizers were overwhelmed by the response after news of the fest went viral . finding the island couldn \u2019 t support the swelling crowd , it was decided \u201cinfrastructure for a festival of this magnitude needed to be built from the ground up . so , we decided to literally attempt to build a city . we set up water and waste management , brought an ambulance from new york , and chartered 737 planes to shuttle our guests via 12 flights a day from miami. \u201d mcfarland made similar comments to rolling stone and in a video posted on tmz .     to say the efforts fell short is an understatement . the suit alleges that festival attendees became virtual prisoners : \u201cfaced with the complete lack of even the most basic amenities , as well as no assistance from defendants , festival attendees began to panic . predictably , attendees began attempting to leave the island en masse , but found themselves trapped \u2014 even locked inside an airport awaiting delayed flights. \u201d     efforts to \u201cescape , \u201d the suit claims , \u201cwere hamstrung by their reliance upon defendants for transportation , as well as by the fact that defendants promoted the festival as a \u2018cashless \u2019 event \u2014 defendants instructed attendees to upload funds to a wristband for use at the festival rather than bringing any cash . as such , attendees were unable to purchase basic transportation on local taxis or busses , which accept only cash . as a result \u2026 at least one attendee suffered a medical emergency and lost consciousness after being locked inside a nearby building with other concert-goers waiting to be airlifted from the island. \u201d     given that the festivals organizers did not have the funds to compensate the entertainers booked to perform \u2014 and it is unclear as to whether they had insurance \u2014 speculation has begun that geragos may go after some of the bigger name models who took part in promoting the ill-fated event . celebrities \u201cincluding kendall jenner , bella hadid and emily ratajkowski \u201d were cited by name in the complaint , which says they used their social media accounts \u201cto generate ticket sales. \u201d the website fashionlaw.com speculates the models \u2019 participation in promoting the site may trigger a federal trade commission proceeding for false advertising .     although the fyre fest organizers have offered to give all disappointed 2017 festival-goers free tickets to the 2018 iteration , which they said they intend to hold in the united states , it \u2019 s clear that this isn \u2019 t going to make the problem go away and that all involved have a long legal slog ahead .     neither geragos , mcfarland nor a representative for ja rule replied for requests for

defendants had been aware for months that their festival was dangerously under-equipped and posed a serious danger to anyone in attendance , \" the lawsuit added .     \" more troublingly , mr.
