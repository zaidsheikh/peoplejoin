authorities confirmed thursday that a woman was forced to abort seven months into her pregnancy , several days after her plight came to light when images of her baby ' s corpse were posted online .     rights groups have blamed authorities in north china ' s shaanxi province for forcing feng jianmei to abort her pregnancy because she failed to pay a hefty fine for exceeding china ' s strict \" one-child \" population control policy .     the shaanxi provincial government said in a statement that a preliminary probe had confirmed the case was \" basically true \" , and the investigators have recommended action be taken against the perpetrators .     \" this is a serious violation of the national population and family planning commission ' s policies , jeopardises the population control work and has caused uneasiness in society , \" the provincial government said on its website .     the government did not pinpoint exactly who the perpetrators were , but vowed to avoid a repeat of such a case , which it said was against regulations in effect since 2001 banning late-term abortions .     chinese web users have reacted in anger to the abortion , with one comparing it to acts perpetrated by \" japanese devils and nazis \" , after photos online showed feng lying on a hospital bed next to the blood-smeared body of her baby .     a relative told afp on wednesday that feng and her husband had opposed the termination .     an official at the national family planning commission who declined to be named said earlier that the commission viewed the matter as \" serious and important \" and that the probe was being handled at the \" top level \" .     china has implemented its draconian family planning policy since the late 1970s in an effort to control a population that has grown to 1.3 billion people , the world ' s largest .     under the policy , urban families are generally allowed to have one child , while rural families can give birth to two children if the first is a girl . they have to pay a fine if they contravene the rules .     rights groups say that as a result of the policy , thousands of women have been forced by authorities to terminate their pregnancies .     blind activist chen guangcheng , who recently left china for the united states after fleeing house arrest , was once jailed after angering local officials for bringing to light hundreds of forced abortions .     official statistics show that since the start of the policy , the number of abortions peaked in 1983 , with a total of 14.37 million terminations that year .     the us said monday it has expressed opposition to china ' s one-child policy after activists reported that a five-month-pregnant woman faces an imminent forced abortion in a separate case .     \" we make no secret that the united states strongly oppose all aspects of china ' s coercive birth limitation policies , including forced abortion and sterilisation , and we always raise these issues with the chinese government , \" state department spokeswoman victoria nuland said .     copyright \u00a9 2012 afp . all rights reserved . more \u00bb\n"}, {"url": "file://test/43/2/1", "title": "test/43/2/1",

( associated press )     washington ( ap ) \u2014 an immigration adviser to president-elect donald trump and a possible candidate for a top government post wants to make some changes at the homeland security department , including recreating a system that required certain immigrants , including men and boys from 25 mostly muslim nations , to register with the federal government upon their arrival .     kansas secretary of state kris kobach met with trump on sunday and brought with him a detailed list of proposals for the agency tasked with enforcing immigration laws and securing the border . kobach carried his \" department of homeland security kobach strategic plan for first 365 days \" into his meeting with trump . it was visible in a photograph from the associated press .     the top suggestion was to \" update and reintroduce \" the national security entry-exit registration system , or nseers , for all foreigners from \" high-risk \" areas , a program he helped create while working for the justice department in the wake of the sept. 11 terrorist attacks .     the effort , which ultimately included the registration of more than 80,000 foreigners , was widely derided by civil rights groups who said it profiled foreigners based on their race and religion .     the document , which is partially obscured by kobach ' s left arm and hand , does not specify which foreigners would be required to register as part of an nseers update .     kobach did not immediately respond to requests for comment .     the obama administration formally abandoned the system in april 2011 , saying a newer data collection program would be sufficient to collect biometric information for all foreigners coming into the country .     kobach ' s plan also proposes adding \" extreme vetting questions for high-risk \" foreigners coming into the u.s. those would include questions about a would-be visitor ' s \" support for sharia law , jihad , equality of men and women , the united states constitution . \"     the kansan ' s list also included ending the flow of syrian refugees into the united states . as a candidate , trump proposed a temporary ban on all muslims coming into the country .     several other suggestions for dhs were obscured in the photo , taken as kobach was greeted by trump .     immigration was a top issue for trump in his campaign to win the white house . he has yet to provide specific details about his plans to carry out campaign promises on immigration but last week announced his intention to nominate sen. jeff sessions to lead the justice department .     sessions , like kobach , has helped trump craft his stance on immigration and is also a hard liner on the issue .     ___     associated press reporter john hanna in topeka , kansas , contributed to this report .\n"}], "dewei": [{"url": "file://test/43/1/1", "title": "test/43/1/1", "content": "a written plan for the department of homeland security brought by kansas secretary of state kris kobach into his meeting with president-elect donald trump spells out a desire to question \u201chigh-risk \u201d immigrants over support for sharia law and the u.s. constitution .     kobach , an early trump supporter , met with the president-elect on sunday and has been mentioned as a potential pick for a position within the administration . some speculation has centered on the secretary of homeland security , and kobach \u2019 s plan appears to lend credence to that possibility .     an associated press photographer shot an image of kobach going into the meeting and clutching a binder along with a stack of papers . one page is visible and readable , though partly obscured by kobach \u2019 s hand .     the document is arranged in a numbered format . the first point reads , \u201cbar the entry of potential terrorists. \u201d     the document calls for updating and reintroducing the national security entry-exit registration system . the program was implemented in the wake of the sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks , but largely suspended in 2011.     \u201call aliens from high-risk areas are tracked , \u201d the document reads .     the document mirrors what kobach told reuters in the days after the election . in an interview with the news service , he said an immigration policy group might recommend reinstating the nseers system , which would act as a registry of immigrants .     kobach was one of the original architects of the system , which was implemented under attorney general john ashcroft and president george w. bush .     the document then calls for \u201cextreme vetting questions \u201d for \u201chigh-risk aliens , \u201d echoing trump \u2019 s campaign rhetoric . high-risk aliens would be questioned about support for sharia law ( islamic religious law ) , jihad , the equality of men and women , and the u.s. constitution .     the document also asks for reducing the intake of syrian refugees to zero . in response , the american relief coalition for syria , a coalition of 13 syrian-american humanitarian organizations , said such a move would be \u201cdeeply immoral \u201d on the part of the united states .     the document contains obscured references to the arrest and removal of illegal aliens , \u201c386 miles of existing actual wall , \u201d the post-sept. 11 patriot act , and voter rolls . \u201cdraft amendments to national voter \u2014 \u201d can also be seen , perhaps a reference to the national voter registration act .     the rest of the page is either partially or totally obscured by kobach \u2019 s hand and arm . when the photograph was taken , kobach was standing outside with trump \u2014 it is highly unlikely kobach wasn \u2019 t aware he was being photographed .     a spokeswoman for kobach didn \u2019 t immediately respond to a request for comment .     \u201ckris is a really talented guy , \u201d gov . sam brownback said monday after he lit the statehouse christmas tree . \u201che \u2019 s done a great job as secretary of state . he \u2019 s a talented guy . i wish him all the best. \u201d     illegal immigration is a core passion for kobach . a high-level position in the trump administration would represent a culmination of his work on the subject and provide him a platform to enact the policies he for which he has advocated .     a 2015 profile of kobach in the wichita eagle traced his interest in immigration to the aftermath of 9/11 .     \u201cthey ( the hijackers ) successfully abused our immigration system , and much of my time at the justice department was occupied in trying to plug the holes that they had exploited in our system , \u201d kobach told the newspaper .     on monday , the council on american-islamic relations expressed alarm at kobach \u2019 s plan and the document \u2019 s proposal for what the organization called \u201cinquisition-style questions. \u201d yet spokesman ibrahim hooper said he wasn \u2019 t surprised .     \u201ci think this is unfortunately in line with the actions we \u2019 ve seen from president-elect trump \u2019 s transition team , \u201d hooper said .     micah kubic , director of the american civil liberties union of kansas , said kobach has a clear record of working to make voting more difficult , and life more difficult for immigrants . he said tools , such as the nseers , based on religious identity , are very concerning .     \u201call of that we find reprehensible , unconstitutional , illegal and un-american , \u201d kubic said .     a trump transition team statement on the sunday meeting said trump and kobach met \u201cto discuss border security , international terrorism , and reforming federal bureaucracy. \u201d     kobach has built a national reputation as a proponent of hard-line stances on immigration and election law . as kansas secretary of state , he is embroiled in litigation \u2013 defending the state \u2019 s proof of citizenship voting law .     kobach endorsed trump before the kansas gop caucus . he also said he was advising trump , including on the concept of building a wall and making mexico pay for it \u2014 a core plank of trump \u2019 s platform .     kansas senate minority leader anthony hensley , d-topeka , criticized kobach for openly carrying such a document .     \u201cthat \u2019 s the height of irony if he \u2019 s wanting a job in homeland security and you \u2019 re able to see in a photograph what should be confidential information , \u201d hensley said .     more recently , kobach has said he is advising trump \u2019 s transition efforts .     \u201che also hit themes you don \u2019 t normally see presidential candidates hitting on immigration . you \u2019 ll usually see them just grazing the surface and mentioning , \u2018ok , illegal immigration is a problem , america \u2019 s a country of immigrants , now let \u2019 s move on. \u2019 but what trump did was he really dove pretty deeply on a lot of topics , \u201d kobach said after trump delivered an immigration-focused address this fall .\n"}]}, "user_id_to_descriptions": {"alice": "Is interested in compiling a summary.", "hannah": "Knows about the
