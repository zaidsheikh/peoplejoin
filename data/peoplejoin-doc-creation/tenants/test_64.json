( associated press )     tokyo ( ap ) \u2014 conventional wisdom says that if north korea were ever to use its nuclear weapons , it would be an act of suicide . but brace yourself for what deterrence experts call the \" theory of victory . \"     to many who have studied how nuclear strategies actually work , it ' s conceivable north korea could escalate to a nuclear war and still survive . tuesday ' s missile test suggests once again it may be racing to prepare itself to do just that \u2014 but only if forced into a corner .     every missile north korean leader kim jong un launches comes at a high cost . north korea doesn ' t have an unlimited supply , and they aren ' t easy or cheap to build .     so when kim orders his strategic forces to launch , it ' s safe to assume it ' s a move calculated to achieve maximum political , technical and training value . tuesday ' s launch of a ballistic missile over japan and into the open pacific ocean , once again blowing past warnings from the united states and its allies , is a prime example .     there is a solid strategy hidden in each launch . from kim ' s perspective , here ' s what it looks like .     ___     how the north could survive     north korea has never suggested it would use its nuclear weapons to attack the united states or its allies completely out of the blue .     but , like washington , it has stated quite explicitly that if it is either attacked or has reason to believe an attack is imminent , it has the right to launch a retaliatory or even a pre-emptive first strike .     the trigger for north korea could be unusual troop movements in south korea , suspicious activity at u.s. bases in japan or \u2014 as the north has recently warned \u2014 flights near its airspace by u.s. air force b-1b bombers out of their home base on the island of guam .     if kim deemed any of those an imminent attack , one north korean strategy would be to immediately target u.s. bases in japan . a more violent move would be to attack a japanese city , such as tokyo , though that would probably be unnecessary since at this point the objective would be to weaken the u.s. military ' s command and control . going nuclear would send the strongest message , but chemical weapons would be an alternative .     north korea ' s ability to next hit the u.s. mainland with nuclear-tipped missiles is the key to how it would survive in this scenario . and that ' s why kim has been rushing to perfect and show them off to the world .     \" the whole reason they developed the icbm was to deter american nuclear retaliation because if you can hold an american city or cities at risk the american calculation always changes , \" said vipin narang , an associate professor of political science at the massachusetts institute of technology and a nuclear strategy specialist .     \" are we really willing to risk los angeles or chicago in retaliation for an attack on a u.s. military base in the region ? \" he asks . \" probably not . \"     that , right there , is kim ' s big wager .     if \" no \" actually is the answer , then north korea has a chance \u2014 though slim and risky \u2014 of staving off a full-scale conventional attack by the united states to survive another day .     ___     use ' em or lose ' em     kim isn ' t paranoid . he has good reason to fear an attack by the united states .     it ' s highly unlikely washington would unilaterally start a war . but if it did , north korea would face a far stronger and better equipped enemy able to \u2014 literally \u2014 bring the fight right to kim ' s front door . a successful u.s. first strike could within hours or days take out north korea ' s leadership , or at least seriously disrupt its chain of command , and destroy a good portion of the country ' s fighting power .     so north korea has a very strong incentive to escalate fast , before all is lost .     under kim il sung and kim jong il \u2014 kim ' s grandfather and father \u2014 north korea relied on conventional artillery just north of the demilitarized zone to keep washington at bay , figuring the u.s. wouldn ' t make any moves that might risk an attack on south korea ' s capital , seoul , and the tremendous casualties and destruction that would bring .     kim , fearing \" decapitation strikes , \" has brought missiles and nukes into the mix for an added layer of protection .     his strategy is to neutralize washington ' s military option by holding both seoul and an american city hostage while building up his own ability to withstand a first strike or a massive wave of retaliation . to do that , north korea is developing an array of missiles that can be launched by land or from submarines and easily hidden and transported to remote , hard-to-detect sites .     reasonably enough , countries with big arsenals are generally considered less likely to feel the need to use them or lose them .     north korea is believed to have an arsenal of perhaps several dozen nuclear weapons , growing by maybe a dozen or so each year . that ' s a lot , but some analysts believe it may take a few hundred to cure kim of the itchy trigger finger syndrome .     ___     the ' madman strategy '     in deterrence circles , ambiguity is considered a must . but confusion can be deadly .     in any confrontation , it ' s best that an opponent knows better than to cross the line \u2014 but not to know exactly where that line is . that fosters caution . confusion , on the other hand , creates the incentive to make a move either out of frightened self-defense or confident opportunism .     that ' s what north korea appears to be doing now , though it ' s not clear whether the motive is fear or arrogance .     over the past several weeks , u.s. president donald trump has promised fire , fury and power like the world has never seen should north korea issue even a vocal threat \u2014 which it did almost immediately , with no major consequences . trump ' s cabinet members walked that back , but in the process set or seemed to erase red lines of their own .     some have suggested this is a deliberate \" madman strategy . \"     inspired by the writings of machiavelli , president richard nixon gave this ploy a go against vietnam in the late 1960s . his idea was to make the vietnamese and their communist allies think that nixon would do anything , including use his nuclear weapons , to end the war .     but if trump is doing the same , he isn ' t doing it very well , narang said .     while kim ' s government speaks with one voice and maintains consistency , which is what gives the madman approach its credibility , it ' s \" really hard for trump to make these crazy statements and not have them walked back by someone in his administration . \"     \" at some point , \" narang said , \" the blurriness goes away and we just look incoherent . \"     ___     eric talmadge has been the ap ' s pyongyang bureau chief since 2013. follow him on twitter at erictalmadge and on instagram @erictalmadge .\n"}, {"url": "file://test/64/1/2", "title": "test/64/1/2", "content": "a day after north korea launched a missile over japan , tokyo bureau chief anna fifield answers one of the questions she gets most often about north korea : \" are we going to war ?

( shin takizawa/twitter )     \u201cthreatening and destabilizing actions only increase the north korean regime \u2019 s isolation in the region and among all nations of the world , \u201d he said . \u201call options are on the table. \u201d     the united states requested an emergency meeting of the u.n. security council , which this month unanimously approved the strictest economic sanctions to date on a nation that already is one of the most heavily sanctioned in the world .     \u201cno country should have missiles flying over them like those 130 million people in japan . it \u2019 s unacceptable , \u201d u.s. ambassador to the united nations nikki haley said .     north korea has \u201cviolated every single u.n. security council resolution that we \u2019 ve had , and so i think something serious has to happen , \u201d she added . \u201cenough is enough. \u201d     [ north korean missile flies over japan , prompting an angry response from tokyo ]     there was no indication that kim was intimidated by the white house reaction . the state korean central news agency reported wednesday morning local time that the north korean leader had been present for the missile launch and had called it \u201ca meaningful prelude to containing guam. \u201d according to the agency , kim said he had gone ahead with the missile launch because the united states proceeded with \u201cthe bellicose war exercises \u201d with south korea .     international outrage over the latest north korean missile went well beyond washington . trump spoke by phone with japanese prime minister shinzo abe hours after the launch , and the two leaders \u201ccommitted to increasing pressure on north korea , and doing their utmost to convince the international community to do the same , \u201d according to a white house statement .     people watch a television news screen showing file footage of a north korean missile launch , at a railway station in seoul on aug. 29 , 2017 . ( jung yeon-je/afp/getty images )     that was a reference to stiff international sanctions that so far have failed to stop north korea from developing working nuclear bombs and intercontinental ballistic missiles . the united states claims north korea could not evade those sanctions if other countries including china enforced them more stringently .     asked about the effectiveness of sanctions and international denunciation , given that north korea does not seem to care about the moves , deputy british u.n. envoy jonathan allen insisted such actions have merit .     \u201cthey send that really important message of the entire world being united , and they do have an impact on north korea , \u201d allen told reporters at the united nations .     the missile appeared to be a hwasong-12 , the intermediate-range ballistic missile that north korea has been threatening to shoot into the waters near the u.s. territory of guam .     but north korea did not shoot it southeast toward guam . instead , it lobbed the missile in a northeasterly direction , over japan and into the pacific ocean .     it was , as stephan haggard , a political scientist and korea expert at the university of california at san diego , described it , \u201cperfectly calibrated to create political mischief. \u201d     \u201cthe launch shows how kim jong un is weirdly conservative , calibrating tests so that they are difficult to counter , flying just beneath the radar of a required kinetic response , \u201d haggard said .     taro kono , japan \u2019 s foreign minister , acknowledged as much . \u201cif north korea had launched the missile to the south , the u.s. might have viewed it as a considerable provocation and responded accordingly , \u201d kono told reporters after the launch .     north korea \u2019 s action also seemed designed to drive a wedge between its neighbors .     in japan , abe called it \u201can unprecedented , grave and serious threat. \u201d abe wants to beef up japan \u2019 s military capabilities , and missile launches like this provide ammunition for his controversial cause . south korea \u2019 s liberal president , moon jae-in , who has promoted engagement with pyongyang , immediately denounced the launch and sent his fighter jets to drop bombs on a shooting range near the border with north korea .     both reactions appear to have rattled china , where officials called on all sides to take a step back . foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying characterized the north korea situation as \u201cat a tipping point , approaching a crisis. \u201d she repeated china \u2019 s call for talks between north korea and the united states .     [ north korea launches three missiles into sea , heightening tensions ]     tillerson had stressed sunday that the offer of talks remained open , and he encouraged kim to choose \u201ca different path. \u201d for weeks , u.s. officials have sought to assure kim that washington does not want to topple him or invade his country , a message also meant to appeal to north korea \u2019 s protector , china .     trump said last week that north korea was finally \u201cstarting to respect us , \u201d although he added that his threat to answer the country \u2019 s provocations with \u201cfire and fury \u201d might not have been strong enough .     tillerson also had publicly praised north korea last week for showing \u201crestraint \u201d since the u.n. security council vote and in the face of the annual military drills . although north korea had not test-launched any missiles for nearly a month at that point , it has done so twice since tillerson spoke .     north korea fired rockets over the japanese mainland in 1998 and 2009 \u2014 but it described them as satellite launch vehicles and gave japan advance warning in the second case . tuesday \u2019 s missile launch was purely military and \u201cdemonstrated a direct threat , \u201d said narushige michishita , an expert on korean peninsula security issues at the graduate institute for policy studies in tokyo .     \u201cfrom a military point of view , they have demonstrated an ability to use a very mobile , agile missile against targets anywhere in japan , \u201d he said .
