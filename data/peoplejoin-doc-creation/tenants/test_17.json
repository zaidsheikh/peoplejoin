insights from a longtime international political operative whose russian business partner has already been indicted in special counsel robert mueller \u2019 s probe .     the lobbyist , sam patten , 47 , admitted that he failed to register in the u.s. as a foreign agent for his work lobbying on behalf of a ukrainian political party . the nature of his cooperation isn \u2019 t clear . patten worked with manafort and on ukrainian campaigns , and reportedly worked on microtargeting operations with cambridge analytica .     mueller \u2019 s office referred the prosecution to u.s. attorney jessie liu in the district of columbia , according william miller , a spokesman for liu , who declined to comment about the nature of the cooperation or other matters relating to an ongoing investigation .     patten appeared in federal court in washington on friday .     patten \u2019 s plea agreement also included the suggestion that the trump inaugural committee improperly accepted funds from a foreigner . patten admitted that he illegally helped a ukrainian oligarch buy a ticket to trump \u2019 s swearing-in through a straw-man donor , though as part of his cooperation agreement he wasn \u2019 t charged .     a onetime state department official under president george w. bush , patten headed the moscow office of the international republican institute in the early 2000s . a russian employee of iri at the time , konstantin kilimnik , went on to work as a fixer for manafort in ukraine and is a business partner with patten .     kilimnik has been indicted in absentia alongside manafort on obstruction of justice charges . manafort , who was one of president donald trump \u2019 s campaign chairmen , was found guilty this month in alexandria , virginia , of tax and bank fraud charges and is being held in jail . he \u2019 s due to stand trial in washington next month on the obstruction charges as well as charges of money laundering and failure to register for his own lobbying work in ukraine .     manafort \u2019 s second trial looms , and there may still be third     patten entered his plea before u.s. district judge amy berman jackson , the same judge who \u2019 s overseeing manafort \u2019 s money-laundering and obstruction of justice trial in washington , scheduled to start next month .     watching from the gallery was andrew weissmann , an expert on money laundering and complex fraud cases who will be the lead prosecutor in manafort \u2019 s trial in washington . also in attendance was scott claffee , a trial lawyer in the justice department \u2019 s national security division .     from 2014 , patten provided a \u201cprominent \u201d ukrainian oligarch who isn \u2019 t named in court papers and his opposition bloc political party with lobbying and consulting services , according to the criminal information . a company patten co-owned with a russian national received more than $ 1 million for the work , the u.s. said .     details about the ukrainian oligarch match those of sergei lyovochkin , an opposition bloc leader whom prosecutors have previously identified as funding manafort \u2019 s work in ukraine . he couldn \u2019 t immediately been reached for comment .     as part of his lobbying work , patten violated the foreign agents registration act by not disclosing the work to the u.s. , prosecutors said . no date has been set for his sentencing .     cambridge analytica     patten worked for multiple political parties and office-holders in ukraine , according to his website . his work for cambridge analytica came during the 2014 election cycle , the daily beast reported in april . it was later adopted by \u201cat least one major u.s. presidential candidate , \u201d the daily beast said . patten told the publication that his work for cambridge analytica was separate from the work of his consulting firm .     cambridge analytica files u.s. bankruptcy after data scandal     patten formed a consulting firm in 2015 with kilimnik , whom mueller indicted in june . kilimnik has been identified in filings as having worked for the russian military \u2019 s intelligence service known as the gru . one filing cited an fbi assessment that his relations to the gru continued through the 2016 election , which kilimnik has denied .     the firm that the two set up , begemot ventures international ltd. , listed patten and kilimnik as the sole officers , according to its washington , d.c. , incorporation records . the company \u2019 s website describes it as \u201ca strategic and political advisory firm that helps its clients win elections , strengthen political parities , build the right arguments before domestic and international audiences and achieve better results. \u201d     begemot , which is russian for behemoth , matches details of the unidentified firm that prosecutors say received cash for patten \u2019 s ukraine work .     patten registered with congress in 2016 to lobby for a group called the committee to destroy isis , which was financed in part by a jordanian construction company , according to disclosures filed with the senate office of public records . he disclosed payments of $ 50,000 and stopped lobbying for the group in july .     it \u2019 s unclear why mueller referred the case . previously , he referred information about trump \u2019 s former personal lawyer michael cohen to the u.s. attorney in manhattan . in july , deputy attorney general rod rosenstein said the justice department \u2019 s national security division would take over responsibility of a case filed against a dozen russian military intelligence officers accused of hacking into the democratic national committee and hillary clinton \u2019 s campaign .     \u201cit may have to do with the size of the case , the nature of the case , the resources needed for the case , \u201d said mike koenig , a former justice department prosecutor .     the senate intelligence committee made a separate criminal referral to the justice department based on statements and documents provided by patten , the committee \u2019 s chairman , senator richard burr of north carolina ,

michael arnold as he searches the ocean for debris in the search zone in the southern indian ocean for the missing malaysian airlines flight mh370 in this picture released by the australian defence force april 8 , 2014.     sydney/perth , australia ( reuters ) - an australian ship which picked up possible \" pings \" from the black box recorders of a missing malaysia airlines jetliner has been unable to detect any further signals and time is running out to narrow the massive search , officials said on tuesday .     angus houston , head of the australian agency coordinating the search for malaysia airlines flight mh370 , said the month-long hunt in the indian ocean was at a critical stage given the batteries in the black box beacons had already reached the end of their 30-day expected life .     a u.s. navy \" towed pinger locator \" onboard australia ' s ocean shield picked up two signals consistent with black box locator beacons over the weekend - the first for more than two hours and the second for about 13 minutes .     houston said the signals represented the best lead in the search yet , but efforts to pick up the pings again had so far been unsuccessful .     \" if we don ' t get any further transmissions , we have a reasonably large search area of the bottom of the ocean to prosecute and that will take a long , long time . it ' s very slow , painstaking work , \" said houston .     the black boxes record cockpit data and may provide answers about what happened to the plane , which was carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew when it vanished on march 8 and flew thousands of kilometers off its kuala lumpur-to-beijing route .     authorities say evidence , including the loss of communications , suggests the plane was deliberately diverted by someone familiar with the aircraft , but have not ruled out mechanical problems .     analysis of satellite data led investigators to conclude the boeing 777 came down in an area some 1,680 km ( 1,040 miles ) northwest of perth , near where possible pings were picked up and the search is now focused .     bluefin on hold     an autonomous underwater vehicle ( auv ) named bluefin-21 is onboard the ocean shield and could be sent to look for wreckage on the sea floor , but narrowing the search zone first was critical , houston said .     \" it is a large area for a small submersible that has a very narrow field of search , and of course , it is literally crawling along the bottom of the ocean , \" he said .     \" that ' s why it ' s so important to get another transmission and we need to continue until there ' s absolutely no chance the ( black box ) device is still transmitting . \"     the bluefin will scour the ocean floor in 20-hour missions using sonar in an attempt to find the aircraft , before its findings are downloaded and analyzed on board the ocean shield .     if anything unusual is spotted , the sonar on board the robotic vehicle will be replaced with a camera to take a closer look . the potential search area is about 4.5 km ( 2.8 miles ) deep , the outer reach of the bluefin ' s range .     some 133 missions have been completed so far in the multinational aerial hunt for debris in the southern indian ocean and would continue , officials said .     up to 11 military planes , three civilian planes and 14 ships planned to take part in the search on tuesday , with good weather in the search area . but so far , searchers have only turned up fishing gear and other detritus .     \" even after the black box is found , the surface search will continue because they ' re looking for evidence to investigate why the aircraft went down , \" lieutenant commander adam schantz , the officer in charge of u.s. navy p-8 poseidon search unit , told

for the missing malaysia airlines jet have failed to relocate faint sounds heard deep below the southern indian ocean that officials said were consistent with a plane ' s black boxes , the head of the search operation said tuesday .     angus houston , the retired australian air chief marshal who is heading the search far off australia ' s west coast , said sound locating equipment on board the ocean shield has picked up no trace of the signals since they were first heard late saturday and early sunday .     time may have already run out to find the devices , whose locator beacons have a battery life of about a month . tuesday marks one month since the plane vanished . once the beacons blink off , locating the black boxes in such deep water would be an immensely difficult , if not impossible , task .     up to 14 planes and 14 ships are scouring the 30,000-square-mile search zone .     the wait has been devastating for weary families , cbs news correspondent seth doane reports . many insist the search continues at all costs , despite the frustrations .     it is unclear whether a sub on board the ocean shield will be deployed to try to chart out any debris on the sea floor when searchers are certain the black boxes ' locator beacons have gone silent . if the sub maps out a debris field , the crew will replace the sonar system with a camera unit to photograph any wreckage .         houston ' s comments about deploying the sub contradicted an earlier statement from australia ' s acting prime minister , warren truss , who said search crews would launch the bluefin 21 autonomous sub on tuesday .     the towed pinger locator detected late saturday and early sunday two distinct , long-lasting sounds underwater that are consistent with the pings from an aircraft ' s \" black boxes \" - the flight data and cockpit voice recorders , houston said , dubbing the find a promising lead in the month-long hunt for clues to the plane ' s fate .     still , officials warned it could take days to determine whether the sounds were connected to flight 370 , which vanished march 8 on a flight from kuala lumpur , malaysia , to beijing with 239 on board .     \" this is an herculean task - it ' s over a very , very wide area , the water is extremely deep , \" defense minister david johnston said . \" we have at least several days of intense action ahead of us . \"     houtson said finding the sound again was critical to narrowing down the search area before the sub can be used . if the vehicle went down now with the sparse data collected so far , it would take \" many , many days \" for it to cover all the places the pings might have come from .     \" it ' s literally crawling at the bottom of the ocean , so it ' s going to take a long , long time , \" houston said .     despite the excitement surrounding the ocean shield ' s sound detections , houston warned that the search had previously been marred by false leads - such as ships detecting their own signals . because of that , other ships cannot be sent in to help with the underwater search , as they may add unwanted noise .     \" we ' re very hopeful we will find further evidence that will confirm the aircraft is in that location , \" houston said . \" there ' s still a little bit of doubt there , but i ' m a lot more optimistic than i was one week ago . \"     finding the black boxes is key to unraveling what happened to the boeing 777 , because they contain flight data and cockpit voice recordings that could explain why the plane veered so far off-course .     \" everyone ' s anxious about the life of the batteries on the black box flight recorders , \" said truss , who is acting prime minister while tony abbott is overseas . \" sometimes they go on for many , many weeks longer than they ' re mandated to operate for - we hope that ' ll be the case in this instance . but clearly there is an aura of urgency about the investigation . \"     the first sound picked up by the equipment on board the ocean shield lasted two hours and 20 minutes before it was lost , houston said . the ship then turned around and picked up a signal again - this time recording two distinct \" pinger returns \" that lasted 13 minutes . that would be consistent with transmissions from both the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder .     the black boxes normally emit a frequency of 37.5 kilohertz , and the signals picked up by the ocean shield were both 33.3 kilohertz , u.s. navy capt . mark matthews said . but the manufacturer indicated the frequency of black boxes can drift in older equipment .     houston said the frequency of the sounds heard was considered \" quite credible \" by the manufacturer , and noted that the frequency from the air france jet that crashed several years ago was 34 kilohertz . pressure from being so deep below the surface and the age of the batteries can also affect the transmission level , he said .     the frequency used by aircraft flight recorders was chosen because no other devices use it , and because nothing in the natural world mimics it , said william waldock , a search-and-rescue expert who teaches accident investigation at embry-riddle aeronautical university in prescott , ariz.     but these signals are being detected by computer sweeps , and \" not so much a guy with headphones on listening to pings , \" said u.s. navy spokesman chris johnson . so until the signals are fully analyzed , it ' s too early to say what they are , he said .     \" we ' ll hear lots of signals at different frequencies , \" he said . \" marine mammals . our own ship systems . scientific equipment , fishing equipment , things like that . and then of course there are lots of ships operating in the area that are all radiating certain signals into the ocean . \"     the ocean shield is dragging a ping locator at a depth of 1.9 miles . it is designed to detect signals at a range of 1.12 miles , meaning it would need to be almost on top of the recorders to detect them if they were on the ocean floor , which is about 2.8 miles deep .     meanwhile , the search for any trace of the plane on the ocean ' s surface continued tuesday . it is taking place 1,400 miles northwest of the australian west coast city of perth , with good weather predicted , said the joint agency coordination center , which is overseeing the operation .     one-hundred-thirty-three missions have been completed so far in the hunt from the air for debris that could be from flight 370 , but no debris from the plane
