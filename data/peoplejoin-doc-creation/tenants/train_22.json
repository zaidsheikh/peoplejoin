the athlete , she wrote : \u201cto look at him now , he ' s a pathetic figure . he looks haunted . he ' s already been punished in a way .     \u201cwhatever is in his head is in his head forever . he will have to live with that. \u201d     pistorius was sentenced to prison for five years for the culpable homicide of steenkamp . he shot her through a locked toilet door in his pretoria home on february 14 , 2013 , thinking she was an intruder .     sunday times reported that june steenkamp wrote that she did not believe pistorius ' s version .     \u201che said pulling the trigger was ' an accident ' . what ? four times an accident ? he said reeva did not scream , but she would definitely have screamed . i know my daughter as she was very vocal , \u201d she wrote .     \u201cthere is no

\u2019 s \u201cbad luck \u201d conspired against her .     in the seven-month trial , pistorius was cleared of murdering his girlfriend , reeva , but found guilty of culpable homicide and sentenced to five years in prison .     in an interview with the times magazine , june steenkamp describes pistorius as : \u201cmoody \u201d , \u201cvolatile \u201d , \u201carrogant \u201d , \u201ccombustible

steenkamp claimed that pistorius had shot her daughter \u201cin a jealous rage , then finished her off with three more bullets so she \u2018couldn \u2019 t tell the world what really happened \u2019 . \u201d     she said her daughter \u2019 s death haunts her at night \u2013 she regularly wakes up around 3am , the time reeva died at pistorius \u2019 s home .     \u201cwhy decide to say sorry to me in a televised trial in front of the whole world ? i was unmoved by his apology , \u201d she writes .     \u201ci felt if i appeared to be sorry for him at this stage of his trial on the charge of premeditated murder , it would , in the eyes of others , lessen the awfulness of what he had done. \u201d     meanwhile a snippet and photos have been published on hello \u2019 s website , announcing

the magazine : \u201cit \u2019 s been a terrible , long journey \u201d .     \u201che was almost resigned to what was coming . it was obvious in the court from his manner ; he was calm and wasn \u2019 t performing , \u201d she said .     she said she and her husband were still coming to terms with \u201cthe vision of reeva suffering this terrible trauma \u201d .     blood-splattered images of the crime scene were exhibited during the pistorius trial .     steenkamp added : \u201cwe \u2019 re not looking for vengeance or for him to get hurt ; we \u2019 re just happy because he \u2019 s going to be punished for what he \u2019 s done .     \u201che may come out early on good behaviour , but by the time he \u2019 s served that time , it will have taught him that he can \u2019 t go around doing things like that. \u201d     his five-year sentence has been criticised by some as too lenient .     but reeva \u2019 s parents told itv \u2019 s good morning britain they accepted the sentence and \u201cdon \u2019 t want revenge \u201d . they said their daughter \u2019 s valentine \u2019 s day death last year remained shrouded in mystery , and \u201conly oscar knows \u201d the truth .     after

"file://train/22/2/0", "title": "train/22/2/0", "content": "the aim of this study was to investigate the size of the association between deficiencies in social relationships and incident coronary heart disease ( chd ) or stroke , the two greatest causes of burden of disease in high-income countries . 10 we conducted a systematic review to answer the following primary question : are deficiencies in social relationships associated with developing chd and stroke in high-income countries ? our secondary objectives included investigating whether loneliness or social isolation was differentially associated with incident heart disease and stroke , and whether the association between social relationships and disease incidence varied according to age , gender , marital status , socioeconomic position , ethnicity and health .     researchers have identified three main pathways through which social relationships may affect health : behavioural , psychological and physiological mechanisms . 3 , 4 health-risk behaviours associated with loneliness and social isolation include physical inactivity and smoking . 5 loneliness is linked to lower self-esteem and limited use of active coping methods , 6 while social isolation predicts decline in self-efficacy . 7 feeling lonely or being socially isolated is associated with defective immune functioning and higher blood pressure . 8 , 9 this evidence suggests that loneliness and social isolation may be important risk factors for developing disease , and that addressing them would benefit public health and well-being .     adults who have few social contacts ( ie , who are socially isolated ) or feel unhappy about their social relationships ( ie , who are lonely ) are at increased risk of premature mortality . 1 the influence of social relationships on mortality is comparable with well-established risk factors , including physical activity and obesity . 2 yet , compared with our understanding of these risk factors , we know much less about the implications of loneliness and social isolation for disease aetiology .     finally , sensitivity analyses were performed to test whether our overall results were affected by internal study validity and small-study effects . contour-enhanced funnel plots for asymmetry were drawn using stata v.12 ( stata statistical software : release 12 [ program ] . college station , tx : statacorp lp , 2011 ) . the limited number and the heterogeneity of studies did not support the use of tests for funnel plot asymmetry . 20     potential sources of variation were explored with prespecified subgroup analyses . since heterogeneity could not be explained and removed based on these analyses , but we deemed studies sufficiently similar to warrant aggregation , we combined results using random effects models . this approach allows for between-study variation , and is consistent with our assumption that the effects estimated in the different studies were not identical , since they investigated different dimensions of social relationships and derived from different populations .     patterns identified in the preliminary synthesis were formally investigated . only papers for which an effect estimate and se or ci were available ( reported in the paper or provided by contacted authors ) , or could be calculated , contributed to this stage of the analysis . where several papers reported results from the same cohort , we privileged the findings with the longest follow-up time . if a study included multiple measures of exposure and/or outcome , we selected the result relating to the most comprehensive measure . where a study used statistical controls to calculate an effect size , we extracted data from the most complex model to minimise risk of confounding . all effect sizes were transformed to the natural log for analyses . using revman v.5.3 ( review manager ( revman ) version 5.3 [ program ] . copenhagen : the nordic cochrane centre , 2014 ) , chd and stroke effect estimates were plotted in separate forest plots , and heterogeneity between studies was assessed using the i 2 statistic .     we hypothesised that social relationships were associated with disease incidence , and that this association may differ according to the dimension of relationships measured , and individual-level and contextual-level factors . a preliminary synthesis was developed by grouping study characteristics and results according to their measure of relationships . the majority of papers reported relative hazards of new diagnosis , comparing people with higher versus lower levels of loneliness or social isolation . since incidence of disease was low ( <10 % ) in the three studies reporting ors , these estimates were approximated to relative risks . 19 where the lonely or isolated group was used as the reference , results were transformed to allow comparison across studies .     based on the agency for healthcare research and quality framework and taxonomy of threats to validity and precision , 16 we selected the following domains as relevant for assessing studies : sampling bias , non-response bias , missing data , differential loss to follow-up , information error with regard to exposure and outcome measure , detection bias , confounding and study size . we identified age , gender and socioeconomic status as potential confounders ( ie , factors correlated with exposure , predictive of outcome and not on the causal pathway ) . 17 , 18 no studies were excluded due to quality ; instead , subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed , to test the stability of findings according to internal validity .     after removing duplicates , two researchers independently screened titles and abstracts before assessing full records using a standardised screening sheet . additional information was sought from authors when necessary ( 3 ( 60 % ) responded ) . when authors did not reply , we searched for information from related publications to inform our decision .     to complement the electronic search , we screened reference lists , searched for citations in scopus ( the largest database of abstracts and citations ) and contacted topic experts identified through the uk campaign to end loneliness \u2019 research hub .     we searched 16 electronic databases for published and grey literature published up until may 2015 : medline , embase , cinahl plus , psycinfo , assia , web of science , cochrane library , social policy and practice , national database of ageing research , open grey , hmic , ethos , ndltd , nhs evidence , scie and national institute for health and care excellence ( nice ) . thesaurus and free text terms ( eg , loneliness , social isolation , social relationships , social support , social network ) were combined with filters for observational study designs and tailored to each database . the search strategy included no health terms , as it aimed to capture all disease outcomes , rather than focus on chd and stroke . for the full electronic strategy used to search medline , see online supplementary appendix 1.     to meet inclusion criteria , studies had to investigate new chd and/or stroke diagnosis at the individual level as a function of loneliness and/or social isolation . we defined chd as encompassing the diagnoses listed under codes l20 \u2013 l25 of the 10th revision of the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems ( icd-10 ) , and stroke as icd-10 codes i60 \u2013 69 . we excluded studies where chd or stroke diagnosis was not the first instance of diagnosis among participants , except where analyses controlled for previous events . we applied no other exclusion criteria regarding study population . measures of social relationships met inclusion criteria for loneliness if they were consistent with its definition as a subjective negative feeling associated with someone ' s perception that their relationships with others are deficient . 13 measures of social isolation had to be consistent with its definition as a more objective measure of the absence of relationships , ties or contact with others . 14 we focused on longitudinal studies in order to investigate the temporal relationships between loneliness or isolation and subsequent disease . our purpose was to clarify the public health challenge posed by deficiencies in social relationships in high-income countries , 15 so we excluded all other settings . we applied no language , publication type or date restrictions to inclusion .     results     a total of 23 studies based on 16 cohorts were identified for inclusion in the review , after a two-stage process . see figure 1 for a flow diagram of the study selection process . eleven studies on chd and eight studies on stroke met inclusion criteria for the quantitative syntheses ( ie , studies based on independent samples reporting data from which the natural log of the estimate and its se could derived ) .     figure 1 preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses ( prisma ) flow diagram . chd , coronary heart disease .

2.8 % 40 to 77.2 % .31 three papers measured loneliness,21 ,30 ,42 18 measured social isolation22 \u2013 43 and two papers used a measure combining both dimensions.34 ,35 the three papers on loneliness used different tools : a direct question asking about loneliness feelings during the day,30 a question on feelings of loneliness in the past week42 and a 13-item tool encompassing the perceived availability , adequacy or accessibility of social relationships.21 across the 18 studies on social isolation , 11 tools were used : six studies used the berkman \u2013 syme social network index,44 two studies used the 10-item lubben social network scale45 and the remainder used nine different tools on the availability and/or frequency of contacts . one cohort study used a measure combining social isolation and loneliness , the 11-item duke social support index , which asks about frequency of interaction and satisfaction with relationships.46 loneliness and social isolation were predominantly treated as a categorical variable ; two studies analysed them as continuous variables.29 ,42 only one study reported results based on measuring social relationships more than once.42     ascertainment of chd and stroke a total of 4628 chd and 3002 stroke events were recorded across the 23 papers . eighteen studies measured incident chd and 10 measured stroke ( five studies reported on both outcomes ) . diagnosis was ascertained from medical records , death certificates or national registers in all but four studies . others used self-report,34 ,35 or telephone interviews with a nurse or physician.33 two studies verified self-reported events against medical records.29 ,36 ,38 the majority of studies with a measure of chd focused on myocardial infarction and/or chd death ( 11/18 ) . four studies included angina pectoris within their measure of chd and two presented results for angina separately . the remit of the chd measure was unclear in one study.43     study validity figure 2 summarises risk of bias across the studies included in our review ( see online supplementary appendix 3 for details of criteria ) . for many of the instruments assessing social relationships , information on reliability and validity was limited ( online supplementary appendix 4 displays detailed information on the validity and reliability of tools ) . four cohorts ( six articles ) relied on subjects reporting new diagnosis for all or part of the outcomes measured , and were judged to be at greater risk of misclassification ( see online supplementary appendix 2 for details of outcome assessment ) . limited information on attrition and blinding of outcome assessment meant that susceptibility to differential loss to follow-up and detection bias was unclear . we note that the multiplicity of risk factors investigated and the differential length of follow-up suggest that outcome assessment is unlikely to have been influenced by knowledge of baseline information on social relationships . supplementary appendix 3 [ heartjnl-2015-308790supp_appendix3.pdf ] supplementary appendix 4 [ heartjnl-2015-308790supp_appendix4.pdf ] figure 2 internal validity

,33 ,36 ,37 ,39 ,40 ,42 ,43 four studies presented results from univariate analyses,31 ,34 ,35 ,41 with a further study adjusting for age only.26 the remaining eight reports did not control for socioeconomic status , although in the case of the health professionals follow-up study the relative socioeconomic homogeneity of the sample may limit the impact of this omission.22 ,24     loneliness , social isolation and chd across 11 studies ( 3794 events ; one study did not report numbers ) based on independent samples , the average relative risk of new chd when comparing high versus low loneliness or social isolation was 1.29 ( 95 % ci 1.04 to 1.59 ; see figure 3 ) . we found evidence of heterogeneity within this comparison ( i2=66 % , \u03c72=29.16 , df=10 , p=0.001 ) and explored whether this could be explained by social relationship domain ( loneliness vs social isolation ) , gender , risk of confounding and higher risk of bias due to exposure measurement error . we found no evidence that effects differed according to each subgroup ( see online supplementary appendix 5 ) . we were not able to explore other potential sources of heterogeneity due to limited information and study numbers . supplementary appendix 5 [ heartjnl-2015-308790supp_appendix5.pdf ] figure 3 forest plot of studies investigating incident chd . chd , coronary heart disease .     social isolation and stroke across nine independent study samples ( 2577 events ; one study did not report numbers ) , the average relative risk of stroke incidence was 1.32 ( 95 % ci 1.04 to 1.68 ; see figure 4 ) . following confirmation of heterogeneity ( i2=53 % , \u03c72=17.07 , df=8 , p=0.03 ) we performed subgroup analyses according to risk of confounding and risk of bias due to outcome measurement error ( there were too few studies to perform any other analyses ) . there was no evidence of effects differing according to subgroup ( see online supplementary appendix 6 ) ; we had insufficient information to explore other potential sources of heterogeneity . supplementary appendix 6 [ heartjnl-2015-308790supp_appendix6.pdf ] figure 4 forest plot of studies investigating incident stroke .     risk of bias across studies to test whether our findings were sensitive to internal study validity , we compared results with and without studies at greater risk of bias . we found no evidence of a difference in the ratio of the relative risks for chd and stroke according to study validity ( see table 2 ) . table 2 sensitivity analyses visual assessment of contour-enhanced funnel plots suggested that studies might be missing in areas of statistical significance ( see figure 5a , b ) . comparing fixed-effects and random-effects estimates , we found the random-effects estimate to be more beneficial ( chd : relative risk ( rr ) random-effects : 1.29 , 95 % ci 1.04 to 1.59 , compared with rr fixed-effects : 1.18 , 95 % ci 1.06 to 1.31 ; stroke : rr , random-effects : 1.32 , 95 % ci 1.04 to 1.68 , compared with rr fixed-effects : 1.19 , 95 % ci 1.03 to 1.36 ) . this suggests the presence of small-study effects , which could be due to reporting bias . although we found no evidence that study
