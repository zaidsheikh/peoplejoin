capturing the mood of a significant chunk of the electorate , with a remarkable 4 in 10 voters in exit polls expressing support for the movement .     but in the senate , the effect was exactly what establishment republicans had feared : while tea party energy powered some victories , concerns about tea party extremism also cost them what could have been easy gains \u2014 most notably in nevada , where the senate democratic leader , harry reid , survived a challenge from sharron angle , a tea party favorite .     now , as it tries to make the transition from a protest movement to a power on capitol hill , the tea party faces the challenge of channeling the energy it brought to the election into a governing agenda when it has no clear mandate , a stated distaste for the inevitable compromises of legislating , and a wary relationship with republican leaders in congress .     for many voters the tea party has been a blank screen on which they have projected all kinds of hopes and frustrations \u2014 not always compatible or realistic .     to many in the movement , the singular goal is to stop an expanding government in its tracks , to \u201chold the line at all hazards , \u201d as jennifer stefano , a tea party leader in pennsylvania , put it .     but the movement is also animated by a belief that the entire political system has become disconnected from the practical needs and values of americans , suggesting that its voting power stemmed as much from a populist sense of outrage in a tough economic moment as it did from ideology . what many of its adherents want as much as anything is for the two parties to come together to solve problems .     that sometimes conflicting mandate was neatly captured by two interviews in searchlight , nev. , hometown of mr. reid , who became the tea party \u2019 s biggest target . \u201ci want to see gridlock , \u201d said ronald hanvey , who supported ms. angle . \u201ci don \u2019 t want to see any more laws. \u201d     a few months earlier on nearly the same spot , jeff church , arriving at a tea party rally against mr. reid , complained equally about the state \u2019 s republican senator , john ensign , and yearned for bipartisanship . \u201cwhy can \u2019 t they get along and make some common-sense solutions ? \u201d mr. church asked .     in the senate , the tea party carried to victory marco rubio in florida and rand paul in kentucky . still , it cost the republicans some seats that they had once counted as solid , including one in delaware , where christine o \u2019 donnell , who beat an establishment candidate in the primary thanks to strong tea party support , lost to chris coons , a democrat once considered a long shot .     even more painful for republicans was the result in nevada . mr. reid , once considered the most vulnerable democrat , fought off ms. angle , who had made headlines for her controversial and sometimes eccentric remarks .     house races showed the same win-loss effect .     looking ahead , the immediate focus for the movement will be on the big legislative issues facing congress . but as attention inevitably shifts to 2012 , the tea party will also have the chance to exert potentially substantial influence on the race for the republican presidential nomination , with a variety of potential candidates , including sarah palin and senator jim demint of south carolina , maneuvering to lead it into the next election .     for the republican congressional leaders , representative john a. boehner of ohio and senator mitch mcconnell of kentucky , the question is whether the passion of the tea party translates into an agenda that can drive legislative progress in a divided capital , or whether it becomes a prod to block mr. obama and his party at every turn . they want to keep the movement \u2019 s energy alive through the next presidential election \u2014 but not fall captive to it .     a year spent observing the contours of tea party america revealed an uneasy alliance within it , between those who came to the movement with unswerving ideology , generally libertarian , and those who say they came to it more out of frustration and a desire to feel that they were doing something to move forward when the country seemed stuck .     the much-mocked sign at a health care town hall last summer , \u201ckeep your government hands off my medicare , \u201d suggested how many tea party supporters had come to the movement without thinking through the specifics . while the more ideological tea party supporters embrace ideas like phasing out social security and medicare in favor of private savings accounts , most do not .     and just as tea party supporters do not always agree on what the agenda is , most americans disagree with many of the goals proclaimed by tea party candidates .     while incoming tea party lawmakers like mr. paul have advocated sharp across-the-board cuts in federal spending , a pew research center poll last week found that a plurality of americans disapproved of a proposal to freeze all government spending except the part that goes to national security . a majority disapproved of permanently extending the bush-era tax cuts on incomes greater than $ 250,000 .     a new york times/cbs news poll last month similarly found opposition to raising the retirement age or reducing social security or medicare benefits for future retirees . and a plurality of voters disagreed with what is perhaps the tea party movement \u2019 s most widely supported goal : repealing the health care overhaul passed in march .     even where the public agrees on parts of the republican-tea party agenda , there are important qualifiers . a slight majority in the pew poll approved of changing social security to allow private accounts , but only by the same margin as when president george w. bush advanced the cause in 2005 , only to see it fail when people read the fine print .     the most ardent tea party activists expect republicans to hew to their desires .     even before polls closed tuesday , freedomworks , the libertarian advocacy group that has helped shape the movement from its earliest hours , put out a press release declaring , \u201cthe success of the g.o.p . will not merely benefit from the tea party vote , it will depend on it. \u201d     david adams , a tea party activist in kentucky who ran mr. paul \u2019 s primary campaign , said , \u201ci \u2019 m hoping for a lot of fireworks in washington over who takes control of who .     \u201cif republican leaders think for a minute that they \u2019 re going to suck us in and continue business as usual , \u201d he said , \u201cthey \u2019 re wrong. \u201d     like many other tea party supporters , mr. adams said the biggest goals are to balance the budget and reduce the national debt . and on those , it was unclear where he was willing to compromise . he expects lawmakers like mr. paul who campaigned on a promise to balance the federal budget within a year and pass a balanced budget amendment to the constitution to put forward proposals to do so . it would not be enough , mr. adams said , to reach an agreement to , say , balance the budget over five years .     mr. adams \u2019 s list also includes changing social security and medicare , cutting the military budget , replacing the income tax with a flat tax \u2014 all ideas that have been raised and voted down , firmly , before . as for repealing the health care legislation ? \u201ci can \u2019 t imagine much compromise there , \u201d he said .     \u201cyou look at what the tea party has done over the course of this last year , we \u2019 ve changed the shape of the debate , \u201d he said . \u201cwe have major candidates who are winning races by large margins by talking about making government smaller . we \u2019 re getting very , very close to put-up-or-shut-up time. \u201d     there was not much room for compromise on ms. stefano \u2019 s list , either . she wants the health care bill and the estate tax to be repealed , and the bush-era tax cuts to be made permanent .     she warned republicans not to read too much into the tea party support for republicans . \u201cthey should not see it as a mandate for their agenda , \u201d she said . \u201cit is a repudiation of the president and nancy pelosi \u2019 s view of america . as far as i \u2019 m concerned , as of nov. 3 , the republicans are on probation. \u201d     but as much as the tea party allowed the republicans to win in enthusiasm , it will still have a relatively small caucus in the house and the senate . with control of congress split , republicans will have to work with democrats to get things done . tea party lawmakers who refuse to go along may find they become irrelevant \u2014 certainly not the goal of all the noise and passion of the last two years .\n"}, {"url": "file://train/47/2/4", "title": "train/47/2/4", "content": "abstract     the blacklegged tick , ixodes scapularis say , is the primary vector to humans in the eastern united states of the lyme disease spirochete borrelia burgdorferi , as well as causative agents of anaplasmosis and babesiosis . its close relative in the far western united states , the western blacklegged tick ixodes pacificus cooley and kohls , is the primary vector to humans in that region of the lyme disease and anaplasmosis agents . since 1991 , when standardized surveillance and reporting began , lyme disease case counts have increased steadily in number and in geographical distribution in the eastern united states . similar trends have been observed for anaplasmosis and babesiosis . to better understand the changing landscape of risk of human exposure to disease agents transmitted by i. scapularis and i. pacificus , and to document changes in their recorded distribution over the past two decades , we updated the distribution of these species from a map published in 1998. the presence of i. scapularis has now been documented from 1,420 ( 45.7 % ) of the 3,110 continental united states counties , as compared with 111 ( 3.6 % ) counties for i. pacificus . combined , these vectors of b. burgdorferi and other disease agents now have been identified in a total of 1,531 ( 49.2 % ) counties spread across 43 states . this marks a 44.7 % increase in the number of counties that have recorded the presence of these ticks since the previous map was presented in 1998 , when 1,058 counties in 41 states reported the ticks to be present . notably , the number of counties in which i. scapularis is considered established ( six or more individuals or one or more life stages identified in a single year ) has more than doubled since the previous national distribution map was published nearly two decades ago . the majority of county status changes occurred in the north-central and northeastern states , whereas the distribution in the south remained fairly stable . two previously distinct foci for i. scapularis in the northeast and north-central states appear to be merging in the ohio river valley to form a single contiguous focus . here we document a shifting landscape of risk for human exposure to medically important ticks and point to areas of re-emergence where enhanced vector surveillance and control may be warranted .     the blacklegged tick , ixodes scapularis say , is the primary vector to humans in the eastern united states of the lyme disease spirochete borrelia burgdorferi , as well as the relapsing fever spirochete , borrelia miyamotoi ; causative agents of anaplasmosis ( anaplasma phagocytophilum ) and babesiosis ( babesia microti ) ; and powassan encephalitis virus ( piesman and eisen 2008 , ebel 2010 , krause et al . 2015 ) . its close relative in the far western united states , the western blacklegged tick ixodes pacificus cooley and kohls , is the primary vector to humans in that region of lyme disease and anaplasmosis agents , as well as relapsing fever spirochetes ( b. miyamotoi ; lane et al . 1994 , teglas and foley 2006 , krause et al . 2015 ) . lyme disease is the most commonly reported vector-borne disease in the united states . it is a geographically focal illness , with the majority of cases reported from the northeastern and north-central states and discrete areas of risk in the pacific coast states ( mead 2015 ) . since 1991 , when standardized surveillance and reporting began , lyme disease case counts have increased steadily from roughly 10,000 cases in 1991 to more than 30,000 cases in 2008 and subsequent years ( bacon et al . 2008 , mead 2015 ) ; the true burden of disease is estimated to be roughly 10-fold greater ( hinckley et al . 2014 , nelson et al . 2015 ) . in addition to the increase in case counts over time , the geographical foci of high-incidence counties have expanded both in the north-central and in the northeastern united states ( kugeler et al . 2015 ) .     rising case counts and geographical expansion of lyme disease endemic areas have been attributed to range expansion of i. scapularis in the eastern united states ( bacon et al . 2008 , rydzewski et al . 2012 , lee et al . 2013 , brinkerhoff et al . 2014 , robinson et al . 2014 , wang et al . 2014 , khatchikian et al . 2015 , kugeler et al . 2015 , stone et al . 2015 ) . however , because of a lack of systematic surveillance of i. scapularis and i. pacificus , national trends in the geographic distribution of these medically important ticks are difficult to document . to better understand the changing landscape of risk of human exposure to i. scapularis and i. pacificus in the united states , and to document changes in their distribution over the past two decades , we updated the reported distribution of these species from the map previously published by dennis et al . ( 1998 ) .     materials and methods     county status definitions     the definitions used to classify i. scapularis or i. pacificus as \u201cestablished \u201d or \u201creported \u201d in a county follow dennis et al . ( 1998 ) . counties were classified as established if at least six individual ticks or at least two of the three host-seeking life stages had been identified in a single collection period . here , a single collection period is defined as a single year . counties were classified as reported if they failed to meet the criteria for established but if at least one tick of any life stage had been identified at any time in that county , or if county records did not specify the number of ticks or life stages collected . lack of tick records from a county \u2014 \u201cno records \u201d \u2014 does not imply that ticks are absent from that county , only that records of ticks having been collected in the county are lacking .     the county status ( i.e. , established , reported , or no records ) given by dennis et al . ( 1998 ) was used as the basis for our updated county status . if a county was classified as established by dennis et al . ( 1998 ) , it remained established in the updated classification regardless of whether more recent tick records were available . a county classified as reported by dennis et al . ( 1998 ) retained this status in the updated classification , unless more recent collection records changed the county \u2019 s classification from reported to established . herein , the term county refers to counties and county equivalents corresponding with five-digit federal information processing standard ( fips ) coding .     data sources     six independent literature searches were conducted using scopus and pubmed databases with the following key words \u201c ixodes scapularis , \u201d \u201c ixodes pacificus , \u201d and \u201ctick \u201d to identify relevant articles and abstracts published from 1996 through 25 august 2015. we also conducted a search to ensure that papers using the junior synonym \u201c ixodes dammini \u201d rather than ixodes scapularis were included . all reports that explicitly presented county-specific tick data were included in our database . in addition , we visited individual state health department web sites to identify county-level tick surveillance data , and contacted public health officials , acarologists , and lyme disease investigators throughout the united states to assess county-level tick collection data .     gis mapping     our final database containing state , county , county fips code , county status as per dennis et al . ( 1998 ) , and the updated county status was joined based on fips codes to a continental united states county map using arcmap 10.3 ( esri , redlands , ca ) .     results     counties with recorded presence of i. scapularis or i. pacificus     our updated county status records show that i. scapularis now has been collected from 37 states , from the eastern seaboard to the eastern edge of the great plains , and i. pacificus from six western states ( tables 1 \u2013 3 ; fig . 1 ) . no single state has records of both tick species , and five states in the rocky mountain region lack records for either i. scapularis or i. pacificus : colorado , idaho , montana , new mexico , and wyoming . the presence of i. scapularis has now been documented from 1,420 ( 45.7 % ) of the 3,110 continental united states counties , as compared with 111 ( 3.6 % ) counties for i. pacificus . combined , these primary vectors of b. burgdorferi and other tick-borne disease agents now have been identified in a total of 1,531 ( 49.2 % ) counties spread across 43 states . this marks a 44.7 % increase in the number of counties that have recorded the presence of these ticks since the survey conducted by dennis et al . ( 1998 ) , when 1,058 counties in 41 states reported the ticks to be present . nebraska and north dakota are the two states where i. scapularis was recorded only after the dennis et al .

( 1998 ) , specifically , literature review and inclusion of unpublished data from individual researchers and state public health departments , we showed a substantial increase over the past nearly two decades in counties classified as having i. scapularis present . moreover , the number of counties in which i. scapularis is considered established has more than doubled since the previous national distribution map was published ( dennis et al . 1998 ) . the majority of county status changes occurred in the north , while the distribution in the south remained fairly stable . the north-central focus for i. scapularis in minnesota and wisconsin appears to have expanded in all cardinal directions , and the northeastern focus has spread inland from the atlantic seaboard and expanded in both northerly and southerly directions . as a result , the two previously distinct foci in the north-central and northeastern united states have now converged in the ohio river valley to form a single larger focus . in striking contrast to i. scapularis , increases in counties reporting the presence of i. pacificus in the far west were very modest .     population genetic analyses provide support for the theory that i. scapularis was once established across the northeastern and north-central united states for thousands of years and likely colonized the region following the recession of the pleistocene ice sheet ( humphrey et al . 2010 ) . thus , current trends may represent recolonization of the tick \u2019 s historical range . rapid deforestation and suppression of white-tailed deer during the late 1800s and early 1990s may have restricted i. scapularis to focal refugia ( spielman et al . 1985 , lee et al . 2013 ) . reforestation and increasing abundance of white-tailed deer , the primary hosts of adult i. scapularis ( spielman et al . 1985 ) , are considered to have contributed to the dramatic expansion of the tick \u2019 s range over the past half century ( spielman 1994 ) .     our updated species distribution map shows a continued range expansion for i. scapularis , particularly in northern states . given the lack of systematic surveillance for i. scapularis , one might ask if the range expansion suggested by our data is real or merely an artifact of enhanced tick surveillance and research activities in some areas . a true range expansion of i. scapularis in northern states , as described in this report , is supported by the largely concordant changes in the distribution of human lyme disease cases captured through mandatory reporting of the disease since 1991 ( rand et al . 2007 , raizman et al . 2012 , lee et al . 2013 , serra et al . 2013 , brinkerhoff et al . 2014 , robinson et al . 2014 , wang et al . 2014 , kugeler et al . 2015 , mead 2015 ) . moreover , as detailed later in the text , true range expansions of i. scapularis have been documented in some areas where tick surveillance was conducted routinely during the period of emergence , or where extensive surveys were conducted at discrete time-points spanning periods from when the tick was absent through invasion and establishment .     the north-central states     within the north-central united states , i. scapularis was first described in a focal area of northwestern wisconsin in the late 1960s ( jackson and defoliart 1970 ) . state-wide surveys of adult i. scapularis collected from hunter-killed deer in wisconsin from 1981 \u2013 1989 ( french et al . 1992 ) revealed that the tick had become established in western , southern , and focal parts of the north , but no evidence of the tick was found in other areas in the north or southeastern reaches of wisconsin . subsequent surveys of hunter-killed deer documented continued expansion into the north during the early 1990s ( riehle and paskewitz 1996 ) and eventual invasion of eastern wisconsin by 2008 \u2013 2009 ( lee et al . 2013 ) . ixodes scapularis now appears to be present throughout most of the habitat that is predicted to be suitable for the tick in the state of wisconsin ( guerra et al . 2002 , diuk-wasser et al . 2010 ) .     in neighboring minnesota to the west , i. scapularis was classified as reported or established primarily in counties bordering wisconsin in the east-central portion of minnesota in the mid-1990s ( dennis et al . 1998 ) . opportunistic sampling during 1998 \u2013 1999 revealed the presence of i. scapularis in additional northern and central minnesota counties ( sanders and guilfoile 2000 ) , and new county records from the south-central portion of the state are presented in this report . paralleling this expansion of the tick \u2019 s known range in minnesota , robinson et al . ( 2014 ) noted increases in both the numbers and geographical distributions of i. scapularis -borne diseases in minnesota from 1996 through 2011. the north-westerly expansion appears to have continued into eastern north dakota ( russart et al . 2014 , stone et al . 2015 ) , beyond or near the limit of habitat previously predicted to be suitable for i. scapularis ( estrada-pena 2002 , brownstein et al . 2003 , diuk-wasser et al . 2010 ) .     wisconsin likely served as a primary source for a southerly invasion of i. scapularis into illinois , specifically along the rock river corridor ( cortinas and kitron 2006 ) . surveys of hunter-killed deer from illinois conducted from 1988 \u2013 1996 showed that infested deer were restricted largely to northern counties ( cortinas et al . 2002 ) . however , similar surveys conducted from 1998 to 2003 showed expansion of the tick \u2019 s range to more southern counties and noted that i. scapularis densities decreased along a northern to southern gradient , suggesting that illinois was first colonized in the northwestern and north-central counties , where i. scapularis indeed was first discovered in the state in the late 1980s ( bouseman et al . 1990 , cortinas and kitron 2006 ) . populations of i. scapularis in the extreme northeast along the illinois river speculatively may have originated from established populations in northwestern indiana ( cortinas and kitron 2006 ) . in indiana , where i. scapularis was first collected from deer in northwestern counties in 1987 ( pinger and glancy 1989 ) , densities of i. scapularis are greatest along the western border and decrease eastward ; expansion to eastern counties was observed between 2005 and 2007 ( pinger et al . 1996 , keefe 2008 , raizman et al . 2012 ) .     hamer et al . ( 2010 ) proposed that established i. scapularis populations in indiana seeded colonization of lower michigan , where the tick was first discovered in southwestern lower michigan in 2002 ( foster 2004 ) . invasion of i. scapularis northward along the coast of lake michigan was documented from 2004 \u2013 2008 ; in 2004 , ticks were collected only from the southernmost of the sampled sites , whereas they were found in all sites by 2008. tick densities decreased from south to north , supporting a view that densities would be higher in areas where the tick has been longer established . notably , although inland transects were also surveyed , no evidence of i. scapularis invasion was observed in these transects ( hamer et al . 2010 ) . subsequently , i. scapularis has been reported also from inland counties in southern michigan ( table 2 ) . colonization of the upper peninsula of michigan most likely occurred via northern wisconsin and preceded colonization of the lower peninsula by more than a decade , as i. scapularis was discovered already in the 1980s in menominee county in the upper peninsula of michigan ( strand et al . 1992 , walker et al . 1994 ) .     the northeast     similar to i. scapularis expansion in the north-central focus , the tick \u2019 s range in the northeastern focus appears to have expanded in all directions , except for eastward , where the atlantic ocean prevents further spread . since the survey by dennis et al . ( 1998 ) , i. scapularis appears to have expanded northward in maine , new hampshire , and vermont . in maine , analysis of public submission of ticks from 1989 to 2006 showed a northerly expansion along the atlantic coastline , followed by invasion inland along river corridors ( rand et al . 2007 ) . ixodes scapularis is now considered established in all maine counties . in vermont , drag sampling was conducted from june 2011 to june 2012 along a north-south transect following the connecticut river : densities of i. scapularis generally decreased from south to north , with no ticks collected from the northernmost sites ( serra et al . 2013 ) . expansion of the tick \u2019 s range in these new england states likely contributed , together with increasing tick densities in already established areas , to a 5 \u2013 10-fold increase in incidence of reported lyme disease cases in those states during the past decade ( mead 2015 ) .     since the survey by dennis et al . ( 1998 ) , the number of new york counties where i. scapularis is considered established has nearly doubled from 50.0 to 98.4 % . at the time of the previous report , the tick was established primarily in the southeastern and eastern portions of the state and appears to have expanded in northerly and westerly directions . in parallel with this observation , from 1990 to 2000 , lyme disease surveillance data revealed a northward and westward expansion in the disease focus from a central cluster in the southeastern portion of the state ( i.e. , westchester county ) . moreover , during the same timeframe , the primary epidemiological focus shifted northward along the hudson river ( chen et al . 2005 ) . population genetic analysis of i. scapularis collected from a transect along the hudson river from 2004 to 2009 indicated recent rapid expansion of the tick \u2019 s range , primarily in a northerly direction along the hudson river ( khatchikian et al . 2015 ) ; expansion appears to be the result of local migration of the ticks , via movements of mammal hosts , but some long-distance migration , perhaps via infestation of birds , was detected . importantly , the dna sequence analyses provide evidence for recent range expansion , as opposed to recent detection of in situ populations .     neighboring new york to the south , pennsylvania also experienced a recent westward expansion of i. scapularis . in 2003 , lyme disease cases were reported primarily from eastern counties in pennsylvania . by 2013 , human lyme disease case counts increased markedly in western counties , with cases reported throughout the state ( mead 2015 ) . this mirrors data for range expansion of i. scapularis in pennsylvania . no i. scapularis were collected during a statewide survey from 1963 to 1967 ( snetsinger 1968 ) , whereas the tick was recorded from 49 of 67 counties by the late 1990s ( dennis et al . 1998 ) . a statewide survey conducted during 2012 \u2013 2014 ( hutchinson et al . 2015 ) revealed that the tick now is established in all 67 counties . it is likely that the east-to-west tick expansion across pennsylvania continued into neighboring ohio to the west , where active tick surveillance was conducted from 1983 to 2012. surveillance data showed a dramatic increase in i. scapularis abundance beginning in 2009. arguing against increasing tick surveillance as a primary source for the observed range expansion in ohio , the spread of the tick was observed when ohio \u2019 s tick surveillance programs were being considered for termination and their budgets were dwindling ( wang et al . 2014 ) . currently , the i. scapularis range in ohio is largely consistent with the range of deciduous forest in the state . as a result of the westward expansion of the previous northeastern focus and the eastward expansion of the previous north-central focus , the distribution of i. scapularis now appears to be continuous across northern states with convergence of the two previously distinct foci in the ohio river valley .     the west virginia , virginia , and north carolina area     ixodes scapularis has also expanded its range in west virginia , where only 4 counties reported the tick previously ( dennis et al . 1998 ) and now 43 counties are classified as either reported ( n = 20 ) or established ( n = 23 ) . review of lyme disease and i. scapularis surveillance reports ( see references in table 2 ) suggests that the tick is expanding westward across the state , with highly lyme disease endemic counties still focused in the eastern panhandle . similarly , in virginia , i. scapularis was considered established primarily in eastern coastal counties previously ( dennis et al . 1998 ) , but the current survey shows the tick to now be established throughout most of virginia , with the highest densities of openly host-seeking ticks occurring in higher elevation sites ( brinkerhoff et al . 2014 , kelly et al . 2014 ) . the spread of openly host-seeking i. scapularis appears to have proceeded in a southwesterly direction in virginia , concordant with the expanding geographic distribution of lyme disease cases and increasing incidence in virginia ( brinkerhoff et al . 2014 , lantos et al . 2015 ) . comparison of the previous and current distributions of i. scapularis in north carolina also suggests an inland incursion of the tick ( fig . 1 ) . one important caveat to these findings for west virginia , virginia , and north carolina is that the observed spread of i. scapularis may have resulted from southerly spread of i. scapularis from states to the north where this tick is more prone , as compared with southern populations , to seek hosts openly from vegetation ( arsnoe et al . 2015 ) and therefore is more readily contacted by tick dragging or flagging ( diuk-wasser et al . 2006 ) , or by humans and their pets ( stromdahl and hickling 2012 ) . stated differently , this may be an invasion of more easily surveyed northern populations of i. scapularis rather than invasion at the species level in areas where more cryptic southern populations already may have been present but had not been recognized . regardless , the end result is range expansion of i. scapularis populations that commonly contact and bite humans in west virginia , virginia , and north carolina .     the allegheny mountains to mississippi valley area     the authors ( dennis et al . 1998 ) of the previous survey were intrigued with the lack of i. scapularis records , despite collection efforts , from the allegheny mountains to the mississippi valley ( an area spanning western pennsylvania southeastward across kentucky and tennessee ) , because of the tick \u2019 s large geographical coverage in the eastern united states spanning variable climates and forested habitat types . habitat suitability modeling suggested that the area ranged from low ( brownstein et al . 2003 , diuk-wasser et al . 2010 ) to moderately suitable ( estrada-pena 2002 ) . our revised distribution map shows the tick to now be established in this region , attesting to its climate and habitat suitability for i. scapularis . several studies have documented a trend in which the tick expands along riparian corridors ( cortinas et al . 2002 , cortinas and kitron 2006 , rand et al . 2007 , hamer et al . 2010 , serra et al . 2013 , kelly et al . 2014 , khatchikian et al . 2015 ) . this provides a hypothesis for how the area from the allegheny mountains to the mississippi valley could have been or is currently being invaded from areas to the north and east with already established tick populations , first along distinct dispersal corridors followed by more diffuse short-range tick dispersal to suitable habitats across the landscape .     the southeast     in contrast to the observed concordance between the reported distributions of i. scapularis and human lyme disease in the north-central , northeastern , and mid-atlantic states , a wide distribution of this tick vector in the southeast is not similarly associated with widespread lyme disease case occurrence ( mead 2015 ) . lack of concordance in the southeast could arise for several reasons . first , our map displays a coarse , county-scale representation of where the tick is classified as reported or established . the advantage of the county-scale representation is that it matches the spatial scale at which epidemiological surveillance data are presented . however , in some instances , the vector tick may be established only in limited areas of a particular county , putting very few humans at risk for exposure to tick bites ( eisen and eisen 2007 , eisen and eisen 2008 ) . second , while the presence of at least one tick vector species is a prerequisite for sustaining enzootic transmission of b. burgdorferi , density of b. burgdorferi -infected host-seeking nymphs of a species that commonly bite humans is a better surrogate for human risk of exposure to lyme disease spirochetes compared with tick presence data alone . at coarse spatial scales such as states or regions of the united states , density of infected i. scapularis nymphs is significantly and positively associated with lyme disease incidence ( mather et al . 1996 , stafford et al . 1998 , pepin et al . 2012 ) .     a recent systematic field survey of i. scapularis revealed that both the density of host-seeking i. scapularis nymphs and their rate of infection with b. burgdorferi generally were greater in the northern compared with southern states ( diuk-wasser et al . 2012 ) . this is in agreement with field studies indicating that i. scapularis larvae feed primarily on white-footed mice , peromyscus leucopus rafinesque , and other small , highly reservoir-competent mammals in the northeast ( spielman et al . 1985 , giardina et al . 2000 ) , whereas they feed frequently on lizards of , at best , low reservoir-competence for b. burgdorferi in the southeast ( apperson et al . 1993 ) . moreover , the tick \u2019 s host-seeking behavior differs between northern and southern states , such that collection of i. scapularis nymphs by drag sampling ( diuk-wasser et al . 2006 ) or from humans ( stromdahl and hickling 2012 ) is rare in the south but commonplace in the north . variable contact rates between humans and nymphal ticks resulting from regional differences in host-seeking behavior could , in large part , explain regional differences in lyme disease incidence between the northern and southern parts of the eastern united states ( diuk-wasser et al . 2012 , stromdahl and hickling 2012 , kelly et al . 2014 , arsnoe et al . 2015 ) . a recent experimental field study showed differences in host-seeking behavior between i. scapularis of northern versus southern origin , such that ticks of northern origin were more likely to ascend vegetation while questing for a host , regardless of whether field release arenas were located in the north or south , suggesting that host-seeking behavior is strongly determined by genetics and to a lesser extent by environmental conditions ( arsnoe et al . 2015 ) . indeed , population genetic studies show two distinct clades , with the southern clade restricted to the south and the so-called american clade predominant in the north ( norris et al . 1996 , qiu et al . 2002 , humphrey et al . 2010 , van zee et al . 2013 , sakamoto et al . 2014 ) .     the far-western states     the recorded county-level distribution of i. pacificus has changed very little since the previous survey ( dennis et al . 1998 ) . the tick is established primarily in coastal states along the pacific ocean ( washington , oregon , and california ) , but also can occur locally in especially cool or moist settings in more arid inland states ( arizona , nevada , and utah ) . in contrast to i. scapularis , few studies have sought to define the environmental variables that define the distribution of i. pacificus ( eisen et al . 2006b ) . owing in part to sizeable western counties commonly encompassing vast ecological diversity , often with only a portion of a given county presenting risk for human exposure to i. pacificus , there is a lack of concordance between the vector \u2019 s range as defined at the county level and the incidence of lyme disease . for example , in california , although the tick is established in all but three counties , lyme disease incidence is highest in north-coastal counties ( eisen et al . 2006b ) . although b. burgdorferi -infected host-seeking nymphs may be established in limited regions of counties , few humans may be exposed ( eisen et al . 2006b ) . in addition , densities of host-seeking i. pacificus appear to be much lower in southern ( lane et al . 2013 ) compared with northern california ( eisen et al . 2006a ) . likewise , infection rates with b. burgdorferi also appear to be lower in host-seeking nymphs from southern compared with northern california ( eisen et al . 2010 , lane et al . 2013 ) .     future research needs     the data presented and discussed here provide strong support for systematic sampling to assess the density of host-seeking i. scapularis , and the density of nymphs infected with b. burgdorferi and other i. scapularis -borne human pathogens , in strategic areas where the tick can be expected to invade or increase dramatically in numbers in the near future . we also recognize needs for : 1 ) improved regional habitat suitability models to better define the likely extent for continued expansion of i. scapularis ; 2 ) population genetic studies aimed at identifying changes in the geographic range of the american clade of i. scapularis , especially in areas previously dominated by the southern clade such as virginia , and north carolina where american clade invasion likely results in increased human tick bites ; and 3 ) longitudinal studies aimed at identifying how the convergence of the north-central and northeastern tick foci may result in changes in b. burgdorferi genotypes ( pepin et al . 2012 ) , particularly those most likely to cause disease in humans , in the convergence area itself as well as across the north-central and northeast states .     acknowledgments     we thank the following individuals for contributing their unpublished data on collection records for i. scapularis or i. pacificus : i.

and are now found in nearly half of all american counties , including areas where they have never previously been documented , a new analysis has found .         the black-legged tick is now

following its onward march , or hop , across the ohio river valley , western new york and the shores of lake michigan since the 1990s , there has been a tripling in the incidence of lyme disease in

burrow into humans and transmit lyme disease , which causes fever , headache and other flu-like symptoms . further problems include impaired memory , dizziness , heart palpitation and inflammation of the brain and spinal cord . around 300,000 people are diagnosed with lyme disease each year .     the cdc said there has been a 320 % increase in the number of counties in the north-east us considered high risk for lyme disease since the 1990s . overall , more than 45 % of all american counties now host the ticks , up from from 30 % in 1998 , according to the research published in the journal of medical entomology .     reforestation and an increased population of deer , which host the ticks , have contributed to the increase in distribution . temperature and rainfall also influence the fate

symptoms of lyme disease include fever , headache , and fatigue , all of which can be mistaken for the common flu , so medical personnel need to know where these ticks are found in order to make a correct diagnosis . unfortunately , the range of blacklegged ticks had not been re-evaluated in nearly two decades , until now .     dr. rebecca eisen , a research biologist at the u.s. centers for

current geographic distribution .     the team used surveillance methods similar to those used in 1998 so that they would be able to accurately judge the degree to which the distribution of these ticks had changed . using the gathered data , they figured out which counties had established populations , which ones had one or more reports of a blacklegged ticks , and which ones had none .     they found that the blacklegged tick has been reported in more than 45 % of u.s. counties , compared to 30 % of counties in 1998. even more alarming , the blacklegged tick is now considered established in twice the number of counties as in 1998.     most of the geographic expansion of the blacklegged tick appears to be in the northern u.s. , while populations in southern states have remained relatively stable . the range of the western blacklegged tick only increased from 3.4 % to 3.6 % of counties .     \" this study shows that the distribution of lyme disease vectors has

according to new research .     the report from the centers for disease control and prevention , published in the journal of medical entomology , found that the parasites that carry the disease -- known as blacklegged ticks -- are now found in nearly half of all u.s. counties . this was the first study since 1998 to examine where these ticks live .     each year , approximately 30,000 cases of lyme disease are reported to the cdc , though the number is estimated to be much higher , as only a fraction of cases are actually reported . in fact , according to an analysis published last summer , health officials report the number of actual cases is closer to 329,000.     the disease is transmitted to humans through tick bites , and typical symptoms include fever , headache , fatigue , and a rash that often looks like a \" bulls-eye \" at the site of the tick bite . most cases are easily treated with antibiotics , but in some patients , if left untreated , lyme disease can lead to chronic joint inflammation and neurological problems weeks , months , or even years after infection .     for the current study , dr. rebecca eisen , a research biologist at the cdc , and her team looked at data from published reports of state and county tick surveillance data going back to 1996. they analyzed numbers from all 3,110 counties in the u.s. to determine where the ticks were \" established \" -- meaning there were sightings of at least six individual ticks or at least two of the three host-seeking life stages had been identified in a single year . the researchers also noted which counties had one or more reports of blacklegged ticks and which ones had none .     the results showed that the blacklegged tick has been reported in more than 45 percent of u.s. counties , compared to 30 percent of counties in 1998. what ' s more , these ticks are now considered established in twice the number of counties as in 1998.     the most dramatic geographic expansion was seen in the northeast and northern u.s. states , including large areas of new york , vermont , wisconsin , ohio , and minnesota .     entomological society of america     dr. john aucott , director of the johns hopkins lyme disease clinical research center , said that the report correlates to what clinical researchers have observed in human cases .     \" the nice thing about this data is that it shows the vector -- the ticks that transmit lyme disease -- spreading in the same ways that we ' ve been seeing the human cases spreading , \" he told cbs news . \" so , the take home message is that lyme disease is a geographically expanding infectious disease and so the areas of risk have expanded dramatically over the last two decades . \"     aucott explained that reforestation and an increased deer population have contributed to the tick expansion .     \" it ' s really a reconstitution of where the ticks were originally . in the early 1900 ' s , north america was deforested for agriculture and deer were hunted almost to extinction , and so the ticks lost their normal habitat , \" he said . \" now as we allow the united states to reforest and have a booming deer population , the ticks are reclaiming their habitat . \"     climate change may also play a role , he said , as ticks thrive in warm , damp environments .     experts say we will continue to see the number of ticks expand -- along with a rise in cases of lyme disease -- in areas not previously affected .     aucott said it ' s important for people to keep in mind that they can get bitten by a tick anywhere there ' s green space .     \" to get lyme disease , you don ' t have to live out in the country , \" he said . \" there are many green belts and streams that come down into cities and those habitats support deer and ticks really well . the ticks are really everywhere unless you live in an incredible urban center where it ' s all asphalt and concrete . \"     as such , people should take precautions to avoid ticks . the
