fraud has more than doubled in the u.s. over the last 15 years while falling in much of the rest of the world where chip-enabled cards have been in place for much of that time .\n"}, {"url": "file://test/20/1/1", "title": "test/20/1/1", "content": "advertisement     recently received a new credit card that has a microchip on its front ? wondering about the change ?     credit cards with security chips are a part of the new card processing system being adopted by the u.s. , whereby the card used by a consumer will have a special microchip that will need to be inserted in a reader rather than swiped at a checkout terminal to close a transaction .     the new credit cards look like any old credit card except that they have a tiny metallic chip on the front . the chip-embedded cards deploy emv microchips , which is short for europay , mastercard and visa . this system is already in use in several parts of europe .     the microchip basically contains a user ' s payment information , which so far was contained on the magnetic strip . the microchip also gives a novel code which is different for every purchase .     the transition to chip-enabled credit cards will make life more difficult for criminals as they are more secure than magnetic strip-only cards .     how ? because the microprocessor in the microchips - which is like a mini computer - adds an additional layer of security for each transaction .     according to visa ' s stephanie erickson , head of authentication product integration , while criminals were able to make counterfeit physical copies of magnetic strip-based cards , the chip-based cards will make the process more difficult . since the chips contain data relating to a specific purchase , their reproduction is tough .     \" they can ' t create a counterfeit card which is two-thirds of the fraud we see in the system , \" says erickson .     moreover , erickson opines that countries which shifted to this technology within two years of the transition , saw the counterfeit reduce by 60 to 70 percent .     some may argue that the unique transaction code generated by the chip every single time the credit card is used may lead to a compromise . however , experts alleviate the fear by assuring that even if the code was gotten hold of by a thief it would be worthless .     one , however , would still be required to sign even when deploying a chip-based card .     while the new system promises more safety , a downside of the new microchip-based credit cards is that they take longer to process when compared to the older system . if an old swipe transaction took three to five seconds , then this \" dip \" method takes between five to ten seconds .     the increased time for transaction would impact the lines at the checkout and could be a problem especially during high-traffic periods such as black friday .     on oct. 1 , merchants - not card issuers - will be responsible for fraudulent transactions if they don ' t upgrade their payment terminals .     \u00a9 2016 tech times , all rights reserved . do not reproduce without permission .\n"}], "eden": [{"url": "file://test/20/0/1", "title": "test/20/0/1",
