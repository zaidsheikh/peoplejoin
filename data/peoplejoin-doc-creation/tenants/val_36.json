never did so . and he said that if voters want a john f. kennedy-esque clan in the white house , they should look elsewhere .     \u201cif you are looking for camelot , i \u2019 m not your guy , \u201d graham said in an interview . \u201cif you \u2019 re looking for glitz and glamour , i \u2019 m probably the worst choice in the bunch . if you are looking for a determined person to be president , i think i can fill that bill. \u201d     story continued below     since entering the race for the gop nomination last week , the 59-year-old graham has received his share of media coverage over his status as a bachelor , a rarity for a president . his personal life also has been the cause of quips in the back-slapping senate , with the likes of illinois sen. mark kirk caught on mic thursday , referring to graham as a \u201cbro with no ho. \u201d graham himself generated a flood of headlines this week when he suggested he would have a \u201crotating first lady \u201d to fill the spot if he became president .     \u201cwell , i \u2019 ve got a sister . she could play that role if necessary , \u201d graham said in an interview with daily mail online published earlier this week . \u201ci \u2019 ve got a lot of friends . we \u2019 ll have a rotating first lady. \u201d     \u201cit was a joke , \u201d graham told politico .     a single president would be rare but not unprecedented . james buchanan was a lifelong bachelor and the only president who never married , while grover cleveland and woodrow wilson married while in office .     graham \u2019 s single status has much to do with his complicated family life , his friends say . as a college student at the university of south carolina , both of his parents died within 15 months when his sister , darline , was barely a teenager . he returned home from school on the weekends to take care of her , later becoming his sister \u2019 s legal guardian as he entered the air force in 1982 so she could receive medical benefits .     \u201ci \u2019 ve been close once early on , [ as i was ] taking care of my sister , \u201d graham said when asked why he never married . \u201cit \u2019 s something i really don \u2019 t know the answer to , other than i think it \u2019 s ok. at the end of the day , there \u2019 s nothing wrong about not being married . having a marriage and a good family and children is a blessing . but i don \u2019 t think i \u2019 m a defective person by any means. \u201d     he added : \u201ci don \u2019 t think there \u2019 s anything in the constitution that says single people need not apply for president . and if it bothers some people , then they won \u2019 t vote for me . i offer what i offer. \u201d     sen. john mccain ( r-ariz. ) , graham \u2019 s best friend in the senate , offered this assessment : \u201ci know he \u2019 s dated some attractive women from time to time , but i \u2019 ve never seen him get real serious. \u201d     mccain added with a big laugh : \u201ci \u2019 ve often told lindsey that he couldn \u2019 t find anybody that loves him as much as he does. \u201d     sen. lindsey graham ( r-sc ) hugs is sister darline graham nordone on stage as he announces his candidacy for united states president during an outdoor event for supporters on june 1 , 2015 in central , south carolina .     how voters view a bachelor as a candidate is uncertain . over the years , polls have shown that fewer u.s. adults are married , a trend that presidential historian julian zelizer said could mean \u201cmuch less resistance \u201d these days to a non-traditional candidate .     not having a wife by his side could also rob graham of a valuable surrogate on the campaign trail , as his rivals \u2014 like rand paul and hillary clinton \u2014 dispatch their spouses to rally supporters . but graham said his sister , darline graham nordone , who works in vocational rehabilitation in south carolina and has two daughters , would fill that void .     \u201cshe \u2019 s played a big role in my life , \u201d graham said , growing emotional . \u201cyes , she \u2019 ll play a big role in the campaign . she \u2019 s my no . 1 fan . of all the things i \u2019 m proud of , how she turned out i \u2019 m proud of the most. \u201d     even though he \u2019 s single and has no children , graham says he has close family , including an aunt and uncle who took care of him and his sister after his parents died in the mid-1970s .     \u201cyou can be single and still have family , \u201d graham said . \u201ci very much have family \u2014 my aunt and uncle , i try to take care of because they took care of me. \u201d     \u201cthere are millions of people who are single . i don \u2019 t think they need to answer , \u2018why are you single? \u2019 \u201d he added . \u201cwhat they need to be able to prove is , \u2018can you do the job? \u2019 \u2026 again , i don \u2019 t think there \u2019 s anything disqualifying about being single . but that will be up to the american people. \u201d\n"}, {"url": "file://val/36/1/0", "title": "val/36/1/0", "content": "avatar science fiction : united states , 2009 u.s. release date : 2009-12-18 running length : 2 : 41 mpaa classification : pg-13 ( violence , nudity ) theatrical aspect ratio : 1.85 : 1 cast : sam worthington , zoe saldana , sigourney weaver , stephen lang , michelle rodriguez , giovanni ribisi , joel david moore director : james cameron screenplay : james cameron cinematography : mauro fiore music : james horner u.s. distributor : 20th century fox subtitles : none     screened in standard ( non-imax ) digital 3d .     avatar has been described as a \" game-changer , \" and perhaps it is . i ' ll leave that for future historians to determine . what i can say with some assuredness is this is the most technically amazing motion picture to have arrived on screens in many years - perhaps since peter jackson ' s the return of the king . it ' s also among the most anticipated openings of the decade . expectations can be a double-edged sword ; ask george lucas . but when a filmmaker meets or exceeds them , the results are tremendous , and that ' s the case with avatar . james cameron has a lot riding on this film , his long-delayed follow-up to titanic ( which came out an even dozen years ago ) , the all-time box office champion in unadjusted dollars . under \" normal \" circumstances , at stake would have been only cameron ' s reputation and future autonomy with astronomical budgets . but cameron has hitched his wagon to 3d and declared this to be the wave of the future . watching avatar , i can almost believe it . if every filmmaker could do with 3d what cameron achieves , i ' d gladly wear the uncomfortable glasses to every screening .     avatar is entertainment of the highest order . it ' s the best movie of 2009. in 3d , it ' s immersive ( that ' s the buzzword everyone uses for the 3d experience ) , but the traditional film elements - story , character , editing , theme , emotional resonance , etc . - are presented with sufficient expertise to make even the 2d version an engrossing 2 1/2-hour experience . despite expending an extraordinary amount of time , money , and effort perfecting the 3d elements , cameron never lost sight of what ' s important . his narrative could almost be considered a science fiction version of dances with wolves ( by way of surrogates ) , and it works for many of the reasons dances worked . cameron also borrows from his own catalog . the space/military culture is reminiscent of that in aliens and the cross-cultural romance recalls titanic . avatar doesn ' t have leonardo dicaprio but its love story is in some ways more potent than the one told in titanic because the stakes are higher . from a purely visual perspective , cameron gives us one of the most amazing presentations ever of an alien world and builds toward an epic clash that may only have been matched twice previously in movie theaters ( both times by peter jackson ) .     avatar takes us to the planet pandora in the year 2154. pandora is a jungle world at which earthmen have arrived with the intention of performing some strip-mining . although corporations run the show , the military , led by colonel miles quaritch ( stephen lang ) , is on hand to provide protection and lend support . the humans ' engagements with the indigenous humanoid population , the 10-foot high , blue-skinned na ' vi , have been contentious , bordering on hostile . for a while , dr. grace augustine ( sigourney weaver ) had some success interacting with the natives by using \" avatars \" ( synthetic na ' vi remotely controlled by humans ) to provide education and technological advancement , but progress slowed and grace was closed out of na ' vi society . now , she and her group of avatars are trying to find a way back in .     that portal comes in the unlikely person of jake sully ( sam worthington ) , a paraplegic ex-marine . sam ' s journey to pandora is a fluke . his twin brother , who had trained for years to inhabit an avatar and whose genetic identity was imprinted upon one , died unexpectedly and jake was the only one who could take his place . he is caught between two masters : colonel quartich , who wants the soldier to form a bond with the na ' vi so he can pass back valuable tactical information , and grace , who wants to rebuild the lines of communication . a series of events in the jungle separate jake from the other avatars and place him in mortal danger . his life is saved by neytiri ( zoe saldana ) , who distrusts him but believes he is touched by the na ' vi god . she takes him to the \" home tree \" where he must not only plead for his life but for the opportunity to learn their ways . neytiri becomes his mentor and he soon finds himself more in sympathy with his blue-skinned \" brothers \" than with colonel quartich , who is planning a massive operation to relocate the na ' vi away from a rich load of ore.     most 3d films use the technology as a gimmick - a means to prompt younger audience members to \" ooh \" and \" aah . \" that ' s not the case here . cameron ' s film is immersive because the 3d was ingrained in its cinematic dna . he has compensated for the pervasive dimness caused by polarized lenses by increasing the brightness ( the images look too bright when viewed without the glasses ) . he has avoided 3d \" tricks \" ( throwing things at the audience ) that might take the viewer out of the experience . avatar ' s visuals are so sumptuous that , perhaps as little as ten minutes into the movie , i forgot i was wearing the glasses . i ' m still not as bullish as cameron about the future of 3d , but i see potential where i had not previously perceived it .     cameron understands how the pieces of the puzzle need to come together to form a complete motion picture , and he assembles them as only a master can . the story , although simple , resonates deeply at a time when media battles rage about whether or not humanity is destroying itself and its planet . as with dances with wolves and the last samurai , this is about a military man who finds himself transformed by the culture he adopts and ends up opposing his own people in an impossible battle . jake ' s love affair with neytiri confirms cameron as being a romantic at heart . the pandora menagerie is like something out of a dungeon master ' s wet dream : dinosaur-like creatures that are impervious to bullets , vicious carnivores that make t-rexes look tame , scavengers that roam and attack in packs , dragon-like flying creatures that populate the skies , and vegetation that ' s just as alive as the animals . the blue-skinned na ' vi , clearly modeled after the native americans , are among the most \" ordinary \" of pandora ' s inhabitants .     all movies like this must have a villain ; avatar provides two . the first is the bureaucrat , parker selfridge ( giovanni ribisi ) , who is devoted to the profit margin above all else . any resemblance to the paul reiser character in aliens is intentional . maybe cameron was thinking of the studio bosses controlling his budget when he created selfridge . then there ' s colonel quartich , who is brought brilliantly to life by the scene-stealing performance of stephen lang . this man ' s a real sonofabitch , but it ' s impossible not to admire him on one level . like robert duvall in apocalypse now , he loves the smell of napalm in the morning \u2026 at noon , and during the night . quartich is never cgi animated but he always seems bigger than life . if there ' s a human star of avatar , it ' s lang .     lang may have the showiest role but he ' s not the only actor to do a creditable job . sam worthington and sigourney weaver are both solid , even though a good portion of their characters ' screen time is animated . zoe saldana is even more challenged , since she never appears \" in the flesh . \" like andy serkis ' gollum , she is entirely cgi-rendered , but she accomplished her own motion capture work and provided the voice . michelle rodriquez , like stephen lang , is never required to become blue . her role is secondary but unambiguously heroic . weaver ' s presence affirms that , as bad as cameron ' s reputation as a taskmaster may be , there are actors who appreciate his perfectionist approach . ( others in this group include michael biehn , arnold schwarzenegger , bill paxton , and linda hamilton. )     after the late summer 20-minute preview of avatar , there was some unease about the look of the na ' vi . such concerns are baseless . they can appear opposite humans without the special effects being called into question ; we never view them as anything less than three-dimensional . like gollum , they transcend their pixel-based conception . we believe them . we accept them . we care about them . that ' s the key to avatar being more than a hollow spectacle . in transformers 2 , everything ( including the humans ) is soulless . here , there ' s heart and soul to spare .     any criticisms i have of avatar are in the nature of nit-picks , but i will mention them for completeness ' sake . at worst , they are ephemeral distractions , easily dismissed . at best , they will not be noticed at all . sam worthington ' s performance is solid but his american accent is not . as was evident in terminator : salvation , worthington ' s \" american \" sometimes comes with an aussie twang . visually , avatar is almost flawless , but there are some instances when the camera moves so fast that the 3d effect doesn ' t track well , resulting in a brief moment of disorientation . finally , although james horner ' s score is predominantly effective , there are instances in which he again engages in self-cannibalization . material sounding a lot like it originated in his often-used star trek ii and aliens scores pops up from time-to-time .     avatar is the most engaging and enthralling motion picture i have experienced this year - and \" experience \" is the appropriate word . there ' s a rush associated with coming to pandora ; this feels more like an interactive endeavor than a passive one . in addition to being emotionally satisfying and one hell of a wild ride , avatar boasts a smart script , reminding us that would-be blockbusters don ' t have to be defined by the imbecility of a transformers 2 or a 2012. james cameron has been entertaining movie-goers for more than a quarter century and he is in an elite category of filmmakers who has yet to spawn a dog . for quality like this , i ' m willing to wait , although hopefully his next movie will come a little more quickly than the 12 years of avatar ' s gestation .     discuss this topic in the reelviews forums .\n"}], "cassie": [{"url": "file://val/36/1/2", "title": "val/36/1/2", "content": "two alternate titles come to mind when watching avatar , the modest little indie by way of james \" king of the world \" cameron : how about runs with na ' vis , or flies with banshees ?     the filmmaker ' s epic adventure - which cost upward of $ 230 million and , actually , happens to be great fun - is the gamer generation ' s answer to dances with wolves . it ' s a trippy sci-fi tale about an ex-marine , trained to fight an indigenous people , who comes to understand the tribal culture in ways that make him terribly conflicted about annihilating them .     he falls in love , discovers their spiritual connection to nature , and finds himself at odds with his gung-ho superiors .     in dances with wolves ( 1990 ) , it ' s kevin costner ' s u.s. cavalry officer who insinuates himself into the world of the lakota sioux . in avatar , it ' s jake sully ( sam worthington ) , a member of the \" jarhead clan , \" who learns the ways of the na ' vi - a blue-skinned , nba-tall race of humanoids living in paradise on the planet pandora . the na ' vi , who resemble buff , pointy-eared runway models , live in a lush rain forest teeming with exotic beasts , including those aforementioned banshees - flying reptile-like creatures that na ' vi warriors must bond with in a rite of passage .     and it ' s at that point in cameron ' s two-hour , 41-minute marvel - when sully ' s na ' vi avatar and his female friend neytiri ( zoe saldana ) take to the air , astride winged banshees - that cameron ' s long-borning baby really kicks in . it ' s like a runner hitting the zone : all of a sudden , the movie , with its elaborate motion-capture technology ( real actors ' movements and gestures turned into computer-generated images ) , breaks into a new dimension - even if you ' re not watching in 3-d. ( avatar is being released in multiple formats : 3-d , real-d , imax , and lowly , old-fashioned 2-d. )     set in 2154 , avatar begins with sully , who is paralyzed from the waist down ( there have been military conflagrations in nigeria and venezuela , if you ' re keeping track ) , set to replace his dead twin brother in an avatar program on faraway pandora . climb into a pod , hook up the circuitry , and let your mind and body enter a na ' vi alter ego .     it ' s a last-ditch effort led by dr. grace augustine ( a butt-smokin ' sigourney weaver ) and her group of science nerds to befriend \" the indigenous \" with these human/na ' vi hybrids . if they fail , the private military force led by col. miles quaritch ( a cartoonish stephen lang ) , will start killing the na ' vi and defoliating their eden .     why ? because they ' re sitting on mounds of unobtainium ( sounds like something from rocky and bullwinkle ! ) - a mineral vital to earth ' s energy needs . giovanni ribisi is the squirrelly industrialist overseeing the rape and pillage .     avatar isn ' t deep : it has an obvious antiwar , tree-hugging message , and its characters are literally and figuratively archetypes . but worthington , in both his human and na ' vi incarnations , makes the transition from warmonger to peacenik more than believable . one of avatar ' s many brilliant strokes is to have its hero in a wheelchair : when his avatar-self starts running barefoot through the jungles , as agile as a cat , it ' s exhilarating and liberating - for both sully and the audience .     ( early on in dances with wolves , costner ' s lt. dunbar is in danger of having his leg amputated - go figure. )     cameron is not a filmmaker to shy away from spectacle and the gizmos to deliver it . the first two terminators , aliens ( with weaver ) , the abyss , and , of course , titanic , all cost plenty , but with the exception of the abyss , they sold more than enough tickets to make up for the expenditure . whether avatar recoups its outsize production and marketing outlays is a topic for the business wags to mull .     for the folks who plunk down their dollars ( and pick up the plastic 3-d glasses ) , avatar delivers . combining beyond-state-of-the-art moviemaking with a tried-and-true storyline and a gamer-geek sensibility - not to mention a love angle , an otherworldly bestiary , and an arsenal of 22d-century weaponry - the movie quite simply rocks .     contact movie critic steven rea at 215-854-5629 or srea@phillynews.com . read his blog , \" on movies online , \"

colleague and presidential candidate as a \" bro with no ho \" is the latest in a string of controversial remarks that figure to make an already challenging 2016 re-election bid even more difficult .     while most of kirk ' s verbal gaffes have been made in speeches or interviews , his remark thursday about south carolina republican lindsey graham was off-the-cuff and presumably meant to be private . kirk was chatting during a senate committee vote when his words were picked up by a live microphone .     \" he ' s a bro with no ho , \" kirk said , apparently talking to a colleague . \" that ' s what we ' d say on the south side . \"     the audio was quickly circulated by the democratic senatorial campaign committee , and kirk found himself facing a barrage of criticism over a quip that insulted both women and african-americans . kirk ' s comment is even more politically troublesome because all of his potential democratic opponents who have either announced or are considering bids are women , and two of them are african-american .     politico reported that kirk said he regretted the statement when asked about it . his press secretary , danielle varallo , said in an email that \" senator kirk was joking with his colleague and immediately apologized to anyone offended by his remark . \"     \" sen. kirk said he regrets the comments , \" graham said in a statement . \" i believe that is the appropriate response . \"     two announced democratic candidates for kirk ' s senate seat were less forgiving .     u.s. rep. tammy duckworth seized on kirk ' s comment as a fundraising opportunity in an email sent to supporters by rep. jan schakowsky , who said under duckworth ' s letterhead : \" it ' s beyond inappropriate for a u.s. senator to make a joke referring to women as ' hos ' \u2014 and it ' s also reflective of mark kirk ' s broader anti-woman legislative record . \"     andrea zopp , a former prosecutor with the cook county state ' s attorney ' s office , said in a statement that , \" no woman , let alone a woman like me , an african-american and mother of two daughters ... who has spent much of her career overcoming sexist and racist stereotypes would think his remark either appropriate or funny . \"     \" clueless or reckless ? \" zopp asked .     a third potential opponent is democratic rep. robin kelly of matteson , who also is african-american .     kirk , 55 , a north shore republican elected to the senate in 2010 , suffered a massive stroke in 2012 and spent almost a year in rehabilitation .     as he tries for a second six-year term in the senate , kirk has linked himself to republican gov . bruce rauner as a financial and political protector . but that relationship can only go so far . kirk already faced strong head winds in democratic-dominated illinois , including the coattails that could be provided if home state favorite hillary clinton wins her party ' s presidential nomination .     kirk ' s comment also belie his attempts to sell himself to voters as a socially moderate republican .     tim schneider , illinois republican party chairman , described kirk ' s comments as \" unfortunate , \" but said \" you have to consider the context . \"     \" it was meant as an off-the-cuff remark between two colleagues , but \u2026 it was a hot mic , \" schneider said . \" we know the senator is a great , hardworking advocate for the state of illinois , and i think we all say something we regret . he regrets it and has apologized . \"     schneider reaffirmed the state ' s republican party support of kirk ' s re-election bid .     in making the \" bro with no ho \" remark , kirk was playing off recent comments from the south carolina republican about how his white house might look . graham , 59 , recently said publicly that his sister could be his first lady , or that one of his many friends could fill in . \" we ' ll have a rotating first lady , \" graham said .     kirk has been dogged by misstatements , exaggerations and controversial comments through much of his public life . some of the questionable comments came after his 2012 stroke , but not all .     kirk served in the house for nearly 10 years before beating democrat alexi giannoulias in the contest for the senate seat in 2010. leading up to that victory , kirk exaggerated his military record , his private-sector resume and his political accomplishments , claiming credit for the demise of the so-called bridge to nowhere planned for alaska .     during the senate campaign , kirk apologized for inaccurate claims that he had come under enemy fire in iraq , that he ran the pentagon war room and that he was the navy ' s intelligence officer of the year . it was kirk ' s unit that won an award , not him individually .     kirk retired from the navy reserve in may 2013. a 23-year veteran , he served as a naval intelligence officer and attained the rank of commander .     kirk was criticized in 2013 for his call for the mass arrest of what he called the 18,000-strong gangster disciples . he later said he still supported mass arrests of gang members but that he used the 18,000 figure to shock illinoisans into seeing the full extent of the state ' s gang issue .     several months after his gangster disciples roundup idea , kirk described a ride-along with chicago police superintendent garry mccarthy in the auburn gresham neighborhood . kirk said a \" guy got popped \" while they were on patrol . mccarthy later explained that it was a nonfatal , gang-related shooting in which the victim did not cooperate with police .     in another eyebrow-raising remark last december , kirk reacted to a senate committee report on harsh cia interrogations by condemning democratic committee staffers as \" little zombies \" reaching up from their \" political graves . \"     in an interview this year with the peoria journal star , kirk said people drive faster through black neighborhoods .     \" with this state and all of its resources , we could sponsor a whole new class of potential innovators like george washington carver and eventually have a class of african-american billionaires , \" he told the newspaper . \" that would really adjust income differentials and make the diversity and outcome of the state much better so that the black community is not the one we drive faster through . \"     his office later defended his commitment to african-americans and said he was combating gang violence , trying to keep assault weapons off the street and working within the black community to find aspiring entrepreneurs .     kirk also had to clarify his view on climate change after complaining that \" political correctness \" had taken over climate science and misidentifying leif eriksson as the discoverer of greenland . eriksson ' s father , erik thorvaldsson , founded the first european settlement on greenland .\n"}, {"url": "file://val/36/2/1", "title": "val/36/2/1", "content":

has solved ? as early as 1947 , the well-known british researcher arnold tustin ( 1899-1994 ) produced the first model for how a person steers towards a target . he identified a continuous and linear control behaviour . when a car is driven , this corresponds to the driver gently and continuously following the road with the steering wheel . this behaviour is known as tracking within control theory , and it has been the prevailing theory for car driving ever since . however , when comparing the linear model with actual measured data , some deviations become apparent , namely jerkiness in the steering signal .     tustin saw these deviations from the continuous prediction as well , but the mystery has remained unsolved until now . ola benderius and his colleague gustav markkula got the idea while they were attending a lecture on neurocognition at sahlgrenska university hospital . the lecture addressed the behavioural theory of reaching , which concerns the basic human behaviour when we reach for something .     when studying how we humans move our hand from point a to pick up something from point b , the speed of the movement has a direct relationship with the distance - the longer the distance , the quicker the movement . the interesting effect of this is that the time for the movement is the same regardless of the distance .     \" we immediately recognised this pattern from our measured steer signals , \" says ola benderius . \" it was a bit of a eureka moment . was it possible that this basic human behaviour also controlled how we steer a car ? \"     with the idea in mind , ola benderius extracted over 1,000 hours of car and truck driving from real driving data , which resulted in 1.3 million steer corrections . it turned out that 95 per cent of these correspond with the reaching theory . ola benderius and gustav markkula had discovered that steering is not linear when the driver follows the road , but rather that the driver turns the wheel according to the special reaching pattern .     \" we were able to use the theory to explain what researchers had been trying to solve for a long time . this was the answer to the previously inexplicable jerkiness in the control signal . rather than looking upon steering as continuously following the road , steering corrections seem to be applied in a very predetermined manner , \" says ola benderius . \" the control behaviour has also proven to be very natural ; i saw this in an earlier study where i examined driving behaviour in 12 year olds and their parents . \"     with this new knowledge , he was able to develop a mathematical model that can explain many observed steering behaviours , which means that the driver response to different situations can be predicted before it occurs . ola benderius believes the discovery will have an impact on an entire research field .     \" this might completely change how we regard human control of vehicles , crafts and vessels . i hope and believe that many researchers will utilise the findings and start to think in new ways . control behaviour has traditionally been studied on the basis of control theory and technical systems . if it is instead studied on the basis of neuroscience with focus on the human , an entire new world opens up . this could push the research field in an entirely different direction , \" says ola benderius .     ###     facts about the research     the research has been conducted within the adaptive systems research group at the department of applied mechanics at chalmers university of technology . it has been financed by the safer vehicle and traffic safety centre at chalmers and the ffi research programme .     the discovery of the innate steering behaviour was recently published as a scientific paper , \" evidence for a fundamental property of steering \" : http://publications . lib . chalmers . se/ publication/ 205499-evidence-for-a-fundamental-property-of-steering\n"}]},
