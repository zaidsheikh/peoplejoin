the tyner mutiny went viral because the drudge report gave it the blaring-siren treatment . and the site gave it the blaring-siren treatment because conservatives have been ready for a very long time to return to a familiar and comfortable opinion of homeland security : it must be stopped .     advertisement         that opinion was in hibernation , then partial hibernation , for a long time . before 9/11 , the prevailing conservative/libertarian/republican opinion of the national-security state \u2014 of any government effort to protect americans at the point of a gun and the touch of a rubber glove \u2014 was mistrust . the second most common opinion was fear . and the return of those emotions is a lagging reaction to the fact that republicans no longer have to toe the party line on homeland security . they can say what they think , which is that the state can ' t be trusted .     it ' s worth remembering that the idea of a cabinet-level department of homeland security came from the democratic party just after the 9/11 attacks . ( just after 9/11 , president bush created an office of homeland security within the white house. ) it wasn ' t until 2002 that the republican party latched on to the concept and took ownership of it . as they pushed dhs through the house , however , republicans made concessions that demonstrated just how ambivalent they were about the idea of a massive new national-security bureaucracy . plans for national id cards and a system to inform on possible terrorists were killed by republicans like then majority leader and current tea party icon dick armey . certain homeland security proposals , he said , were \" not consistent with a free society . \"     at the time , only 12 republicans voted against the house bill creating dhs . most republican candidates used their support of \" a strong dhs , \" which quickly became a byword for \" being serious about terrorism , \" to clobber democrats who wanted the new federal workers hired to staff the new department to be unionized . this was not something conservatives believed in deeply . it was a useful \u2014 and , if you ask max cleland , successful \u2014 campaign issue .     there were always critics of the strategy . they simply didn ' t have much pull while bush was president . angry criticism of the tsa , dhs , and the surveillance state came out of a rump of congressional republicans , from think tanks and from talk radio hosts like alex jones and pundits like andrew napolitano . but none of this challenged republicans ' strategic thinking . the first victories of the conservative civil liberties crowd came in 2007 and 2008 , when they successfully beat back a plan for a national id card \u2014 technically , nationally compatible state ids \u2014 that had been scrapped from the first dhs bill .     tea party activists like to date the backlash to big government to the 2008 passage of tarp . but the backlash against the tsa started a little earlier . according to tom blank , the deputy administrator of tsa in the post-9/11 years , the agency was always cognizant of how unpopular scanning could be .     \" i used to sit around and look at these images , dial them back , and ask myself how do i take this to capitol hill and not be thrown out on my head ? \" said blank . \" when [ bush ' s second tsa administrator ] kip hawley came in [ in 2005 ] , he changed that . he saw the politics of it and deep-sixed the program . he deep-sixed it . it got revived after the christmas bomber . \"     the point about how full-body scanning got restarted is essential \u2014 it was the obama administration picking up an idea that republicans had cooled on . republicans accused the administration of degrading security by dialing back war-on-terror prosecutions in the name of human rights ; the response was a security measure that would affect all travelers randomly . so maybe the drudge report didn ' t really invent a backlash against napolitano . the backlash was inevitable . republican trust in a sprawling and invasive security apparatus was always precarious . its collapse leaves the tsa and the obama administration with yet another libertarian , anti-state riot on their hands .     they have the media , too , for what that ' s worth . alex altman ' s take on the \" hysteria \" in time dismissed the backlash as \" tailor-made for the internet ' s ephemeral obsessions \" and at odds with a pew poll showing 81 percent of people accepting full-body scans . \" sometimes the screams of an aggrieved minority drowns out the rest of the public , \" said altman , \" and this may be one of those cases . \"     which may be true . or not . in 2009 , the smart take on the rage against health-care reform was that it was ephemeral , tailor-made for the aggrieved minority , a bunch of anti-government yokels screaming about a policy they didn ' t understand . yet that rage clearly lasted long enough to hurt the democrats at the polls this month . and health care reform at least had a cheering section in the liberal press . that press isn ' t cheering on the tsa . democrats aren ' t particularly fond of the way the tsa operates . pilots aren ' t happy . in an age of right-wing backlashes to the state , the only surprise is that this took so long .     like slate on facebook .  .     like slate politics on facebook . follow slate on twitter .\n"}], "bhushan": [], "farshid":

better for losing weight and may also be better for lowering the risk of heart disease than a low-fat diet , according to a new study .     while low-carb diets have outperformed other diets when it comes to weight loss , some researchers feared they might be worse for heart health because they tend to be high in fat .     the new study shows that with proper nutritional counseling , people can lose more weight and lower their risk factors for heart disease on a low-carbohydrate diet , said the lead author , dr. lydia bazzano of tulane university in new orleans .     \" this study shows if you are overweight and have cardiovascular disease risk factors and haven ' t had success on other diets , certainly a low-carbohydrate diet is worth a try , \" said bazzano .     carbohydrates are found in food and include sugar , fiber and starches that give the body energy . some carbs - like those in whole grains and fruits - are healthier than others - like those in white bread and other processed foods .     bazzano and her colleagues write in annals of internal medicine that low-carb diets have become popular weight loss strategies in recent years . studies on their effects on cardiovascular risk factors have produced mixed results , however .     for the new study , she and her colleagues recruited 148 obese men and women between the ages of 22 and 75. none of the participants had heart disease or diabetes .     half were randomly assigned to follow a low-carbohydrate diet for a year , and the other half were assigned to a low-fat diet for a year . they were told to not change their physical activity throughout the trial .     all participants attended regular meetings where they learned about portion control , healthy eating and overall nutrition . they were also offered one meal-replacement bar or shake per day .     the only difference between the groups was the proportions of carbohydrate and fat in their diets .     those in the low-carbohydrate group were told to eat at no more than 40 grams of digestible carbohydrates per day . ( \" digestible carbs \" equals total carbs minus total fiber. )     those in the low-fat group were told not to get more than 30 percent of their daily energy from fat and no more than 55 percent of their daily energy from carbohydrates .     overall , about four of every five participants were still following the diets 12 months later .     during that time , the researchers found , people on the low-carbohydrate diet lost more weight and more body fat than those on the low-fat diet .     the difference in lost weight between the two groups would represent about eight additional pounds .     additionally , the researchers saw no increases in total cholesterol or \" bad \" ldl cholesterol between the two groups . bazzano said that ' s good news since some thought a low-carbohydrate diet would increase cholesterol levels .     those in the low-carbohydrate group had lower levels of fat circulating in their blood and had lower scores on a measure often used to predict the risk of a heart attack or stroke within the next 10 years .     \" i thought that was a very striking finding , \" bazzano said . she added that the score that predicts risk of future heart attacks and strokes was computed after the study was finished and is less reliable than the other risk factors they measured .     dr. david jenkins , who wasn ' t involved in the study , told reuters health , \" this doesn \u2019 t look to me to say ' eat all the meats you want to lower your carbohydrates . ' that \u2019 s just one way to do it . \"     instead , jenkins said , people in this study appeared to improve their overall diets . for example , they were eating foods with healthier fats , such as nuts and beans .     he also said they seemed to eat more fiber and cut down on processed foods with more carbohydrates .     \" i think it \u2019 s another testament to what one can do with a more plant-based diet using the right macronutrient profile , \" said jenkins of the department of nutritional sciences at the university of toronto and the keenan research centre at st. michael ' s hospital .     bazzano agreed that the overall diets improved among the participants and they were encouraged to eat healthier forms of protein like chicken , fish , nuts and beans .     she also said her team is not sure why people on the low-carbohydrate diets lost more weight and had lower risk factors for heart disease after one year . it ' s not clear , she added , if there would still be a difference after a longer period .     source : bit.ly/1qji8og annals of internal medicine , online september 1 , 2014 .\n"}], "dewei": [{"url": "file://val/4/0/2", "title": "val/4/0/2", "content": "bernie sanders bernie sandersmystery surrounds dnc race the hill ' s 12 : 30 report sanders to deliver ' major speech ' on trump more on monday said one of the reasons he decided to run for president as a democrat instead of as an independent was to attract more media coverage .     \u201ci just happen to believe that in this moment of history , given the crises that we face , it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics , \" sanders said at an msnbc town hall .     \u201cwe concluded \u2014 and i think it was absolutely the right decision , that \u2026 in terms of media coverage \u2014 you have to run within the democratic party , \u201d sanders said .     advertisement     the vermont senator pointed to his congressional tenure , saying he ' s worked closely with his democratic colleagues .     \u201ci ' ve been a member of the democratic caucus for 25 years , in the house 16 , in the senate nine years . we ' ve worked very closely , the democrats , \u201d sanders said .     \u201cobviously , i ' ve been one of the strongest opponents of right-wing republicanism . so i felt comfortable doing it , and i think it was the right decision. \u201d     sanders also cited financial reasons for not running as an independent .     \u201cif you ' re a billionaire , you can do that . i ' m not a billionaire . so the structure of american politics today is such that i thought the right ethic was to run within the democratic party , \u201d sanders said .\n"}], "parker": [{"url": "file://val/4/2/1", "title": "val/4/2/1", "content": "cutting back on carbs , not fat , may lead to more weight loss     enlarge this image toggle caption eyecrave llc/istockphoto.com eyecrave llc/istockphoto.com     we ' ve reported a lot this year about how there ' s a major rethinking of fat happening in the u.s.     turns out , eating foods with fat \u2014 everything from avocados and nuts to dairy fat \u2014 doesn ' t make us fat .     but eating too many carbohydrates \u2014 particularly the heavily refined starches found in bagels , white pasta and crackers \u2014 does our collective waistlines no favors .     a new study published in the annals of internal medicine adds to the body of evidence that cutting back on carbs , not fat , can lead to more weight loss .     researchers at tulane university tracked two groups of dieters for one year . the participants ranged in age from their early 20s to their mid-70s and included a mix of african-americans and caucasians .     the low-carb group , which reduced their carb consumption to about 28 percent of their daily calories , lost almost three times as much weight as the low-fat dieters who got about 40 to 45 percent of their calories from carbs .     the low-fat group lost about 4 pounds , whereas the low-carb group ' s average weight loss was almost 12 pounds . participants in the two groups were eating about the same amount of calories .     the study showed that modest reductions in carbohydrate consumption , down to about 28 to 30 percent of diet , could help tip the scales to weight loss . the makeup of the low-carb group ' s diet was : 28 percent carbs 40 to 43 percent fat ( twice as much poly and monounsaturated compared to saturated ) about 28 percent protein the makeup of the low-fat group ' s diet was : 28 percent fat 40 to 45 percent carbs 28 to 32 percent protein     lydia bazzano , one of the study authors and an associate professor of epidemiology at tulane , says she had anticipated some difference in weight loss between the two groups . but the size of the effect \u2014 the nearly 8-pound difference in weight loss \u2014 was surprising , she says .     so , what kinds of meals were the low-carb dieters eating ?     \" typically in the morning they were eating eggs , \" says bazzano . other breakfast items included small portions of high-protein , high-fiber bread , with either butter or other kinds of oily spread .     as for lunch and dinner , the low-carb dieters ate lots of vegetables , salads and protein , including fish , chicken and some red meat . they had generous portions of healthy fats such as olive oils , canola and other plant-based oils .     fat accounted for a sizable part of their diet : from 40 percent to 43 percent of their total daily calories , including about 12 percent from saturated fat .     bazzano says with so many people still abiding by low-fat recommendations , a diet so high in fat might not sound like a good weight-loss strategy . \" it ' s not the general perception , \" she says .     but , in fact , there are a spate of studies that have come to the same conclusion about the benefits of swapping a low-fat , high-carb strategy for a pattern of eating that emphasizes healthy fats and lower carbohydrate consumption .     it ' s not just waistlines that respond . the low-carb , healthy fats approach has been shown to cut the risk of heart disease .     one big study published in the new england journal of medicine found that a mediterranean diet rich in olive oil cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes by 30 percent , compared to a low-fat diet .     research published last year in the journal of the american medical association , which compared a low-glycemic-index diet \u2014 which minimizes refined starches \u2014 with a more traditional low-fat diet , also documented advantages .     \" we saw improvements in triglycerides , [ good ] cholesterol , and the possibility of lower chronic inflammation \" among the lower carb group , jama study author david ludwig of harvard medical school and boston children ' s hospital told us .     here ' s the fascinating part : ludwig also found that when people stopped eating so many refined carbohydrates , they burned off about 150 more calories per day , compared to those eating a higher carb , lower fat diet .     \" too much refined carbohydrates \u2014 white bread , white rice , potato products \u2014 all the foods that crept into our diets as we ' ve followed the low-fat craze has undermined our metabolism , \" says ludwig .     in other words , the high-carb , low-fat pattern of eating \" caused us to become hungrier and burn off fewer calories , \" he says .     what ' s happening in the body when we follow this pattern of eating is still the subject of much research , but ludwig says the thinking goes like this : eating too many carbs can overstimulate the release of insulin and direct more calories into storage in the fat cells .     \" it ' s a double-whammy for weight gain , \" ludwig says . \" we ' ve been told for decades that if you don ' t want fat on your body , don ' t put fat into your body . it ' s a very appealing notion , but the problem is it ' s wrong . \"\n"}]}, "user_id_to_descriptions": {"alice": "Is interested in compiling a summary.", "eden": "Knows about the following topics:\nHillary Clinton, Chris Matthews, Chris Christie, Donald Trump, MSNBC town hall\nsecurity, republicans, democrats, airport security, nuclear weapons", "cassie": "Knows about the following topics:\nJanet Napolitano, TSA, body scanners, Matt Drudge, Big Sis", "bhushan": "Knows about the following topics:\n", "farshid": "Knows about the following topics:\nHillary Clinton, Donald Trump, mob violence, townhall, Chris Matthews\nTulane University, public health, research, funding, acknowledgments\nlow-carbohydrate diet, weight loss, heart disease", "dewei": "Knows about the following topics:\nBernie Sanders, Democratic Party, media coverage, presidential campaign", "parker": "Knows about the following topics:\ncarbohydrates, weight loss, low-fat diet, low-carb diet, fat"}, "user_id_to_table_names": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_templated": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_lowprecision": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_lowprecision_templated": {}}
