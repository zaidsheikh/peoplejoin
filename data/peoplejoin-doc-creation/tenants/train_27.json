released a statement saying that officials were offended by the comments , which were made while herren was \u201cacting independently in her private capacity. \u201d     first amendment protections for those in the public sector make it difficult to terminate or otherwise take action against an employee for offensive statements outside the workplace , according to legal experts .     \u201cgovernment employers can impose restrictions on statements made within the workplace or referring to the workplace , but they can \u2019 t act on statements made outside of the workplace unless they show a substantial likelihood of material impact on the employee \u2019 s performance or disruption within the workplace , \u201d said steven d. zansberg , a first amendment lawyer in denver .     the hospital is \u201ca political subdivision of the state , \u201d christensen said .     but a private employer can fire someone for comments made outside the work place , even if there is no obvious impact on their business , without worrying about first amendment protections , said lorri ray , a lawyer with mountain states employers council .     if the public spotlight on the comments has an impact on the hospital , its legal department might find it easier to take adverse employment action , ray said . \u201cbut i \u2019 m sure the lawyers are looking at it very carefully because the right of free speech is protected in the public sector. \u201d     in a letter obtained by the denver post , dr. john reilly jr. , the cu vice chancellor for health affairs , expressed concern to herren over the remarks , saying community members distributed them to cu regents , the school of medicine , affiliated hospitals and local media .     \u201ci ask that you inform me of your perspective on whether you can continue to teach effectively given the multiple communications i have received from students , faculty and public expressing their opinion that your posting demonstrates that you should not be involved in the education of our students , \u201d he wrote .     reilly \u2019 s letter also suggests that herren \u2019 s comments has caused wide-spread damage . \u201cyour comments and tone are harmful to the students we teach and the patients we care for , \u201d he wrote . \u201cyour derogatory , insensitive remarks have resulted in harm to others in our

into the shock-and-awe fundraising business .     an associate of the texas senator , a recently announced presidential candidate , tells bloomberg that a cluster of affiliated super-political action committees was formed only this week , and among them they are expected to have $ 31 million in the bank by friday .     even in the context of a presidential campaign cycle in which the major party nominees are expected to raise more than $ 1.5 billion , cruz \u2019 s haul is eye-popping , one that instantly raises the stakes in the republican fundraising contest .     \u201cour goal is to guarantee senator cruz can compete against any candidate . \u201d dathan voelter     although super-pacs have radically changed the pace at which committees backing presidential candidates can raise money , the cruz haul is remarkable . there are no known cases in which an operation backing a white house hopeful has collected this much money in less than a week .     those involved in the cruz super-pacs say many of his biggest financial backers haven \u2019 t yet made contributions to the new organizations and are expected to do so in the coming months . by law , super-pacs can accept unlimited contributions from individuals .     from his time as a senate candidate in 2012 , cruz has been one of the country \u2019 s most aggressive and successful super-pac fundraisers . his political team has calculated from the start of their planning for a presidential campaign that his overall operation would be able to keep pace with rivals in part because of a robust super-pac operation . they have talked among themselves about the names of numerous wealthy cruz backers who they fully expect will contribute several million dollars each .     still , even some cruz supporters , and many others who have been skeptical that his candidacy could draw significant financial support , are certain to be stunned by this initial round of contributions .     while former florida governor jeb bush is universally expected to easily lead all other republican presidential candidates in financial backing , a hotly debated topic in political circles has been who would finish second to bush in money raised by the end of 2015. this week \u2019 s apparent lightning strike could help cruz claim that spot , possibly besting other leading prospects such as kentucky senator rand paul , former texas governor rick perry , and wisconsin governor scott walker .     cruz \u2019 s campaign is also expected to raise money competitively at the grassroots level through the internet and small-dollar contributions , as well as through traditional bundling of so-called hard-dollar checks , which are subject to limits of $ 2,700 per election per individual . either of those methods , of course , would require significantly more than a week to generate $ 31 million .     according to documents filed with the federal election commission , the treasurer for the three of the new super-pacs is dathan voelter , an austin , texas , attorney who is a longtime friend and financial backer of cruz . a fourth lists as its treasurer jacquelyn james of port jefferson station , n.y. all four pacs have a variant of the name \u201ckeep the promise. \u201d     a document prepared by the super-pac organizers says they \u201care committed to raising the resources necessary to promote senator cruz in his efforts to win the 2016 republican presidential nomination. \u201d the document quotes voelter as saying , \u201cwe \u2019 re just getting started \u2026 our goal is to guarantee senator cruz can compete against any candidate . supporters of the senator now have a powerful vehicle with the resources necessary to aid in his effort to secure the republican nomination and win back the white house. \u201d the document describes those \u201cleading the financial charge \u201d as \u201ca group of close , personal friends of senator cruz , who share his conservative vision for america. \u201d     according to the source close to cruz , more than $ 20 million of the $ 31 million is expected by wednesday , with the rest due in by the end of the week . those cash figures could not be independently confirmed by bloomberg , and sources declined to provide financial documents to support the claim .     the group does not plan to reveal the names or number of donors until they are legally required to do so , at the end of the fec reporting period on july 15.     according to a person familiar with the workings and financing of the new super-pacs , many of the donors are former backers of george w. bush and perry . bush \u2019 s brother , of course , and perry himself , are seeking the white house now , which makes cruz \u2019 s coup that much more impressive . a houston-area associate of cruz \u2019 s has led the effort to pull together the donors , many of whom are texans and new yorkers .     the pac names are \u201ckeep the promise , \u201d \" keep the promise i , \" \u201ckeep the promise ii , \u201d and \u201ckeep the promise iii. \u201d an internal document describing the groups \u2019 intentions says , \u201cevery pac in the keep the promise network will fully comply with all disclosure and recordkeeping obligations set forth in federal law . the use of multiple pacs , however , will allow keep the promise to uniquely and flexibly tailor its activities in support of senator cruz and afford donors greater control over pac operations. \u201d     in a cover letter dated april 6 , sent to the fec along with the formal filings for three of the super-pac entities , voelter says that the trio \u201care affiliated with one another for legal and regulatory purposes. \u201d it lists an austin post office box as their shared address , and the fifth third bank in atlanta as the place where funds are being deposited .     voelter declined to comment .     the document from the group says that \u201ckeep the promise can provide the \u2018appropriate air cover \u2019 in the battle against senator cruz \u2019 s opponents in the washington establishment and on the political left . we plan to support the effort of millions of courageous conservatives who believe 2016 is our last opportunity to \u2018keep the promise \u2019 of america for future generations. \u201d         this story has been updated to reflect the filing of paperwork for a fourth super-pac .\n"}], "hannah": [{"url": "file://train/27/2/0", "title": "train/27/2/0", "content": "close nigel sykes is suing seasons pizza and the newport police department
