often working at assisted living homes for senior citizens , hospitals and libraries , or as store greeters or veterinary aides .     just as important are opportunities for social interaction . as people with williams syndrome mature \u2013 beyond the structure of school and family activities \u2013 they often experience intense isolation which can lead to depression . they are extremely sociable and experience the normal need to connect with others ; however people with williams syndrome often don \u2019 t process nuanced social cues and this makes it difficult to form lasting relationships .     there are many physical features and medical challenges which are fairly common to williams syndrome . however , every child is an individual - the number of features present , and which features are present varies from child to child .     common features of williams syndrome include :     characteristic facial appearance     most young children with williams syndrome are described as having similar facial features . these features include a small upturned nose , long philtrum ( upper lip length ) , wide mouth , full lips , small chin , and puffiness around the eyes . blue and green-eyed children with williams syndrome can have a prominent \" starburst \" or white lacy pattern on their iris . facial features become more apparent with age .     heart and blood vessel problems     the majority of individuals with williams syndrome have some type of heart or blood vessel problem . typically , there is narrowing in the aorta producing supravalvular aortic stenosis ( svas ) , or narrowing in the pulmonary arteries . there is a broad range in the degree of narrowing , ranging from trivial to severe ( requiring surgical correction of the defect ) . since there is an increased risk for development of blood vessel narrowing or high blood pressure over time , periodic monitoring of cardiac status is necessary .     hypercalcemia ( elevated blood calcium levels )     some young children with williams syndrome have elevations in their blood calcium level . the true frequency and cause of this problem is unknown . when hypercalcemia is present , it can cause extreme irritability or \" colic-like \" symptoms . occasionally , dietary or medical treatment is needed . in most cases , the problem resolves on its own during childhood , but lifelong abnormality in calcium or vitamin d metabolism may exist and should be monitored .     low birth-weight / slow weight gain     most children with williams syndrome have a slightly lower birth-weight than their brothers or sisters . slow weight gain , especially during the first several years of life , is also a common problem and many children are diagnosed as \" failure to thrive \" . adult stature is smaller than average     feeding difficulty ( generally limited to the early years )     many infants and young children have feeding problems . these problems have been linked to low muscle tone , severe gag reflex , poor suck/swallow , tactile defensiveness etc . feeding difficulties tend to resolve as the children get older .     irritability ( colic during infancy )     many infants with williams syndrome have an extended period of colic or irritability . this typically lasts from 4 to 10 months of age , then resolves . abnormal sleep patterns with delayed acquisition of sleeping through the night may be associated with the colic . extreme irritability may also be caused by hypercalcemia in some children with ws .     dental abnormalities     slightly small , widely spaced teeth are common in children with williams syndrome . they also may have a variety of abnormalities of occlusion ( bite ) , tooth shape or appearance . most of these dental changes are readily amenable to orthodontic correction .     kidney abnormalities     there is a slightly increased frequency of problems with kidney structure and/or function .     hernias     inguinal ( groin ) and umbilical hernias are more common in williams syndrome than in the general population .     hyperacusis ( sensitive hearing )     children with williams syndrome often have more sensitive hearing than other children ; certain frequencies or noise levels can be painful and/or startling to the individual . this condition often improves with age .     musculoskeletal problems     young children with williams syndrome often have low muscle tone and joint laxity . as the children get older , joint stiffness ( contractures ) may develop . physical therapy is very helpful in improving muscle tone , strength and joint range of motion .     overly friendly ( excessively social ) personality     individuals with williams syndrome have a very endearing personality . they have a unique strength in their expressive language skills , and are extremely polite . they are typically unafraid of strangers and show a greater interest in contact with adults than with their peers .     developmental delay , learning challenges and attention deficit disorder     most people with williams syndrome will have mild to severe learning differences and cognitive challenges . young children with williams syndrome often experience developmental delays . milestones such as walking , talking and toilet training are often achieved somewhat later than is considered normal . distractibility is a common problem in mid-childhood , which can improve as the children get older .     older children and adults with williams syndrome often demonstrate intellectual \" strengths and weaknesses . \" there are some intellectual areas ( such as speech , long term memory , and social skills ) in which performance is quite strong , while other intellectual areas ( such as fine motor and spatial relations ) show significant weakness .\n"}, {"url": "file://val/9/1/1", "title": "val/9/1/1", "content": "cancer starts when cells in the body begin to grow out of control . cells in nearly any part of the body can become cancer , and can spread to other areas of the body . to learn more about how cancers start and spread , see what is cancer ?     multiple myeloma is a cancer formed by malignant plasma cells . normal plasma cells are found in the bone marrow and are an important part of the immune system .     the immune system is made up of several types of cells that work together to fight infections and other diseases . lymphocytes ( lymph cells ) are the main cell type of the immune system . the major types of lymphocytes are t cells and b cells .     when b cells respond to an infection , they mature and change into plasma cells . plasma cells make the antibodies ( also called immunoglobulins ) that help the body attack and kill germs . lymphocytes are in many areas of the body , such as lymph nodes , the bone marrow , the intestines , and the bloodstream . plasma cells , however , are mainly found in the bone marrow . bone marrow is the soft tissue inside some hollow bones . in addition to plasma cells , normal bone marrow has cells that make the different normal blood cells .     when plasma cells become cancerous and grow out of control , they can produce a tumor called a plasmacytoma . these tumors generally develop in a bone , but they are also rarely found in other tissues . if someone has only a single plasma cell tumor , the disease is called an isolated ( or solitary ) plasmacytoma . if someone has more than one plasmacytoma , they have multiple myeloma .     multiple myeloma is characterized by several features , including :     low blood counts     in multiple myeloma , the overgrowth of plasma cells in the bone marrow can crowd out normal blood-forming cells , leading to low blood counts . this can cause anemia \u2013 a shortage of red blood cells . people with anemia become pale , weak , and fatigued . multiple myeloma can also cause the level of platelets in the blood to become low ( called thrombocytopenia ) . this can lead to increased bleeding and bruising . another condition that can develop is leukopenia \u2013 a shortage of normal white blood cells . this can lead to problems fighting infections .     bone and calcium problems     myeloma cells also interfere with cells that help keep the bones strong . bones are constantly being remade to keep them strong . two major kinds of bone cells normally work together to keep bones healthy and strong . the cells that lay down new bone are called osteoblasts . the cells that break down old bone are called osteoclasts . myeloma cells make a substance that tells the osteoclasts to speed up dissolving the bone . since the osteoblasts do not get a signal to put down new bone , old bone is broken down without new bone to replace it . this makes the bones weak and they break easily . fractured bones are a major problem in people with myeloma . this increase in bone break-down can also raise calcium levels in the blood . ( problems caused by high calcium levels are discussed in the section \u201chow is multiple myeloma diagnosed ? \u201d )     infections     abnormal plasma cells do not protect the body from infections . as mentioned before , normal plasma cells produce antibodies that attack germs . for example , if you developed pneumonia , normal plasma cells would produce antibodies aimed at the specific bacteria that were causing the illness . these antibodies help the body attack and kill the bacteria . in multiple myeloma , the myeloma cells crowd out the normal plasma cells , so that antibodies to fight the infection can \u2019 t be made . the antibody made by the myeloma cells does not help fight infections . that \u2019 s because the myeloma cells are just many copies of the same plasma cell \u2013 all making copies of the same exact ( or monoclonal ) antibody .     kidney problems     the antibody made by myeloma cells can harm the kidneys . this can lead to kidney damage and even kidney failure .     monoclonal gammopathy     having many copies of the same antibody is known as a monoclonal gammopathy . this condition can be found with a blood test . although people with multiple myeloma have a monoclonal gammopathy , not everyone with monoclonal gammopathy has multiple myeloma . it can also occur in other diseases , such as waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and some lymphomas . it can also occur in a disorder known as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance ( mgus ) , which does not cause problems like multiple myeloma does . however , some people with mgus will eventually go on to develop multiple myeloma or other diseases .     light chain amyloidosis     antibodies are made up of protein chains joined together \u2013 2 short light chains and 2 longer heavy chains . in light chain amyloidosis , abnormal plasma cells make too many light chains . these light chains can deposit in tissues , where they build up . this accumulation of light chains can lead to an abnormal protein in tissues known as amyloid . the buildup of amyloid in certain organs can lead them to enlarge and not work well . for example , when amyloid builds up in the heart , it can cause an irregular heart beat and cause the heart to enlarge and get weaker . a weak heart can lead to a condition called congestive heart failure , with symptoms like shortness of breath and swelling in the legs . amyloid in the kidneys can cause them to work poorly . this may not cause symptoms early on , but the poor kidney function may be found on blood tests . if it gets worse , amyloid in the kidney can lead to kidney failure . see the section \u201csigns and symptoms of multiple myeloma \u201d for more information about the signs and symptoms of light chain amyloidosis .     other names for light chain amyloidosis include al and primary amyloidosis . this is sometimes considered a separate disease from multiple myeloma , but because treatment is often similar to that of myeloma , we will discuss it in this document .     light chain amyloidosis is only one of the diseases where amyloid builds ups and causes problems . amyloidosis can also be caused by a genetic ( hereditary ) disease called familial amyloidosis . long-standing ( chronic ) infection and/or inflammation can also cause amyloidosis . this is known as secondary or aa amyloidosis . this document does not talk about these other kinds of amyloidosis .     monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance     in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance ( mgus ) , abnormal plasma cells produce many copies of the same antibody ( a monoclonal antibody protein ) . however , these plasma cells do not form an actual tumor or mass and do not cause any of the other problems seen in multiple myeloma . mgus usually does not affect a person \u2019 s health . in particular , it doesn \u2019 t cause weak bones , high calcium levels , kidney problems , or low blood counts . it \u2019 s most often found when a routine blood test finds a high level of protein in the blood and further testing shows the protein is a monoclonal antibody . in mgus , the number of plasma cells may be increased , but they still make up less than 10 % of the cells in the bone marrow .     some people with mgus will eventually develop multiple myeloma , lymphoma , or amyloidosis . each year , about 1 % of people with mgus develops one of these diseases . the risk is higher in people whose protein levels are particularly high . patients with mgus don \u2019 t need treatment , but they are watched closely to see if they get a disease that does need to be treated , such as multiple myeloma .     recently , scientists have studied the genes of the plasma cells in patients with mgus . they found that the genetic make-up of these plasma cells resembles myeloma plasma cells more than it resembles that of normal plasma cells . this suggests that these cells are truly malignant , not just slow growing . because people with mgus are generally elderly , they may not live long enough for it to transform into myeloma .     solitary plasmacytomas     this is another type of abnormal plasma cell growth . rather than many tumors in different locations as in multiple myeloma , there is only one tumor , hence the name solitary plasmacytoma .     most often , a solitary plasmacytoma develops in a bone , where it may be called an isolated plasmacytoma of bone . when a plasmacytoma starts in other tissues ( such as the lungs or other organs ) , it is called an extramedullary plasmacytoma . solitary plasmacytomas are most often treated with radiation therapy . sometimes surgery may be used for a single extramedullary plasmacytoma . as long as no other plasmacytomas are found later on , the patient \u2019 s outlook is usually excellent . however , since many people with a solitary plasmacytoma will develop multiple myeloma , these people are watched closely for signs of this disease .\n"}, {"url": "file://val/9/2/0", "title": "val/9/2/0", "content": "a guardian executive admitted hacking telephone messages \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and getting a

community members mourned tuesday for the victims of the shooting at north park elementary school the day before , details began to emerge .     the 9-year-old boy who was wounded monday is awake and expected to survive , san bernardino police chief jarrod burguan said tuesday at a news conference at police headquarters in downtown san bernardino .     \u201call things considered , he \u2019 s in relatively good spirits , \u201d burguan said .     added san bernardino city unified superintendent dale marsden , \u201che \u2019 s up and watching cartoons. \u201d     monday morning , cedric anderson , 53 , of riverside , went to the elementary school where his wife , karen elaine smith , 53 , a 10-year veteran of the school district , was working . saying he was just there to drop something off , he went to her classroom where smith was , along with two classroom aides and 15 special needs students .     anderson took just a few steps into classroom b1 , and , without saying a word , pulled out a smith &amp; wesson .357 magnum revolver and fired 10 shots , reloading midway through , authorities said . smith was killed immediately . two boys , jonathan martinez , 8 , and a 9-year-old fellow student , who has not been identified , were struck near her .     jonathan martinez     jonathan was born with williams syndrome , a genetic condition that affects about 1 in 10,000 people worldwide , including an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 people in the united states . the syndrome causes cardiovascular disease , developmental delays and learning delays , according to the williams syndrome association .     \u201cchildren with williams syndrome tend to be social , friendly and endearing , \u201d marsden said .     a gofundme account is raising money to pay for the funeral and other expenses for jonathan \u2019 s family .     by tuesday evening , it had raised more than $ 65,000 .     \u201cwe honestly can \u2019 t thank everyone enough , \u201d jonathan \u2019 s cousin , brianna lopez , wrote . \u201cwe appreciate everyone \u2019 s sweet words , and we are very speechless . thank you ( for ) coming together . we will keep everyone updated on any further news . my family truly truly appreciates everything from the bottom of our hearts. \u201d     kate cichy , who handles regional communications for gofundme , said a verification team is working with lopez to ensure that the funds go to jonathan \u2019 s parents .     cedric anderson     after shooting smith and the two boys , anderson killed himself .     anderson had been arrested twice in torrance , police records show .     he and smith married on jan. 28 , but had separated . neither of the cases in torrance involved smith .     by mid-march , smith had moved out of their riverside home amidst allegations of infidelity and was living with family , including her adult children . ( all of her children have been checked on and are fine , according to police. )     \u201cit appears that he had been attempting to contact her and get her to move back home , \u201d burguan said .     according to smith family members interviewed by police , anderson had made threats \u2014 although not that he intended to shoot her \u2014 but she didn \u2019 t view them as serious and just thought he was looking for attention . smith apparently did not tell anyone but her closest family members about his odd behavior and the problems she and anderson were experiencing .     \u201cshe effectively kept her private life private , \u201d burguan said .     during their search of the riverside home on monday , investigators found a note from anderson about needing closure and feeling disrespected . but nothing about it suggested it was necessarily a suicide note .     \u201cif found outside of the context of this case , i \u2019 m not sure anyone would be terribly alarmed , \u201d burguan said .     neighbors at the mount wasatch drive house said they saw police detain a man whom burguan identified tuesday as anderson \u2019 s brother . he was interviewed but not arrested , burguan said .     a computer and phone taken from the residence will be examined , authorities said .     unlike the phone of dec. 2 , 2015 , shooter syed rizwan farook , which was hacked only when the fbi hired a company to override the encryption , police do not expect to have difficulty obtaining information from anderson \u2019 s and smith \u2019 s phones , burguan said .     police are now looking at a personal computer and cellphones obtained during their investigation .     surveillance video at north park shows anderson attempted to get in through locked external doors before going through the main office , as school security requires . there , since staff knew him , they sent him to classroom b1 and smith .     \u201cthere was no indication to anyone ( on ) staff that he was a threat , \u201d marsden said . \u201cthe staff knew this newlywed couple but had no information about the crisis they were in. \u201d     anderson was arrested four times between 1982 and 2013 , according to burguan , including for nongun weapons charges , domestic violence and theft , but never convicted . it is not yet known if the domestic violence charge involved smith . an unemployed maintenance worker , anderson was reportedly trying to start his own business .     the smith &amp; wesson revolver anderson used monday was purchased in michigan in 1979 by someone other than him . it \u2019 s not yet clear how anderson got the gun , burguan said .     not uncommon for spouses to visit     marsden said all district policies were complied with when anderson was let onto campus .     \u201cit \u2019 s not uncommon for spouses to visit . there does not appear to be a breakdown of security , \u201d burguan said . \u201cthere will be a full and complete review , but it appears that things worked as they were supposed to , beyond this being a regrettable tragedy. \u201d     north park elementary will be closed until monday . all other district schools will remain open .     the district will do a complete review of its school visitation policies and procedures , according to a news release sent tuesday afternoon .     domestic violence     twitter posts using the hashtag #karensmith began to pop up accompanied by messages about domestic violence .     \u201ca woman is shot and killed by her partner every 16 hours . domestic abusers should not have access to firearms . #karensmith , \u201d read a post from user erin aura .     another man , identifying himself as renee graham , pointed out that if anderson had killed smith in their home instead of a classroom , the attack wouldn \u2019 t be national news . he then urged people to \u201c( s ) top ignoring domestic violence. \u201d     because of the attack , assemblywoman eloise g\u00f3mez reyes and option house inc. will hold a news conference today at option house in san bernardino to discuss domestic violence and the importance of speaking out when it occurs .     \u201cit \u2019 s imperative that we do everything possible to call out domestic violence when it happens and to be there for the victims and connect them with services so they can begin the healing process , \u201d said reyes , a member of the assembly select committee on domestic violence .     the gun-control group everytown for gun safety released a study tuesday showing that between 2009 and 2016 in the u.s. there were 156 mass shootings , resulting in 848 fatalities . the group defines a mass shooting as an event in which at least four people , not including the shooter , are killed by a gun .     of those shootings , 54 percent involved domestic or family violence , according to everytown .     staff writers beatriz valenzuela , brian rokos and larry altman contributed to this report .\n"}, {"url":

he has been mixed up in over his long career , stone has never been at any real risk of serving time behind bars . friday \u2019 s indictment might change his bearing a bit . it \u2019 s one thing to rail publicly against the possibility of a theoretical future indictment , but another to see seven federal criminal charges , carrying a total maximum sentence of 50 years , in black and white . as a practical matter , stone isn \u2019 t looking at anything close to 50 years , but he easily could be facing five years or so if convicted on all counts . for a 66 year-old man like stone , that could mean most or all of the rest of his life , which has to be at least a bit sobering . and the evidence laid out in the indictment seems locked in ; over and over again , the indictment quotes stone \u2019 s lies and then cites hard proof \u2013 typically stone \u2019 s own texts \u2013 to prove that he lied . a good prosecutor could make a compelling case that cooperation offers stone his best and most realistic chance to get through the case without having to serve time .             second , as much as we don \u2019 t like to acknowledge it in our quest for pure justice , money matters . it is expensive to defend yourself in federal court , and it is jaw-droppingly costly to go to trial . stone has flashed vulnerability on this , declaring that he faces legal fees of $ 2 million \u2013 not an outrageous estimate , if a trial is involved \u2013 while noting that he is \u201cnot a wealthy man \u201d and begging for crowdfunded donations .             third , stone is nothing if not ego-driven . we all are , of course , but stone \u2019 s in his own league . a prosecutor might therefore make a pitch to stone along these lines . you can stay quiet , you can be a \u201cstand-up \u201d guy , you can fight the government and maybe even go to trial . trump will send nice tweets about you , you \u2019 ll have a heavy media following for a couple years , but ultimately you \u2019
