even more importantly , the pigeons were able to generalize what they had learned when confronted with novel image sets . the birds \u2019 histological accuracy , like that of humans , was modestly affected by the presence or absence of color as well as by degrees of image compression , but these impacts could be ameliorated with further training . turning to radiology , the birds proved to be similarly capable of detecting cancer-relevant microcalcifications on mammogram images . however , when given a different ( and for humans quite difficult ) task \u2014 namely , classification of suspicious mammographic densities ( masses ) \u2014 the pigeons proved to be capable only of image memorization and were unable to successfully generalize when shown novel examples . the birds \u2019 successes and difficulties suggest that pigeons are well-suited to help us better understand human medical image perception , and may also prove useful in performance assessment and development of medical imaging hardware , image processing , and image analysis tools .     copyright : \u00a9 2015 levenson et al . this is an open access article distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution license , which permits unrestricted use , distribution , and reproduction in any medium , provided the original author and source are credited     introduction     pathologists and radiologists are confronted daily with perceptual challenges in the medical imaging domain . these individuals , even after years of education and training , may sometimes struggle to arrive at correct disease or risk classifications using the visual cues present on microscope slides or medical images ( e.g. , x-rays ) . there is considerable room for enhancing medical image perception and interpretation ; this can occur not only via additional visual and verbal training [ 1 \u2013 3 ] , but also through ever-improving image acquisition technology , image processing and display . however , such innovations in medical imaging must be validated \u2014 using trained observers \u2014 in order to monitor quality and reliability . this process , while necessary , can be difficult , time-consuming and expensive . automated computer-aided substitutes are available , but may fail to faithfully reflect human performance in many cases [ 4 \u2013 6 ] . we describe here a potential alternative approach .     research over the past 50 years has revealed that pigeons can be prodigious discriminators of complex visual stimuli , and are able to detect or discriminate : foreground from background [ 7 ] ; misshapen pharmaceutical capsules [ 8 ] ; letters of the alphabet [ 9 ] ; basic object categories such as cats , flowers , cars , and chairs [ 10 ] ; identities and emotional expressions of human faces [ 11 ] ; and even paintings by monet vs. picasso [ 12 ] , among many other impressive feats . pigeons \u2019 visual memory is also outstanding , as they can recall more than 1,800 images [ 13 ] . importantly , pigeons have demonstrated an ability to generalize their discrimination performance to novel objects or scenes . we are still a long way from knowing precisely how pigeons so successfully differentiate such complex and varied visual stimuli , but color , size , shape , texture , and configural cues all seem to participate [ 14 \u2013 16 ] . importantly , however , the anatomical ( neural ) pathways that are involved , including basal ganglia and pallial-striatal ( cortical-striatal in mammals ) synapses , appear to be functionally equivalent to those in humans [ 11 ] .     given the well-documented visual skills of pigeons , it seemed to us possible that they might also be trained to accurately distinguish medical images of clinical significance . we expected that , entirely without verbal instructions , operant conditioning procedures alone could prove sufficient for teaching the birds the intricate visual discrimination skills associated with diagnosing medically relevant images . the basic similarities between vision-system properties of humans and pigeons also suggested that , if pigeons were confronted with pathology and radiology study sets of increasing difficulty , then their task accuracy would track that achievable by domain-expert human observers .     in these initial studies , we sought answers to four questions . first , could discrimination between benign and malignant pathology and radiology images be taught to pigeons \u2014 entirely without the benefit of verbal instructions generally provided to human observers ? second , could pigeons go beyond mere memorization and demonstrate generalization ( i.e. , perform accurately when confronted with related but novel stimuli ) ? third , how would pigeons perform when given image discrimination tasks that are extremely difficult even for skilled human observers ? and fourth , if the birds were successful , then could such skills have any practical utility ?     we provided food reinforcement to pigeon subjects , maintained just below their free-feeding weight , for correctly discriminating \u2014 via two distinctively colored response buttons \u2014 images of benign or malignant pathology specimens . initial experiments focused on conventionally stained and digitally scanned breast pathology slides , starting with low ( 4\u00d7 ) and extending to medium ( 10\u00d7 ) and high ( 20\u00d7 ) levels of magnification . the pigeons \u2019 successful mastery of these tasks encouraged us to investigate their ability to detect diagnostically important microcalcifications in mammograms ( a challenging , yet tractable task ) [ 17 ] , and also to attempt a much more difficult task , namely to classify benign and malignant breast masses . correctly identifying these challenging target masses is difficult even for trained radiologists [ 18 ] ; and , in fact , it proved to lie at the limits of pigeons \u2019 capabilities .     although pigeons are unlikely to be called upon to offer clinical diagnostic support , it does seem quite possible that their discriminative abilities may be turned to a useful purpose . the need for image quality assessment is a practical one that arises in both pathology and radiology domains . even though pathologists still largely use optical microscopes for their clinical work , with the recent advent of digital pathology , diagnoses are increasingly being rendered directly from a computer screen rather than through a microscope [ 19 \u2013 21 ] . image acquisition and digital display technologies \u2014 and the accompanying software \u2014 are continuously being updated ; each technical iteration must be scrutinized to determine the merits and drawbacks of new vs. existing techniques [ 22 ] . such evaluations often require elaborate study designs and , crucially , the participation of one or more skilled observers [ 23 ] . however , finding available and affordable clinicians can be difficult at best [ 24 ] .     this process is similar to what is done in evaluating medical image quality with model or mathematical ( so-called \u201cideal \u201d ) observers . the purpose of these software-based tools is not to replicate human performance per se , but to help predict , for example , which manipulations of image quality ( e.g. , color fidelity or compression level ) will impact human performance . however , such mathematical models address only narrow sets of questions , are hard to adapt quickly to new problems , and require their own validation vis a vis human performance [ 4 \u2013 6 ] . our research suggests that avian observers might be able to deliver relevant assessments of image diagnostic content and quality , as their performance is reproducible and can easily and quantitatively be tracked by modern conditioning techniques .\n"}, {"url": "file://train/38/2/0", "title": "train/38/2/0", "content": "new york ( ap ) \u2014 gov . andrew cuomo is creating a task force to conduct investigations into nail salons around new york , following a report of widespread exploitation of workers .     the new york times ( http://nyti.ms/1zvy99x ) reported monday that cuomo says he will not stand by as workers are deprived of wages .     a two-part investigative series in the times found nail salon workers were forced to toil long hours amid toxic chemicals performing manicures and pedicures for little wages .     the times stories also reported many workers suffered serious health problems and there was little , if any , protection for them .     cuomo says the plans are taking shape after the reports last week .     he says salons will be required to post signs in a half-dozen languages that inform works of their rights .     ___     information from : the new york times , http://www.nytimes.com\n"}], "parker": [], "dewei": [{"url": "file://train/38/1/0", "title": "train/38/1/0", "content": "starting in 1996 , alexa internet has been donating their crawl data to the internet archive . flowing in every day , these data are added to the wayback machine after an embargo period .\n"}, {"url": "file://train/38/2/1", "title": "train/38/2/1", "content": "since its founding , the panel has reviewed only a small fraction of the substances in use in cosmetics today . among them were dibutyl phthalate and toluene ;

it would also pre-empt states \u2019 abilities to create stronger rules .     the occupational safety and health administration is the federal agency that sets chemical exposure limits in workplaces . the studies that have examined the chemical exposure levels for manicurists have found them to be well below these standards . health advocates say the safety administration \u2019 s standards are badly out of date and flawed .     even dr. michaels , the head of the safety administration , said his agency \u2019 s standards needed revision . currently , he said , workers \u201ccan be exposed to levels that are legal according to osha but are still dangerous. \u201d     advertisement continue reading the main story     the agency makes illustrated pamphlets warning manicurists about the chemical hazards they face and urges them to wear gloves and ventilate their shops . these steps and others become mandatory when exposure limits are exceeded . but in practical terms , with the standards set so high , salons are free to do nothing . dr. michaels said the agency was hamstrung by its own cumbersome rule-making process .     \u201cevery worker has the right to come home safely at the end of every day , \u201d dr. michaels said . \u201cthey shouldn \u2019 t be coming home and getting sick. \u201d     the debate over the chemicals has also unfolded at the state level . in 2005 , lawmakers in california proposed banning dbp from cosmetic products sold or manufactured in the state . industry lobbyists flooded the state capitol ( some bearing gift baskets of lipstick and nail polish ) , spending over a half-million dollars fighting the ban , according to state records . some of the country \u2019 s best-known cosmetics companies \u2014 est\u00e9e lauder , mary kay and opi , among others \u2014 weighed in against it . the bill ultimately failed . a much more limited measure passed \u2014 over the industry \u2019 s objections \u2014 that required cosmetics companies to disclose certain hazardous chemicals to the california department of public health .     blocked by an industry with deep pockets , the california advocates say they had to scale back their goals . they introduced a grass-roots program that officially recognizes \u201chealthy nail salons , \u201d those that carry \u201cgreener \u201d products and that ventilate . the new york city council held a hearing this month on a measure that would establish a similar voluntary program .     today , out of several thousand salons in california , however , there are just 55 salons in the program .     one of them is lulu nail spa , a tiny salon with a dusky rose wall and white-leather pedicure chairs in burlingame , calif. the shop earned the designation in may by switching certain products , using gloves and opening the doors to sweep out fumes . the owner , hai thi le , a vietnamese immigrant , said she hoped the new decal she placed on her window would draw green-minded customers .     but she did not make the changes just for business . as a young woman working in her brother \u2019 s nail shop , ms. le said she breathed in so much acrylic powder that when she kissed her husband after work , he complained her breath smelled of solvent and plastic dust .     standing in the breeze     on her days off from the salon in ridgewood , queens , nancy otavalo ran for a time an ad hoc day care center at her home a few blocks away with her sister , another manicurist . the sisters would pick up salon workers \u2019 children after school for a fee , entertaining them in the basement apartment the sisters shared with their families .     advertisement continue reading the main story     matthew , her colleague \u2019 s son who can barely speak , got special treatment , spending time curled on the gleaming black leather couch \u2014 bought with tips \u2014 that is the centerpiece of her home .     after ms. otavalo miscarried last year , she lay for hours on the same black leather couch , in silence , the lights darkened , unable to summon the willpower to get up .     a week after a procedure to remove the fetus at woodhull medical center in brooklyn , she rose , put on the lavish makeup her sister says makes her feel confident and went back to work at her manicure table .     clients who stopped by for their weekly manicures knew nothing about what happened ; everything appeared the same .     except every so often , after ms. otavalo had painted the last stroke of top coat on a customer \u2019 s hand , she scraped back her chair and walked to the front of the shop . she pulled open the salon \u2019 s glass door to stand in the breeze for a while .\n"}]}, "user_id_to_descriptions": {"alice": "Is interested in compiling a summary.", "farshid": "Knows about the following topics:\npigeons, cancer detection, medical imaging\npigeons, medical imaging, visual skills, image perception, image processing\nnail salon, exploitation, toxic chemicals, Andrew Cuomo, New York", "parker": "Knows about the following topics:\n", "dewei": "Knows about the following topics:\nAlexa Internet, Internet Archive, Wayback Machine\ncosmetics, chemical exposure, manicurists, nail salons, FDA"}, "user_id_to_table_names": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_templated": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_lowprecision": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_lowprecision_templated": {}}
