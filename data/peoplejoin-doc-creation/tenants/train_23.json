means that doctors struggle to find suitable donor organs for critically ill patients who would die without receiving a transplant . sometimes they have to make tough calls such as using a blood group incompatible organ to save a patient \u2019 s life \u2013 even if this comes with additional risk .     about a year ago we made a tough call of our own : we could save a child \u2019 s life by giving the child a liver transplant \u2013 but risked infecting the child with hiv in the process . the donor was the child \u2019 s mother , who is hiv positive and the child was hiv negative . the procedure came with a risk of transmitting hiv to the child .     south africa \u2019 s law does not forbid the transplantation of an organ from a living hiv positive donor to an hiv negative recipient , provided that a robust informed consent process is in place . but this isn \u2019 t universally accepted as best clinical practice because of the risk of hiv transmission to the recipient .     the young recipient had been on the organ donor waiting list for 181 days . the average time on the waiting list in our transplant programme is 49 days . the child \u2019 s mother had repeatedly asked if she could donate a part of her liver , but we could not consider this because it was against the policy in our unit at the time . without a transplant , the child would certainly have died .     after much consideration , and with permission from the medical ethics committee at johannesburg \u2019 s university of the witwatersrand , we decided to go ahead with the transplant . with careful planning we were able to give the child antiretroviral drugs in advance , with the hope of preventing hiv infection .     the transplant , which happened at the university of the witwatersrand \u2019 s donald gordon medical centre , was a success . the child is thriving , but at this point we are unable to determine the child \u2019 s hiv status . in the first month after the transplant we detected hiv antibodies in the child and it looked like hiv infection might have taken place . but as time went by the antibodies declined and are now almost undetectable . we have not been able to work out for certain whether the child has hiv or not . even with ultra-sensitive , specialised testing , we have not been able to detect any hiv in the child \u2019 s blood or cells .     it will probably still be some time before we can be sure . however , the child is doing very well on antiretroviral treatment . and we know from cases where hiv was transmitted inadvertently that people who get hiv from an organ transplant do as well as those who get an hiv-negative organ .     this operation could be a game changer for south africa . the country has a large pool of virally suppressed hiv-positive people who have previously not been considered for living liver donation . viral suppression is when a person with hiv takes their antiretroviral medication as prescribed and their viral load \u2013 the amount of virus in their blood \u2013 is so low that it is undetectable .     ethical and legal considerations     organ transplant comes with many ethical and legal challenges . in this case , some unique and complex issues were carefully considered .     we took great care to consult widely before doing the transplant . this included speaking to the members of the transplant team , bioethicists , lawyers , experts in the field of hiv medicine and wits university \u2019 s medical ethics committee . the committee \u2019 s function is - among other things - to protect patients in medical research , and to make sure doctors are doing procedures for the correct reasons .     it was clear that a transplant was in the child \u2019 s best interests . the bigger ethical question was whether it was right to deny the mother the opportunity to save her child \u2019 s life . a fundamental principle of ethics is to treat people fairly . people with hiv should have the same health care options as everyone else .     we , along with the ethics committee , agreed that as long as the child \u2019 s parents understood that there was a risk the child could acquire hiv , it was acceptable to go ahead with the transplant .     then , to ensure that the child \u2019 s parents were properly informed and in the best position to make a decision , we used an independent donor advocate . the advocate was not employed by the hospital and their main role was to support the parents by ensuring that they understood exactly what the risks were for the mother as a donor . the advocate also engaged with the transplant team on the parents \u2019 behalf , if needed .     in this case , the parents were committed to go ahead with the operation , and had already come to terms with the risk of hiv transmission to their child . they were appreciative that the team were willing to carefully consider this option for them , given that there were no alternatives available and their child was critically ill. we asked both parents to consent to the procedure , as both are responsible for taking care of the child going forward .     lessons and opportunities     this operation has shown that doctors can do this type of transplant , and that outcomes for the hiv positive donor and the recipient can be good . it has also created a unique opportunity for scientists at wits to study hiv transmission under very controlled circumstances .     for now , doctors will not be able to tell parents whether or not their child will get hiv from this type of transplant . this is because this is a single case with many unanswered questions that will hopefully be answered through ongoing research .     going forward , we will continue to ensure that parents are fully aware of the uncertainty in this situation . all future cases will be part of an ongoing research study that will investigate hiv transmission in children in more detail and the ways in which hiv may or may not be spread through organ transplantation .\n"}, {"url": "file://train/23/1/0", "title": "train/23/1/0", "content": "michael dell is close to finishing a risky $ 23 billion deal to take

public .     enlarge image close lucas jackson/reuters michael dell ' s company once had a market cap of more than $ 100 billion .     dell inc. on monday was close to finishing a $ 23 billion deal to take itself private at between $ 13.50 and $ 13.75 a share , said people familiar with the matter . wsj ' s ben worthen reports on digits . photo : dell .     the buyout , if approved by shareholders , would be the largest such deal since the financial crisis .     it also would be an admission by mr. dell that he wasn ' t able to pull off the changes needed to improve his company ' s revenue and profit under wall street ' s glare . the buyout would give mr. dell the largest stake in the company , ensuring that the 47-year-old is the one who gets to oversee any changes .     the round rock , texas , firm once boasted a market capitalization above $ 100 billion as the world ' s largest pc maker . but the company ' s market share has since dwindled to third behind hewlett-packard co. and lenovo group ltd. as tablets and smartphones became more popular .     mr. dell has also had to endure critical comparisons of the financial performance of his company and apple inc. , a matter of particular frustration , according to people familiar with the matter .     timeline : dell ' s ups and downs view graphics     interviews with current and former dell executives , plus other people who know the ceo , paint a picture of a man who appeared increasingly worried about his legacy . these people said it has been years since mr. dell showed the enthusiasm he did when he reclaimed the title of ceo in 2007 after a short period where he served only as chairman of the pc maker .     mr. dell didn ' t respond to a request for comment . a spokesman for the company declined to comment .     dell shares slipped 2.6 % monday to $ 13.27 on the nasdaq stock market .     as part of the deal to go private , mr. dell would contribute his nearly 16 % stake valued at about $ 3.7 billion , plus $ 700 million from an investment firm he controls , the people said . microsoft would invest about $ 2 billion in the form of a subordinated debenture , a less-risky investment than common stock .     microsoft isn ' t expected to get board seats or governance rights in a closely held dell , one of the people said . instead , the companies would tighten their relationship regarding use of microsoft ' s windows software , the person said .     silver lake partners would invest more than $ 1 billion . four banks are expected to arrange about $ 15 billion in debt to help fund the deal , and each would handle about a quarter of that amount , one of the people said .     the move to take the computer maker private is as much about dell the man as dell the company . \" it ' s pretty simple : his name is on the door , \" one former company executive said of mr. dell .     when mr. dell , who started the company in 1984 in his dorm room at the university of texas , returned in january 2007 , he promised to reposition the company for the new age .     mr. dell brought in several new executives , including ones to run operations , marketing and lead dell ' s consumer push . but while sales grew during mr. dell ' s first year back , he couldn ' t sustain the momentum . the operations and marketing chiefs left after less than two years . the consumer chief left in 2010 , after failed attempts at music players , phones and high-end laptops .     mr. dell began taking a step back from public scrutiny . in 2011 , he stopped making prepared remarks on dell ' s earnings calls , leaving that to his finance chief and other lieutenants .     mr. dell still dominated operational reviews , said people who attended the meetings , and he sometimes appeared to focus more on minutiae than big strategic decisions . several years ago , mr. dell wrote a four-page memo after he first played with the xps one , a high-end desktop that embedded all its parts inside the monitor . mr. dell ' s notes , sent late the night he received the machine , included his thoughts on the styrofoam used to package the computer .     by late 2010 , mr. dell had largely abandoned his efforts to develop products for consumers and advocated a new path to become a one-stop shop for businesses . he spent billions acquiring makers of security software , storage systems and other products , with an eye toward reinventing itself as a smaller international business machines corp.     the products for businesses have a higher margin than pcs , but so far haven ' t been able to offset declines in the pc business , which still accounts for half of dell ' s annual $ 62 billion in revenue . overall , pc sales dropped 13 % in the first three quarters of the company ' s fiscal 2013. total revenue was down 7 % over that period .     while mr. dell hasn ' t said what he might do with a closely held dell , analysts said dell now has most of the pieces it needs to become a one-stop technology shop . but it has to make those pieces work together , both technologically and organizationally .     a private dell could focus on that and possibly exit some lower-margin parts of the pc business , such as retail sales to consumers , they said .     mr. dell has tried to position dell as something other than a pc company , pointing out that the machines account for just a third of dell ' s profits .     the people who have worked with him expect some changes to the pc business , but don ' t anticipate mr. dell will stop making pcs altogether .     indeed , mr. dell has appeared wedded to pcs . when hewlett-packard briefly considered spinning out its pc business in 2011 , mr. dell in private conversations derided the idea as a big mistake .     mr. dell has said that some of the pc industry ' s changes caught him unaware .     when asked in a 2011 interview with the wall street journal what surprised him most since he returned as dell ceo in 2007 , mr. dell said the rise of tablets had been unexpected for him .     \" i didn ' t completely see that coming , \" he said , before adding that he didn ' t anticipate business users would give up pcs soon .     \u2014 ian sherr and don clark

at wits donald gordon medical centre to save a child ' s life .     in 2017 , doctors from the transplant unit at the wits donald gordon medical centre performed what is believed to be the world ' s first intentional liver transplant from a mother living with hiv to her critically ill hiv negative child , who had end-stage liver disease .     now , more than a year later , the mother and child have fully recovered , however , doctors are unsure the hiv-status of the child .     in south africa , a country with the largest anti-retroviral therapy ( art ) programme in the world , people with hiv live long and healthy lives .     the success of this world-first operation thus presents a potential new pool of living donors that could save additional lives .     leveraging \" living positive \" to save more lives     in a paper published in prestigious , peer-reviewed journal aids on october 4 , 2018 , scientists in surgery , ethics , and hiv from the university of witwatersrand , johannesburg ( wits ) explain how a chronic shortage of organs compromise their efforts to save lives , and how the decision they made to perform a world-first operation could advance transplantation .     jean botha , principal investigator and transplant surgeon is professor of surgery in the department of surgery in the school of clinical medicine , faculty of health sciences at wits university .     \" two aspects of this case are unique . firstly , it involved intentional donation of an organ from a living hiv positive individual . secondly , pre-exposure prophylaxis [ medication to protect at-risk individuals from contracting the hi virus ] in the child who received the organ may have prevented the transmission of hiv . however , we will only know this conclusively over time , \" says botha , who is also director of transplantation at the transplant unit at the wits donald gordon medical centre .     currently , the wits donald gordon medical centre is the only transplant programme doing living donor liver transplantation in southern africa . it is also the first privately administered teaching hospital in johannesburg and , as a wits hospital , advances specialist training and research .     stringent adherence to ethical guidelines     in this case of transplanting a liver from an hiv positive donor to a non-infected recipient , the transplant team had to unpack the potential risks and benefits to both . the human research ethics committee ( medical ) at wits university approved the liver transplantation from the mother living with hiv to her hiv negative child . their personal details remain confidential .     the child - on the waiting list for a deceased donor for 180 days ( the average is 45 days ) - was frequently admitted for life-threatening complications of end-stage liver disease . without transplant , the child would certainly have died . however , saving the child ' s life needed to be balanced against harm to the donor and the risk of almost certainly transmitting hiv if the mother was the donor .     dr harriet etheredge is a medical bioethicist who holds an honorary position in the department of internal medicine , school of clinical medicine at wits , and oversees ethics and regulatory issues at the wits donald gordon medical centre .     \" extensive efforts were made to identify either a deceased liver donor or an hiv negative living donor for the child before considering an hiv positive parent donor . transplanting hiv positive organs is not illegal in south africa ; however , it is not considered best practice internationally because of the risk of hiv transmission to the recipient . to minimise risk to donors and recipients , this operation is offered only under exceptional circumstances . full consent is required from the parents who must be able to care for a child infected with hiv , \" says etheredge , whose phd is in the field of medical ethics and organ transplantation .     in this transplantation case , the mother asked a number of times for the opportunity to save her child ' s life by donating a segment of her liver . for this mother , quantifying the risk was simpler for the transplant team . dr francesca conradie , hiv clinician , notes , \" when considering an hiv positive parent , it is important that they have an undetectable viral load . this means that they know they are hiv positive and that they have been taking their antiretroviral medication properly for at least six months \" .     this made the risk of donation equivalent to that of an hiv negative living donor . however , living liver donation is never a risk-free procedure , and the team took care to ensure that the mother understood the full ambit of the risk she was undertaking .     \" our independent donor advocate helps the parents understand the risks , makes representations to the transplant team on behalf of the donor if necessary , and provides emotional support throughout the process , \" says etheredge .     intentional transmission of hiv to save a life     the transplant team faced the dilemma of saving the child ' s life whilst at the same time knowing that the child might end up hiv positive because of this decision . however , because this intentional hiv positive living donor liver transplant is likely a world first , the actual chance of transmitting hiv was unknown .     the team decided to work on the basis that the child would contract hiv , and provide management accordingly . but in the time since the transplant , there have been some surprises when it comes to the child ' s hiv status .     \" in the weeks after the transplant , we thought that the child was hiv positive , because we detected hiv antibodies , \" says botha .     the transplant team then accessed specialised testing by hiv experts at the national institute of communicable diseases ( nicd ) who subsequently could not find any active hiv infection in the blood stream of the child , meaning there is a chance that the child is hiv negative .     caroline tiemessen is research professor in the school of pathology at wits and head of cell biology within the centre for hiv and stis .     \" at the moment , we are developing new methods for testing the child , and we hope to be able to have a definitive answer to the question of seroconversion in future . for now the child will remain on art until we have a more comprehensive picture , \" says tiemessen who , in 2017 , led the laboratory investigations in the case where of a south african child living with hiv had remained in remission without art since 2008.     seroconversion is the period of time during which a specific antibody develops and becomes detectable in the blood . after seroconversion has occurred , hiv can be detected in blood tests for the antibody .     expanded organ donor pool to advance transplantation in africa     more than a year since the intentional liver transplantation from a mother living with hiv to her hiv negative child , both donor and recipient have recovered and are well .     dr june fabian , a nephrologist and research director at wits donald gordon medical centre says , \" we have formalised this procedure as a research programme . as we offer this type of transplantation to more children , we hope to be able to draw more definitive conclusions . \"     organ transplantation at the wits donald gordon medical centre is offered to any person irrespective of income or demographic according to \" sickest first \" criterion . this is possible through an existing partnership between the wits donald gordon medical centre and the gauteng department of health .     \" we hope that this ground-breaking operation will be the first of many like it and will contribute towards promoting justice and equity in liver transplantation in south africa , \" says fabian .     ###\n"}, {"url": "file://train/23/2/0",

the east coast , particularly the parts that directly experienced the terrorist attacks of sept. 11 , 2001. although the quake \u2019 s epicenter was less than 100 miles away , the washington
