order involving the ban .     his ruling prevents the executive order from going into effect thursday .     more than half a dozen states are trying to stop the ban , and federal courts in maryland , washington state and hawaii heard arguments wednesday about whether it should be put into practice .     hawaii argued that the ban discriminates on the basis of nationality and would prevent hawaii residents from receiving visits from relatives in the six mostly muslim countries covered by the ban .     the state also says the ban would harm its tourism industry and the ability to recruit foreign students and workers .     ___     3 : 30 p.m.     a federal judge in seattle said after a hearing that he will issue a written order about whether to block president donald trump ' s revised travel ban but didn ' t say when he would make his decision .     judge james robart told lawyers for an immigrant rights group and for the justice department that he ' s most interested in whether the ban violates federal immigration law , and whether affected immigrants would be irreparably harmed should the ban go into effect .     the judge spent much of the wednesday hearing grilling the lawyers about two seemingly conflicting federal laws on immigration \u2014 one which gives the president the authority to keep any class of aliens out of the country , and another that forbids the government from discriminating on the basis of nationality when it comes to issuing immigrant visas .     ___     2 : 55 p.m.     hawaii attorney general doug chin says he ' s cautiously optimistic that a federal judge will rule in the state ' s favor and issue an injunction against president donald trump ' s revised travel ban before it goes into effect .     chin spoke at a news conference

. oregon filed a brief supporting hawaii ' s lawsuit .     rosenblum says it ' s helpful that challenges to the travel ban are being held in so many jurisdictions , with the hope that at least one judge will issue a temporary restraining order .     other hearings were held wednesday in federal courts in maryland and washington state challenging the ban .     ___     2 : 15 p.m.     a hearing on president donald trump ' s revised travel ban is underway in federal court in seattle .     judge james robart began the session wednesday by questioning a lawyer for the northwest immigrant rights project about two seemingly conflicting federal laws on immigration .     one gives the president the authority to keep any class of aliens out of the country , and another forbids the government from discriminating on the basis of nationality when it comes to issuing visas .     attorney matt adams responded that while the law does give the president broad authority , congress later clarified the law to say the government can ' t discriminate on the basis of nationality any more than it could bar people based on their race .     ___     2 p.m.     a federal judge in hawaii is considering a request to issue a temporary restraining order against the revised travel ban ordered by president donald trump .     u.s. district judge derrick watson says he will issue a written order by 9 : 01 p.m. pdt , when trump ' s executive order is set to take effect .     watson made the statement wednesday after hearing arguments by both sides in the case .     the ban blocks new visas for people from six predominantly muslim countries and temporarily halts the u.s. refugee program .     hawaii was the first state to file a lawsuit challenging the revised ban .     its motion for a restraining order contends the ban discriminates on the basis of national origin .     the state also argues that the ban would prevent hawaii residents from receiving visits from relatives in the six mostly muslim countries covered by the ban .     the government says hawaii ' s concerns are speculation .     more than half a dozen states are trying to stop the ban .     ___     4 : 45 p.m.     a justice department attorney is arguing that there ' s no need for a judge in hawaii to issue an emergency restraining order against the revised travel ban issued by president donald trump .     jeffrey wall of the office of the solicitor general said during a hearing wednesday that plaintiffs have said little about harm from the ban that was not speculative .     he said hawaii is making generalized allegations .     wall said if the judge is inclined to issue an injunction , it shouldn ' t be nationwide and should be tailored to the claims raised by hawaii .     ___     1 : 25 p.m.

federal immigration law .     u.s. district judge james robart is hearing arguments in that case later in the day .     ferguson said robart should consider washington state ' s new emergency motion for a temporary restraining order if he doesn ' t see fit to issue an order in the case by the rights group or to rule immediately on a prior motion by washington state .     the justice department says trump ' s action is a lawful exercise of presidential authority .     ___     1 : 15 p.m.     the state of hawaii says an imam from honolulu has legal standing to assert the first amendment claim of religious discrimination when challenging president donald trump ' s revised travel ban .     hawaii ' s case for a temporary restraining order to block the ban is being heard wednesday in federal court in honolulu .     the judge told lawyers that he is more interested in constitutional claims and wanted to know who had such standing in the lawsuit .     attorney colleen roh sinzdak says a muslim plaintiff in the lawsuit , ismail elshikh , has such standing to challenge the ban . elshikh says the ban prevents his mother-in-law , who lives in syria , from visiting family in hawaii .

takes effect at 12 : 01 a.m. thursday . he also said wednesday he may issue a narrow ruling that does not address the ban nationwide .     the lawsuit in maryland was filed by the aclu and other groups representing immigrants and refugees , as well as some individual plaintiffs . they argue banning travel from six majority-muslim countries is unconstitutional discrimination on the basis of religion . they also say it ' s illegal for trump to reduce the number of refugees allowed into the united states this year by more than half .     government lawyers argued the ban was revised significantly to address legal concerns and no longer singles out muslims .     ___     11 : 20 a.m. edt     the seattle federal judge who blocked president donald trump ' s original travel ban will hear a challenge to the new order by an immigrant rights group .     u.s. district judge james robart will hear arguments wednesday in the lawsuit brought by the northwest immigrant rights project . the group says the new version of the travel ban discriminates against muslims and raises the same legal issues as the original .     robart also is overseeing the legal challenge brought by washington state . he also issued the order halting nationwide implementation of the first ban . among the plaintiffs in the northwest immigrant rights project case is a legal permanent resident who has been trying to bring her 16-year-old son from war-torn syria .     the trump administration says it believes its revised order is legal . the travel ban is scheduled to go into effect next thursday .     ___     10 : 50 a.m. edt     airbnb , lyft and wikimedia are among 58 technology companies backing a lawsuit seeking to block the trump administration ' s revised travel ban from taking

irreparable harm on u.s. businesses and their employees , stifling the growth of the united states ' most prominent industries . \"     the filing supported a legal challenge from the state of hawaii , which is trying to derail trump ' s executive order affecting travelers from six muslim-majority nations .     the tech companies signed onto the new brief also include kickstarter , dropbox inc. , electronic arts , meetup , pintrest , square and tripadvisor . last month , nearly 100 tech companies signed a similar amicus brief opposing trump ' s first proposed travel ban .     ___     9 : 30

he joined 13 other attorneys general in filing an amicus brief monday in the district court for hawaii . hawaii has asked for a temporary restraining order blocking the enforcement of the revised travel ban . a hearing in the case is scheduled for wednesday .     the attorneys general argue that the revised ban retains the unconstitutional components of the original order , including a broad ban on entry by nationals from several predominantly muslim countries and a suspension of the refugee program .     ___     2 : 15 a.m. edt     a maryland judge is scheduled to hold a hearing on a lawsuit stemming from president donald trump ' s travel ban .     several individuals and groups including the american civil liberties union originally filed the lawsuit in february over the initial

use trump \u2019 s own words in ruling against revised travel ban two federal judges halt the president \u2019 s second attempt at his executive order , citing trump \u2019 s prior vows to seek a muslim ban .     a federal judge in hawaii issued a worldwide restraining order against enforcement of key parts of president donald trump \u2019 s revised travel ban executive order just hours before the directive was set to kick in , backed up by a second federal judge in maryland who put out his own ruling blocking parts of the order .     u.s. district court judge derrick watson ruled wednesday that the state of hawaii and a local muslim leader had \u201ca strong likelihood of success on their claim \u201d that trump \u2019 s order intentionally targets muslims and therefore violates the constitution \u2019 s guarantee against establishment of religion .     story continued below     watson bluntly rejected the federal government ' s claims that the new directive does not target islam because it is focused on six countries that account for less than 9 percent of the world ' s muslims .     \" the illogic of the government \u2019 s contentions is palpable , \" wrote watson , an appointee of president barack obama . \" the notion that one can demonstrate animus toward any group of people only by targeting all of them at once is fundamentally flawed . the court declines to relegate its establishment clause analysis to a purely mathematical exercise . \"     hours after that opinion emerged , a federal judge in maryland , u.s. district court judge theodore chuang \u2014 also an obama appointee and a former department of homeland security deputy counsel \u2014 held that trump ' s order appeared to violate a specific provision in federal law by blocking the issuance of immigrant visas from the six targeted countries .     the rulings are another serious blow to trump \u2019 s attempt to limit immigration as part of what he claims is an effort to reduce the threat of terrorist attacks in the u.s.     trump slammed the decision during a speech to a campaign rally in nashville on wednesday a short time after the new restraining order was issued .     \" this is , in the opinion of many , an unprecedented judicial overreach . ... this ruling makes us look weak , \" the president declared before appearing to vow to take the issue to the supreme court . \" this is a watered-down version of the first one . ... i think we should go back to the first one and go all the way which is what i wanted to do in the first place . \"     \u201ctrump \u2019 s statements tonight ? he should just continue talking , because he \u2019 s making our arguments for us , \u201d said marielena hincapi\u00e9 , executive director of the national immigration law center .     a spokewoman for the department of justice called the ruling \" flawed both in reasoning and in scope , \" adding that the administration will \" continue to defend this executive order in the courts . \"     trump effectively abandoned the earlier , broader version of his travel ban order after the bulk of it was blocked by another federal judge and a three-judge appeals court panel declined to allow trump to restore it .     as the white house mulled the possibility of an appeal of the latest ruling , there was one piece of good news for trump ' s team : roughly two hours after watson issued the new restraining order , five 9th circuit judges formally declared that the original appeals panel made a \" fundamental error \" by refusing to let trump proceed with his first order .     the dissenters ' move does not alter that earlier ruling but could be seen as a signal to other judges or even the supreme court that trump ' s travel orders are legally valid .     \" the president \u2019 s actions might have been more aggressive than those of his predecessors , but that was his prerogative , \" judge jay bybee and four other republican-appointed appeals judges wrote in a dissent from the decision not to reconsider the appeals court ' s earlier ruling . \" even if we have questions about the basis for the president \u2019 s ultimate findings \u2014 whether it was a ' muslim ban ' or something else \u2014 we do not get to peek behind the curtain . so long as there is one ' facially legitimate and bona fide ' reason for the president \u2019 s actions , our inquiry is at an end . \"     however , chuang soundly rejected that approach in his ruling from maryland early thursday , using trump ' s campaign comments and pledges to conclude that the primary purpose of trump ' s travel ban order was to advance religious bias .     \" these statements , which include explicit , direct statements of president trump ' s animus towards muslims and intention to impose a ban on muslims entering the united states , present a convincing case that the first executive order was issued to accomplish , as nearly as possible , president trump ' s promised muslim ban , \" chuang wrote .     chuang ' s decision flatly dismissed the federal government ' s arguments that trump ' s comments before he took office should not be considered in assessing the executive order ' s purpose .     \" simply because a decisionmaker made the statements during a campaign does not wipe them from the ' reasonable memory ' of a ' reasonable observer , ' \" the judge wrote , pointing to a federal appeals court decision that considered \" billboards and campaign commercials \" for alabama chief justice roy moore in concluding that he was motivated by religion when he had a ten commandments display installed at a state courthouse .     breaking news alerts get breaking news when it happens \u2014 in your inbox . email sign up by signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from politico . you can unsubscribe at any time .     chuang said the conclusion that anti-muslim sentiment was the primarily reason behind the travel ban was supported by the fact that it seemed to be a poor fit for known terrorist threats .     \" in this highly unique case , the record provides strong indications that the national security purpose is not the primary purpose for the travel ban , \" the judge wrote . \" while the travel ban bears no resemblance to any response to a national security risk in recent history , it bears a clear resemblance to the precise action that president trump described as effectuating his muslim ban . \"     watson ' s order took a similar tack , citing campaign trail statements by trump that the judge said amounted to \" significant and unrebutted evidence of religious animus driving the promulgation of the executive order and its related predecessor . \"     watson ' s ruling \u2014 applicable \" in all places , including the united states \" \u2014 blocked two core provisions of trump ' s redrafted order : a 90-day halt in issuance of visas to citizens of six majority-muslim countries and a 120-day halt of refugee admissions from around the globe . the judge ' s 43-page decision was issued about two hours after a court session in honolulu during which he heard arguments over the legality of the revised order , which trump signed last week .     chuang ' s decision was narrower in effect , halting only the ban on newly issued visas for citizens of the six countries and not interfereing with the interruption in refugee admissions .     the rulings followed a series of four court hearings on trump ' s revised travel ban held in the hours before it was set to take effect .     in addition to the court sessions in honolulu and greenbelt , maryland , two hearings took place in     seattle , where u.s. district court judge james robart listened to arguments on a suit filed by individuals in washington state and their family members abroad . in addition , a group of about half a dozen states asked robart , the same judge who issued the injunction last month blocking trump ' s first travel ban , to declare that his initial ruling covers the president ' s replacement order .     citing differences in the two orders , the george w. bush appointee turned down that request , according to reporters in the courtroom . however , robart left unclear whether he would grant separate motions to block the new order .     at the maryland hearing , refugee aid organizations pleaded with chuang not to ignore trump ' s numerous vows to cut off travel to the u.s. by adherents of islam .     \u201cit \u2019 s asking the court to turn a blind eye to all of the evidence that \u2019 s apparent to everybody , \" said omar jadwat of the american civil liberties union . \" it doesn \u2019 t make sense to blind the court. \u201d     however , acting solicitor general jeffrey wall warned the judge against taking into account statements trump made before he took office . the justice department lawyer said the revised order doesn ' t even mention religion .     \" this is an order that draws no religious distinctions at all , \" wall insisted .     the maryland suit was filed last month by two refugee aid groups , the international refugee assistance project and hias , a jewish charity that facilitates refugee resettlement in the u.s. for the federal government . several individuals who claim to be directly affected by trump ' s orders are also plaintiffs .     the maryland suit is the only one that includes a challenge to a specific aspect of trump ' s orders : a provision lowering the cap on annual refugee admissions for the current fiscal year to 50,000 from 110,000. in addition to the broader argument about the order as a whole being tainted by religious bias , the suit argues that trump had no authority to lower that cap since federal law says it must be established before the fiscal year begins .     justice department attorneys also argued that the case should wait to see whether individual immigrants receive waivers that allow them to get visas despite the six-country ban .     washington state attorney general attempts to block trump ' s revised travel ban poster= \"

reasons. \u201d he said the administration would fight the case \u201cas far as it needs to go , \u201d including up to the supreme court , and rued that he had been persuaded to sign a \u201cwatered-down version \u201d of his first travel ban .     \u201clet me tell you something , i think we ought to go back to the first one and go all the way , \u201d trump said . \u201cthe danger is clear , the law is clear , the need for my executive order is clear. \u201d     sarah isgur flores , a spokeswoman for the justice department , said in a statement : \u201cthe department of justice strongly disagrees with the federal district court \u2019 s ruling , which is flawed both in reasoning and in scope . the president \u2019 s executive order falls squarely within his lawful authority in seeking to protect our nation \u2019 s security , and the department will continue to defend this executive order in the courts. \u201d     ( daron taylor/the washington post )     watson was one of three federal judges to hear arguments wednesday about the ban , though he was the first to issue an opinion .     a ruling was also expected from a federal judge in washington .     as the ruling in hawaii was being handed down , james l. \u00adrobart , the federal judge in washington state who froze trump \u2019 s first travel ban , was hearing arguments about whether he should freeze the second . he said he did not think his first freeze was still in effect , though he did not immediately rule on whether he should issue a new one .     watson \u2019 s decision might not be the last word . he was considering only a request for a temporary restraining order , and while that required him to assess whether challengers of the ban would ultimately succeed , his ruling is not final on that question . the justice department could appeal the ruling or wage a longer-term court battle before the judge in hawaii .     watson \u2019 s decision came in response to a lawsuit filed by hawaii . lawyers for the state alleged that the new entry ban , much like the old , violated the establishment clause of the first amendment because it was essentially a muslim ban , hurt the ability of state businesses and universities to recruit top talent , and damaged the state \u2019 s robust tourism industry .     they pointed to the case of \u00adismail elshikh , the imam of the muslim association of hawaii , whose mother-in-law \u2019 s application for an immigrant visa was still being processed . under the new executive order , attorneys for hawaii said , elshikh feared that his mother-in-law , a syrian national , would ultimately be banned from entering the united states .     [ why hawaii says trump \u2019 s new travel ban is still unconstitutional ]     \u201cdr . elshikh certainly has standing in this case . he , along with all of the muslim residents in hawaii , face higher hurdles to see family because of religious faith , \u201d lawyer colleen roh sinzdak said at a hearing wednesday . \u201cit is not merely a harm to the muslim residents of the state of hawaii , but also is a harm to the united states as a whole and is against the first amendment itself. \u201d     elshikh is a u.s. citizen of egyptian descent who has been a resident of hawaii for over a decade . his wife is of syrian descent and is also a resident of hawaii .     justice department lawyers argued that trump was well within his authority to impose the ban , which was necessary for national security , and that those challenging it had raised only speculative harms . \u201cthey bear the burden of showing irreparable harm \u2026 and there is no harm at all , \u201d said the acting u.s. solicitor general , jeffrey wall , who argued on behalf of the government in greenbelt , md. , in the morning and by phone in hawaii in the afternoon .     watson agreed with the state on virtually all the points . he ruled that the state had preliminarily demonstrated its universities and tourism industry would be hurt , and that harm could be traced to the executive order . he wrote that elshikh had alleged \u201cdirect , concrete injuries to both himself and his immediate family. \u201d     and watson declared that the government \u2019 s assertion of the national security need for the order was \u201cat the very least , \u2018secondary to a religious objective \u2019 of temporarily suspending the entry of muslims. \u201d he pointed to trump \u2019 s own campaign trail comments and public statements by advisers as evidence .     \u201cfor instance , there is nothing \u2018veiled \u2019 about this press release : \u2018donald j. trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states , \u2019 \u201d watson wrote . \u201cnor is there anything \u2018secret \u2019 about the executive \u2019 s motive specific to the issuance of the executive order . rudolph giuliani explained on television how the executive order came to be . he said : \u2018when [ mr. trump ] first announced it , he said , \u2018muslim ban. \u2019 he called me up . he said , \u2018put a commission together . show me the right way to do it legally. \u2019 \u201d     watson also pointed to a recent fox news appearance by stephen miller , in which the president \u2019 s senior policy adviser said the new ban would have \u201cmostly minor technical differences \u201d from the previous iteration frozen by the courts , and americans would see \u201cthe same basic policy outcome for the country. \u201d     \u201cthese plainly-worded statements , made in the months leading up to and contemporaneous with the signing of the executive order , and , in many cases , made by the executive himself , betray the executive order \u2019 s stated secular purpose , \u201d watson wrote .     opponents of the ban across the country \u2014 including those who had argued against it in different cases on wednesday \u2014 hailed watson \u2019 s ruling .     bob ferguson , the washington state attorney general who asked robart to block the measure , called the hawaii ruling \u201cfantastic news. \u201d justin cox , a staff attorney for the national immigration law center who argued for a restraining order in the case in maryland , said , \u201cthis is absolutely a victory and should be celebrated as such , especially because the court held that the plaintiffs , that hawaii was likely to succeed on its establishment clause claim which essentially is that the primary purpose of the executive order is to discriminate against muslims. \u201d     cox said while the judge did not halt the order entirely , he blocked the crucial sections \u2014 those halting the issuance of new visas and suspending the refu\u00adgee program . left intact , cox said , were lesser-known provisions , including one that orders homeland security and the u.s. attorney general to publicize information about foreign nationals charged with \u00adterrorism-related offenses and other crimes . he said the provision seems designed to whip up fear of muslims .     \u201cit \u2019 s a shaming device that it \u2019 s really a dehumanizing device , \u201d he said . \u201cit perpetuates this myth , this damaging stereotype of muslims as terrorists. \u201d     trump \u2019 s new entry ban had suspended the u.s. refugee program for 120 days and halted for 90 days the issuance of new visas to people from six muslim-majority countries : iran , somalia , sudan , yemen , libya and syria . it was different from the first entry ban in that it omitted iraq from the list of affected countries , did not affect current visa or green-card holders and spelled out a robust list of people who might be able to apply for exceptions .     the administration could have defended the first ban in court \u2014 though it chose instead to rewrite the president \u2019 s executive order in such a way that it might be more defensible . the next step might have been to persuade the u.s. court of appeals for the 9th circuit to rehear the case en banc , after a three-judge panel with the court upheld the freeze on trump \u2019 s ban .     hawaii is a part of the 9th circuit , so the legal road could pass through the appeals court there again . perhaps previewing the contentious fight ahead , five of the circuit \u2019 s judges on wednesday signed a dissenting opinion in the case over the original travel ban , declaring trump \u2019 s decision to issue the executive order was \u201cwell within the powers of the presidency. \u201d the judges wanted to wipe out a ruling by a three-judge panel declaring otherwise .     \u201cabove all , in a democracy , we have the duty to preserve the liberty of the people by keeping the enormous powers of the national government separated , \u201d judge jay s. bybee wrote for the dissenters . \u201cwe are judges , not platonic guardians . it is our duty to say what the law is , and the meta-source of our law , the u.s. constitution , commits the power to make foreign policy , including the decisions to permit or forbid entry into the united states , to the president and congress. \u201d     the dissent was signed by judges bybee , sandra s. ikuta , consuelo m. callahan and carlos t. bea , who all were appointed by president george w. bush ; and judge alex kozinski , who was appointed by president ronald reagan . it seemed to represent a minority view . the circuit has 25 active judges , and the court said a majority had not voted in favor of reconsidering the three-judge panel \u2019 s published opinion to keep trump \u2019 s first ban frozen .     that opinion was signed by judges michelle t. friedland , who was appointed by president obama ; richard r. clifton , who was appointed by president george w. bush ; and judge william c. canby jr. , who was appointed by president carter .     judge stephen reinhardt , also a carter appointee , formally joined their opinion wednesday and remarked that only a \u201csmall number \u201d of 9th circuit judges wanted to overturn it .     takase reported from honolulu . lornet turnbull in seattle contributed to this report .\n"}]}, "user_id_to_descriptions": {"alice": "Is interested in compiling a summary.", "dewei":
