( r. 111 minutes. )     think of this as a movie review or as just a friendly warning from a like-minded individual : \" identity thief \" looked really good from a distance . in fact , it looked like it couldn ' t miss . melissa mccarthy has emerged in the last two years as one of the funniest and most promising comic actresses around , and the idea of matching her exuberant relentlessness with jason bateman ' s long-suffering sardonicism ( yes , that ' s really a word ) seemed inspired .     indeed , it was inspired . it inspired financial backing , an advertising campaign , two estimable talents and all the moviegoers who are planning to see it this weekend . the only people it most certainly didn ' t inspire were craig mazin and jerry eeten , who wrote the screenplay . \" identity thief \" is not only not funny . it ' s negative funny . it ' s short on laughs , but it will disturb and annoy .     what seemed like a good idea - a comedy based on the phenomenon of identity theft - turned out to be comic quicksand . mccarthy plays diana , a florida woman who has made a life of stealing people ' s identities , getting fake credit cards under the stolen name and running up enormous bills . her latest victim is a nice guy named sandy on the other side of the country , who gets an inkling something is wrong when his credit card is rejected at a gas station . his second clue comes when the cops arrest him for having been drunk and disorderly in florida . he ' s in denver .     if you ' ve followed along this far , you might already be able to diagnose the movie ' s fatal flaw : the concept of one person stealing another ' s identity might be amusing in the abstract , but the minute you start filling in the details , it becomes the stuff of drama , not comedy . this is especially the case in \" identity thief , \" in which sandy ( bateman ) is a sweet guy , a hardworking family man with a third child on the way , who has finally lucked into a high-paying job . but now he faces dismissal , the complete destruction of his life , because of an imbecile in florida .     \" identity thief \" is constructed , believe it or not , as a road movie , a buddy comedy , in which two seeming opposites find common ground . sandy goes down to florida to bring diana back to denver so she can explain the whole situation to his boss . that a borderline sociopath would do a favor for a complete stranger - one who clearly means her ill - is far-fetched even in the loose terms of zany comedy . even if she wanted to leave town , there is no reason she wouldn ' t ditch him at some point along the way .     actually , \" identity thief \" seems to be an attempt to wed a hot topic to the structure of \" midnight run , \" the 1988 classic starring robert de niro and charles grodin . call it a coincidence , but both films feature two antagonists on a cross-country trip . in both , they ' re chased by mobsters ( played here by t.i . and genesis rodriguez ) and by a bounty hunter ( played here by robert patrick ) . in \" midnight run , \" the men become better people for knowing each other , whereas \" identity thief \" is so clumsily written that we ' re told that that happens , even though it doesn ' t . \" you taught me about getting what you want , \" sandy tells his nemesis , \" and about confidence . \"     there are holes in the story you could float a blimp through and loose ends everywhere , but none of that would matter if \" identity thief \" had a spark of joy , some honest life to it . there is none . it ' s just an irritant , and the worst kind to boot , one that resorts to fake sentiment in the end , like a scoundrel begging for a reprieve . yes , two or three times mccarthy , through an unexpected reading of a weak line , can coax a laugh - she ' s that talented - and bateman is true to his role , which is to be a dramatic character facing personal tragedy who just happens to be stuck in a supposed comedy .     but that ' s the best that can be said for \" identity thief , \" and even that ' s not much .\n"}, {"url": "file://test/54/2/1", "title": "test/54/2/1", "content": "a judge on thursday acquitted a man accused of drowning his newlywed wife during a honeymoon diving trip to australia eight years ago , saying in an unusual ruling that prosecutors did not prove the man intentionally killed his wife to collect on a life insurance policy .     tommy thomas identifies a picture of his daughter tina thomas watson for prosecutor don valeska , right , and the jury during the gabe watson capital murder trial at the mel bailey criminal justice center ... ( associated press )     gabe watson , left , stands during a break in his capital murder trial at the mel bailey criminal justice center in birmingham , ala. , thursday , feb. 23 , 2012. an alabama judge acquitted watson , accused ... ( associated press )     circuit judge tommy nail issued his ruling before the defense had even presented its case in the two-week-long trial and before jurors were given the case to deliberate . prosecutor don valeska , head of the violent crimes division for the state attorney general ' s office , said he never before had a trial end in a judge ' s acquittal in 41 years of trying cases .     gabe watson , 34 , had faced life in prison without parole if convicted of murdering his wife , tina thomas watson , in 2003. he already served 18 months in an australian prison after pleading guilty there to a manslaughter charge involving negligence .     nail agreed with defense arguments that prosecutors failed to show watson intentionally killed the woman . prosecutors claimed he drowned her for insurance money , but the only eyewitness testified he thought watson was trying to save the woman .     the state ' s evidence was \" sorely lacking \" and did not prove watson had any financial motive .     \" i don ' t think anyone knows for sure what happened in the water down there , \" nail said . he repeatedly clashed with prosecutors during both the trial and earlier hearings .     defense attorneys had argued that watson didn ' t stand to gain anything monetarily because tina watson ' s father was the beneficiary of her life insurance policy . they contended her death was an accident .     gabe watson ' s father , david , hugged his son in the courtroom after the judge made his ruling . he said every court that had looked at the case determined gabe did not intentionally kill his wife .     \" i ' m just so relieved . hopefully he can put his life back together , \" david watson said .     \" i hope everyone can begin to heal . the rest of his life will determine his legacy . gabe is a good kid . \"     gabe watson left the courtroom hand-in-hand with his second wife without commenting to reporters .     tina watson ' s father , tommy thomas , had testified earlier in the day . he described how his family ' s grief and shock over tina watson ' s death turned to suspicion of gabe watson .     valeska , the prosecutor , walked with his arm around tommy thomas , who appeared to be in shock and stunned by the judge ' s decision .     \" it should have gone to the jury for them to decide , \" thomas said of the judge ' s decision .     thomas had testified earlier that shortly after the death , his wife , cindy , was worried about gabe watson ' s condition . however , evidence showed relations between watson and his wife ' s family frayed quickly as the thomases began having doubts about what happened and gabe watson began asking for tina watson ' s belongings .     gabe watson ' s father called to tell them about the woman ' s death more than 15 hours after she drowned , thomas said , and tina watson ' s family never heard from gabe watson until they attempted to contact him through the u.s. consulate in australia .     thomas said that in a phone call from australia , watson claimed his wife gave him a thumbs up underwater , indicating she wanted to go back to the surface . watson said he was leading her back to a rope when she panicked , knocked off his mask and air hose , and began sinking , according to thomas .     but during a later talk at a lawyer ' s office , thomas said , watson changed his story and said the woman indicated she wanted to go back to the rope leading to the top rather than go directly to the surface . staring directly at watson from the witness stand , thomas said he asked his former son-in-law at that time : \" when tina gave him the thumbs up sign to go to the surface , why didn ' t he just take her to the surface ? \"     the judge blocked thomas from testifying about watson ' s alleged desire to increase the woman ' s life insurance policy , a blow for prosecutors who earlier had been barred from presenting other evidence about watson ' s actions after the death .     montre carodine , a law professor at the university of alabama , said the judge ' s decision to end the trial without the defense even presenting evidence was a \" serious indictment \" of the prosecution ' s case , particularly considering it was a capital trial .     \" it means the evidence was weak , \" she said .\n"}], "bhushan": [{"url": "file://test/54/0/0", "title": "test/54/0/0",

political futures .     \u201cyou should reconsider running for your seat , \u201d lopez-cantera told rubio as they sat in the senator \u2019 s pickup truck about an hour before sunset , after witnessing the aftermath of the deadliest mass shooting in u.s. history .     story continued below     rubio was caught off guard . after all , lopez-cantera has been running for his senate seat in a crowded gop primary for more than a year \u2014 with rubio \u2019 s encouragement .     lopez-cantera made clear he was still fully committed to running , even as he initiated a gut-check moment for both of them . until then , rubio had resisted the entreaties of senate leaders and donors to rethink retiring from the senate . lopez-cantera \u2019 s conversation removed one of the biggest obstacles to rubio running again : a longtime friendship that he wouldn \u2019 t want to ruin due to political ambition .     \u201ci don \u2019 t want you to feel like you have to say that because of outside pressure , \u201d rubio responded .     but lopez-cantera said he felt \u201ccompelled \u201d to continue talking it through . the two of them were shaken by what they saw in orlando , the bloody sidewalks and the ashen faces of local , state and federal authorities .     \u201cthis is bigger than me . and this isn \u2019 t about me . and it \u2019 s not about you . it \u2019 s about our country and this election , \u201d lopez-cantera said to rubio , recounting the conversation for politico . \u201cit \u2019 s deeply consequential . \u2026 in the current field , i \u2019 m the best candidate in the general election . but i \u2019 m not looking at this through rose-colored glasses. \u201d     bottom line , lopez-cantera said in the interview : \u201cnothing has changed . i \u2019 m still running . marco isn \u2019 t. \u201d     the filing deadline for the race is june 24 , when rubio is scheduled to hold a fundraiser for lopez-cantera . if rubio decides to run , lopez-cantera won \u2019 t file . right now , longtime friends of both men believe rubio ultimately won \u2019 t run : the lure of a much bigger paycheck and proximity to his family will outweigh another term in the senate .     but in the next breath , they say no one really knows what rubio will do , except the senator himself \u2014 and even he might still be agonizing over the decision .     \u201ci \u2019 ll go home later this week , i \u2019 ll have some time with my family , \u201d rubio told reporters in the capitol on wednesday as he headed to a classified briefing on the orlando attacks . \u201cif there \u2019 s been a change in our status , i \u2019 ll be sure to let everyone know. \u201d     polling shows rubio is the strongest republican in a potential race against the democrats \u2019 strongest candidate , rep. patrick murphy , in a contest that could decide control of the senate .     the republican senate race is crowded . and the full-court press to recruit rubio to run for reelection has frozen fundraising and dampened republican enthusiasm for all five major gop candidates for the seat . none is as well known as rubio .     some republican and conservative groups have suggested they won \u2019 t spend big in florida , while more donors will give to oppose rubio in order to hand him his second defeat in a year and brand him a double loser after his crushing loss in the presidential primary .     as part of the maneuvers to get rubio to reverse course , lopez-cantera and allies of his and rubio \u2019 s say the amount of disinformation spread by party insiders has been somewhere between staggering and absurd .     for weeks , lopez-cantera and rubio had privately mocked the rumors of them striking a deal or hatching some elaborate plot . in one telling , rubio would run for reelection , win and then resign before the 2020 presidential election cycle , at which point lopez-cantera would run for his seat . in another version , lopez-cantera agreed with moneyed interests to drop out of the senate race , endorse rubio and then run for chief financial officer in 2018.     all of it is false , lopez-cantera said .     \u201cthere is no deal . there is no plan , \u201d lopez-cantera said . \u201cnone of it is true . anyone who says that is lying and doesn \u2019 t know what they \u2019 re talking about. \u201d     but those who haven \u2019 t been privy to the two friends \u2019 talks have been deeply skeptical about what they \u2019 re up to . and if rubio ultimately runs and lopez-cantera doesn \u2019 t , some of the rumors will appear true .     \u201cyou can \u2019 t tell me this hasn \u2019 t been orchestrated , \u201d said one republican who supports one of lopez-cantera \u2019 s rivals in the senate race said , echoing democrats . \u201cmarco is running and you can talk about all the friendship stuff you want , but this shows marco is all about marco. \u201d     the campaign of one of lopez-cantera \u2019 s republican opponents , developer carlos beruff , fell for one of the rumor-filled reports and issued a statement wednesday about rubio in which the candidate said voters are \u201csick of career politicians and power brokers in washington who care about one thing : holding on to power . but the voters of florida will not obey them . they don \u2019 t get to pick our candidates. \u201d     as for the other republican candidates , u.s. rep. david jolly said he \u2019 ll announce his plans friday . he might run for reelection to his tampa bay-area 13th congressional district seat . defense contractor todd wilcox indicated he \u2019 ll stay in the race with or without rubio , and those close to u.s. rep. ron desantis say he \u2019 d give strong consideration to running for reelection in the 6th congressional district if rubio runs .     lopez-cantera acknowledges that his decision to bring up the race \u2014 especially after witnessing the aftermath of the carnage at the pulse nightclub \u2014 put unexpected extra pressure on rubio .     rubio \u2019 s plans since last spring were to win the white house or return home to west miami , where he lives less than a half-hour away from lopez-cantera \u2019 s coral gables home . rubio has hired washington dealmaker robert barnett to field job offers and get the biggest payday possible , without lobbying or working on wall street . he also planned to hit the paid-speaker circuit .     after two years , if hillary clinton wins this election , rubio is expected to begin mounting a challenge to her in 2020.     \u201cmarco ran for president as a senator and we saw how that played out , \u201d said one backer . \u201cthis is his chance to be at home , spend time with jeannette [ rubio \u2019 s wife ] and their kids and make some real money so he can put all four of them through private college in the northeast if he wants to . people forget he \u2019 s the son of blue-collar immigrants . things like this are more important to him than politics. \u201d     lopez-cantera , who is also married and has two children , emphasized the importance of family to rubio .     \u201cuntil i mentioned this , he was really committed to spending time with his kids , being able to be home for more than 10 days without having to go somewhere on the campaign trail or back to washington . he looked forward to coaching his son \u2019 s football team , \u201d lopez-cantera said .     miami-dade county commissioner steve bovo , whose wife works as a policy adviser for rubio , said he wasn \u2019 t surprised by lopez-cantera \u2019 s discussion . bovo served in the florida house when lopez-cantera was majority leader just after rubio left as florida house speaker , a post he held in 2007-08.     \u201ccarlos is not only thinking about their friendship but the country , \u201d bovo said . \u201cwe all know each other , go to each others \u2019 kids \u2019 birthday parties . in the difficult business we \u2019 re in , we separate the friendship and the politics . but we never do anything to endanger our friendship. \u201d     one rubio insider said he believes rubio should run for reelection because , as a senator , he \u2019 ll have more ability to affect policy he cares about , raise money and draw attention .     \u201cfrom a political perspective , this is about having a platform , \u201d the republican said . \u201cwhen cnn calls , does the booker want former sen. marco rubio or do they want , say , current sen. tom cotton ? \u201d     a member of the committee on foreign relations and select committee on intelligence , rubio has made foreign policy a specialty . and , friends say , he \u2019 ll miss getting classified briefings and being in a position to do something about it .     about 12 hours after rubio and lopez-cantera spoke on sunday , the senator was interviewed by conservative radio show host hugh hewitt , who likes to talk about foreign policy and the threat of terrorism . hewitt unexpectedly switched gears on rubio by asking whether the terrorist attack changed \u201cin any way your resolve not to seek reelection. \u201d     briefly caught flat-footed , rubio said \u201ci \u2019 ve been deeply impacted by it . i think when it visits your home state , and it impacts a community you know well , it really gives you pause to think a little bit about , you know , your service to your country and where you can be most useful to your country. \u201d     \u201ci have a friend of mine who is running for the u.s. senate , \u201d rubio said later . \u201cso i want to be fair , hugh . i haven \u2019 t thought about it in that context . i really don \u2019 t want to link the two things right now , because i don \u2019 t want politics to intrude in all of this. \u201d     by then , though , it was too late .     \u201ci brought this up . it wasn \u2019 t mutual , \u201d lopez-cantera said . \u201che is in a position where he will make a decision . we \u2019 re friends . we support each other. \u201d             seung min kim contributed to this report .\n"}, {"url": "file://test/54/1/1", "title": "test/54/1/1", "content": "how many
