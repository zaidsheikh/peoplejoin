state vaccine mandates . recent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in the united states have drawn attention to this phenomenon . improved understanding of the association between vaccine refusal and the epidemiology of these diseases is needed .     objective to review the published literature to evaluate the association between vaccine delay , refusal , or exemption and the epidemiology of measles and pertussis , 2 vaccine-preventable diseases with recent us outbreaks .     evidence review search of pubmed through november 30 , 2015 , for reports of us measles outbreaks that have occurred since measles was declared eliminated in the united states ( after january 1 , 2000 ) , endemic and epidemic pertussis since the lowest point in us pertussis incidence ( after january 1 , 1977 ) , and for studies that assessed disease risk in the context of vaccine delay or exemption .     findings we identified 18 published measles studies ( 9 annual summaries and 9 outbreak reports ) , which described 1416 measles cases ( individual age range , 2 weeks-84 years ; 178 cases younger than 12 months ) and more than half ( 56.8 % ) had no history of measles vaccination . of the 970 measles cases with detailed vaccination data , 574 cases were unvaccinated despite being vaccine eligible and 405 ( 70.6 % ) of these had nonmedical exemptions ( eg , exemptions for religious or philosophical reasons , as opposed to medical contraindications ; 41.8 % of total ) . among 32 reports of pertussis outbreaks , which included 10 609 individuals for whom vaccination status was reported ( age range , 10 days-87 years ) , the 5 largest statewide epidemics had substantial proportions ( range , 24 % -45 % ) of unvaccinated or undervaccinated individuals . however , several pertussis outbreaks also occurred in highly vaccinated populations , indicating waning immunity . nine reports ( describing 12 outbreaks ) provided detailed vaccination data on unimmunized cases ; among 8 of these outbreaks from 59 % through 93 % of unvaccinated individuals were intentionally unvaccinated .     conclusions and relevance a substantial proportion of the us measles cases in the era after elimination were intentionally unvaccinated . the phenomenon of vaccine refusal was associated with an increased risk for measles among people who refuse vaccines and among fully vaccinated individuals . although pertussis resurgence has been attributed to waning immunity and other factors , vaccine refusal was still associated with an increased risk for pertussis

( recreational use became legal in late 2012. )     replete with the denver \" 420 rally \" in civic center park , the high times cannabis cup -- an expo and a competition sponsored by the magazine -- and a 420 concert at red rocks amphitheatre headlined by snoop dogg , the weekend has drawn the trappings one might expect . dreadlocks . tie-dye . t-shirts brandishing phrases like \" cheech &amp; chong for president . \"     those predictable , or stereotypical , images , however , only tell part of the story .     they don ' t speak for the white-haired mississippi man who looked like he ' d walked out of a law firm on casual friday . they don ' t reflect what drew a crohn ' s disease patient from missouri . nor do they represent three older texas women , one with her nails perfectly manicured in hot pink and her hair done just so , who advocate on behalf of seniors and are working to reform marijuana laws .     \" we ' re not trying to force people to smoke pot , \" said dawn brooks , 62 , of austin , the one with the bright nails . \" cannabis is merely a plant . that ' s all it is . and more and more seniors are coming out of the closet . \"     this is a weekend that draws people of various backgrounds and with different needs and desires .     that said , for many of those who turned out saturday , the vast majority it seemed from out-of-state , it was all about the smoking . and for some of them , it was in a frenzied way -- a mad rush to try everything because they couldn ' t take any of it home .     kate , a 30-year-old from kansas city , missouri , was waiting with her boyfriend , scott , for a free bus ride to the cannabis cup expo at denver mart .     \" it ' s like his super bowl , \" said kate , who , like many people we spoke to , didn ' t want her last name used . \" he ' s been giddy about it for weeks . ... super stoked is an understatement . \"     bus to show , a nonprofit that works to reduce intoxicated driving , partnered with high times to offer transportation this weekend . it set up a downtown location for pickups and drop-offs outside cheba hut , a marijuana-themed sub shop .     besides the free shuttles to and from the expo , the organization sold out a $ 20-a-day hop-on , hop-off shuttle tour of what it called the cannabis freedom trail . the cannabus , as the tour shuttles are called , have been shepherding as many as 200 people a day to various cannabis dispensaries around town .     on one tour we joined , smoke wafted out windows . strangers shared pipes and exchanged samples of weed and wax , a concentrated form of marijuana . canisters of buds bearing names like \" tangerine haze \" and \" strawberry cough , \" were passed around to smell . nutella pancakes came up in conversations at least three times .     wearing a neon green wig and green power ranger mini-dress , teri starbird , 50 , who lives outside wichita , kansas , lit up some \" bruce banner . \" it is one of the contenders in this year ' s cannabis cup competition .     \" oh , that ' s very smooth , \" she said , passing the pipe to her friend . \" but i ' ll tell you what , there are some mad scientists in this town . some of this stuff makes you plain stupid . \"     while other groups actually visited dispensaries on the tour , no one in this crew bothered to get off the bus . two guys from south jersey sat dazed , staring out their windows .     \" i ' m too f**king stoned to get out , \" said a 22-year-old from new mexico , who donned a captain america baseball cap and heroically bounded over bus seats to take a hit of what others were smoking .     back at the sandwich shop , the final stop on the tour , he and the others had no choice but to stumble off the bus .     \" chaz \" shows off his marijuana-themed hat during the 420 rally at civic center park in denver .     inside cheba hut , where 12-inch subs are called \" blunts , \" drinks are listed as \" cotton mouth cures \" and desserts and chips fall under \" munchies , \" a woman from brooklyn , new york , stared up at the menu board -- her eyes as wide as her smile .     \" oh , my god , that bread ' s crazy , \" she said loudly to no one . \" oh , my god , they have kool-aid here ! what ? \"     outside , bus driver jody stonebraker called us on board for the free ride to the expo . she offered lighters and bottles of water to her passengers as she drove them to denver mart , where tens of thousands gathered for the high times cannabis cup . with bus windows open to keep her sober , she moved us on .     a guy from san francisco struggled to roll a joint ; when the bus stopped short , his weed went flying . a man from florida looked around at the peaceful , smiling faces of his fellow passengers and wanted to know where else people were this happy . and a conversation across the aisle between two people began and ended like this :     \" what was your favorite ? \"     \" green . \"     \" what ? \"     stonebraker , 54 , said she ' s met people this weekend from all over the country , even the world -- including germany , japan and mexico . she can ' t stop singing the praises of her cannabis-loving passengers .     \" it ' s been so fun , and i ' m getting paid for this , \" she said . \" i tended bar for 16 years , and they were all jerks . every other person , you wanted to shoot . you guys

draped in mardi gras beads . he wore a jester ' s hat ; she a crown made of plastic marijuana leaves . they were simply thrilled .     \" nobody ' s tripping . nobody ' s acting like you ' re from mars , \" joyce said . \" there ' s freedom to smoke . you don ' t have to hide in a basement or under a blanket . \"     the couple , married for 32 years , raised children successfully . sam spent 35 years working his tail off in the commercial roofing business .     \" so don ' t tell me it makes me lazy , \" he said .     in hallways outside the exhibition hall , people sat on the floor , tossing back small bags of cheetos and doritos . a man was hunched over in a corner , taking a nap . another guy greeted people just inside , offering patriotic-looking stickers that resembled those handed out on election day -- except these said \" i smoked . \"     a stroll past the booths in the packed hall offered a head-spinning glimpse into the big business that is cannabis .     there were hydrocarbon extraction machines , easy at-home growing systems , and high-powered leaf trimmers . there were academies offering certification courses , products to detoxify the body , and tips and tools to make edibles . there were cannabis-themed clothing companies , glass pipes available in all shapes -- including that of mr. potato head -- and people sitting beneath lights and in front of cameras for a segment of the plant channel .     there was even an agency called hemp temps , to meet the staffing needs of the growing industry .     behind the building , in a fenced-in outdoor area where 21-and-over wristbands were checked before entry , the smoke was thick .     attendees crowded couches beneath tents , sampling wares . a grown man , dressed as an oompa-loompa , walked by as another guy inhaled smoke from a three-foot-long bong . an emergency medical team tended to an older man who passed out , his head bleeding from when it hit the pavement after he smoked a dab , or

head . arapahoe county sheriff grayson robinson has said investigators think she was shot at random by pierson , who had gone into the school looking for a teacher with whom he had a dispute .     pierson may have been nursing a grudge against the teacher _ a librarian and head of the school debate team _ since september . pierson was on the team and had been disciplined by the librarian for reasons yet to be disclosed , the sheriff said . he said pierson threatened that teacher in september and came to the school friday intending to harm him and inflict numerous other casualties .     pierson excelled at speech and debate and was passionate about the team , friends said . they described him as a smart student who apparently didn ' t shirk from confrontations in class .     \" he ' s a funny kid . he ' s smart . he ' s in the eagle scouts , a very intelligent kid . did not like being wrong , \" said august clary , who was a friend of pierson . \" if you ' re arguing with him , it ' s going to be , that ' s a feat if you win an argument against him . \"     \" he would not be afraid to tell someone how he feels , \" said zach runberg , 18 , a senior in pierson ' s english class .     pierson legally bought a shotgun on dec. 6 at a local store , and he purchased ammunition the morning of the shootings . he managed to ignite a molotov cocktail inside the school library before he killed himself as a fast-acting school security officer , a deputy sheriff , closed in , robinson said .     that officer ' s aggressive response prevented more casualties , robinson said . it ' s a tactic adopted nationwide after columbine , in which first responders cordoned off the school before pursuing two student gunmen inside . the two killed 12 students and a teacher before killing themselves .     \" it ' s nice to see how well the system worked . it ' s a remarkable improvement from before . this could have been much , much worse , \" hickenlooper said .     after the aurora , colo. , theater shootings and the newtown , conn. , school shootings , colorado ' s democrat-led legislature this year implemented gun control measures that limited the size of ammunition magazines and instituted universal background checks . colorado also appropriated more than $ 20 million for mental health hotlines and local crisis centers .     the measures were intended to address violence associated with so-called assault rifles , not shotguns that are widely owned for hunting and sport .     hickenlooper acknowledged the latest shooting raised again questions about guns and violence . but he noted that pierson \" didn ' t seem to exhibit any signs of mental illness , \" and he cautioned that the investigation was in its early stages .     \" everyone in colorado is asking the same questions , \" the governor said . \" on the one hand there is a deeply held conviction for the freedoms laid out in the second amendment , but also a very , very strong conviction

u.s. outbreaks of measles and pertussis , a research review suggests .     a vial of measles , mumps and rubella vaccine and an information sheet is seen at boston children ' s hospital in boston , massachusetts february 26 , 2015. reuters/brian snyder     more than half of 1,416 measles cases reported in the u.s. since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000 were for people with no history of measles vaccination , the analysis found .     among more than 10,000 pertussis patients with known vaccination status , 24 to 45 percent of people in the five largest statewide epidemics since 1977 were unvaccinated or only partially vaccinated , the analysis also found .     \u201cif there are a high number of susceptible or unvaccinated individuals in the community the risk of getting infected \u2013 even for vaccinated children \u2013 goes up , \u201d said senior study author dr. saad omer , a pediatrics and epidemiology researcher at emory university in atlanta .     that \u2019 s because few vaccines are 100 percent effective , omer added by email .     with pertussis , or whooping cough , up to 2 percent of people who receive all five recommended vaccine doses on time may still get this bacterial infection of the lungs , according to the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention .     for measles , roughly 3 percent of people who receive both recommended doses of the vaccine may still get the virus , according to the cdc .     these numbers are a best case scenario , assuming that only people with medical reasons \u2013 like certain cancer treatments , rare allergies to vaccine ingredients , or diseases that compromise the immune system \u2013 forgo inoculations .     but the cdc reports that fewer than 1 percent of kids need to skip vaccines for medical reasons , based on data from mississippi and west virginia , states that only grant exemptions under these circumstances .     instead , omer and colleagues found that the majority of measles and pertussis cases in the outbreaks they analyzed were due to people intentionally skipping vaccinations .     among 970 measles cases with detailed vaccination data , 574 cases were unvaccinated people who were eligible to receive their shots , researchers report in the journal of the american medical association .     most of these unvaccinated people \u2013 405 of them \u2013 had nonmedical reasons for skipping vaccinations such as religious or philosophical objections , the analysis found .     for the subset of pertussis reports from outbreaks with detailed data on unvaccinated individuals , 59 to 93 percent of cases were for people who intentionally skipped their inoculations , the analysis also found .     several pertussis cases also cropped up in highly vaccinated communities , suggesting waning immunity against the disease , the researchers note .     limitations of the study include a focus on measles and pertussis in the context of vaccine exemption rates , which may have underestimated the disease risk associated with skipping vaccines , the authors point out .     nonmedical exemptions also don \u2019 t explain all of the resurgence in measles and pertussis in recent years , dr. matthew davis , a pediatrics researcher and deputy director of the institute for healthcare policy and innovation at the university of michigan in ann arbor , noted in an editorial .     \u201cit is very difficult to put a specific number on how much vaccine refusals reduce a community \u2019 s protection against disease , \u201d davis said by email .     \u201cwhat this latest comprehensive review illustrates is that individuals who refuse vaccines not only put themselves at risk for disease , \u201d davis added . \u201cit turns out that they also put others at risk too \u2013 even people who have been vaccinated before , but whose protection from those vaccinations may not be as strong as it used to be. \u201d     source : bit.ly/1rj5jht jama , online march
