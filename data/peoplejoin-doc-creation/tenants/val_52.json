directs the center for bloodless medicine and surgery at allegheny general hospital in pittsburgh .     he ' s also an active big-game hunter , according to safari outfitters and bow-hunting sites where kill shots identify \" dr. jan seski \" as the man standing next to slain animals including elephants , a hippo , an ostrich and antelopes such as an impala , a kudu , and a nyala .     the associated press called and knocked on the door at seski ' s home , which is set back among some woods outside pittsburgh . the ap also left a message with an answering service for his medical practice , with no immediate response .     one image on the melorani safaris facebook page , since taken down , showed seski posing with the body of a small antelope in 2012 , with a caption saying it was killed two days after he shot it with an arrow . other captions described how his arrows penetrated organs and split bones .     \" this zimbabwe elephant is the sixth african elephant shot by

scrubs . his address and other identifying information given by authorities in zimbabwe matches those of u.s. medical authorities .     a handful of seski ' s neighbors said he mostly keeps to himself and that he ' d been buying up the land around his property . ernest hahn said seski put up no-trespassing signs , breaking the rural area ' s tradition of people feeling free to cross property lines to hunt .     hahn said seski can be \" quirky , \" walking around wearing a low-slung pistol \" like a gunslinger , \" for example , but he appreciates that his neighbor is protecting land from development .     \" it seemed to me everything he does is aboveboard , \" hahn said . \" i ' ve never seen him done anything illegal or unsportsmanlike at all . \"     seski provided his name and other identifying information for a government database when he came for the hunt , zimbabwe national parks spokeswoman caroline washaya moyo said .     \" when hunters come into the country they fill a document stating their personal details , the amount they have paid for the hunt , the number of animals to be hunted , the species to be hunted and the area and period where that hunt is supposed to take place , \" she said . \" the american conducted his hunt in an area where lion hunting is outlawed . the landowner who helped him with the hunt also did not have a have a quota for lion hunting . \"     seski seemed like a \" perfect gentleman \" to stewart dorrington , who operates melorani safaris and owns a game reserve in neighboring south africa where seski hunted in 2012.     \" he was a great guy , \" dorrington said . \" everything he did was perfectly legal and aboveboard and a great help to our conservation efforts . \"     dorrington said he converted his cattle ranch into a game reserve in the 1980s . he said funds from trophy hunting of antelope are essential to conserving wildlife .     dorrington said he received an abusive phone call sunday ; his facebook page was later closed from view after people began posting threatening comments .     two other illegal lion hunts also were recorded last year in zimbabwe , said geoffrey matipano , conservation director for the wildlife authority . he did not provide details on those cases .     zimbabwean authorities have said they will seek the extradition of minnesota dentist walter james palmer , alleging he lacked authorization to kill \" cecil . \" the lion was lured out of hwange park , wounded with a bow and arrow and then tracked down and shot , conservationists said .     palmer said he relied on professional guides to ensure his hunt was legal . two zimbabwean citizens were arrested and face charges .     zimbabwe ' s wildlife authority has suspended the hunting of lions , leopards and elephants in the hwange area , and said saturday that bow and arrow hunts can be approved by only by the head of the wildlife authority .     in washington , meanwhile , u.s. sen. robert menendez ,

of its security operation .     the distributed denial of service attack which overwhelmed the servers at sony and microsoft appears to have been on a very large scale , and came when traffic would have already been very high .     but customers are just as angry with lizard squad , the group which claims it launched the attack - and has since justified it with some rather pompous statements about exposing poor security .     the group now appears to have set its sights on bringing down tor , the secure network which enables anonymous online communication . that has incurred the wrath of
