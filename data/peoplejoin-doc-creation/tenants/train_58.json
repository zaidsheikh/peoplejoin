penitentiary .     related merle haggard : ' prison is the biggest business in america ' country music ' s most famous ex-con speaks out on the number of americans in prison and changes his stance on marijuana     while he was behind bars , coe penned several songs that would be released on his 1969 debut album , the dark and crudely recorded penitentiary blues , which resurfaced in 2005 getting its first cd release . coe was encouraged to write the songs , which detail stark prison life in such songs as \" death row , \" \" oh warden \" and \" cell #33 , \" by the man in the cell next to him , soul singer screamin ' jay hawkins . after he was released in 1967 , coe released those tracks via shelby singleton ' s sss international label , and began touring with b.b . king and the staples singers . a subsequent deal with columbia records yielded the mysterious rhinestone cowboy , a hardcore country effort co-produced by billy sherrill and ron bledsoe , which failed to chart .     the next album from coe , once upon a rhyme , would give him the first of his three top ten hits . \" you never even called me by my name \" was a stone-country , semi-novelty song written by steve goodman ( \" city of new orleans \" ) and john prine ( who refused a writer ' s credit but was gifted a jukebox by goodman for his contribution ) . in the second verse of the tune , coe namechecks

by willie nelson , and coe even namechecks himself . the fourth and final verse has coe explaining , in a spoken intro , how goodman wrote to him telling him he felt he had written \" the perfect country and western song \" with this one . coe further explains that he wrote back to goodman and protested that the song was missing key elements that would make it perfect : mama , trains , trucks , prison and getting drunk . goodman then rewrote the tune , resulting in one of the most iconic \u2013 and hilarious \u2013 verses in country music history .     recorded on august 20th , 1974 , \" you never even called me by my name , \" would debut on the billboard country chart in july 1975 , eventually peaking at number eight . although he wrote much of his own material , ironically , coe ' s only number one hit came in 1978 as the writer of johnny paycheck ' s number one smash , \" take this job and shove it . \" he would score another pair of top five hits as an artist with songs he didn ' t write : \" the ride \" in 1983 , and his biggest solo hit , \" mona lisa lost her smile , \" which just missed the top spot , peaking at number two .     coe , who appeared in the 1981 film based on \" take this job and shove it , \" would later tour with kid rock , writing \" single father \" for him in 2003. he also worked with members of the metal band pantera on an lp released in 2006 , and he remains notorious for several x-rated songs he recorded while reportedly riding as a member of an outlaw biker gang .     this rare clip [ above ] of \" you never even called me by my
