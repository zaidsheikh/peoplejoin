will be invited to change into a more \" respectful \" costume     the mayor of cannes in southern france has banned full-body swimsuits known as \" burkinis \" from the beach , citing public order concerns .     david lisnard said they are a \" symbol of islamic extremism \" and might spark scuffles , as france is the target of islamist attacks .     france is on high alert following a series of incidents including july ' s truck attack in nearby nice .     anyone caught flouting the new rule could face a fine of \u20ac 38 ( \u00a3 33 ) .     they will first be asked to change into another swimming costume or leave the beach .     nobody has been apprehended for wearing a burkini in cannes since the edict came into force at the end of july .     what do muslim women think of the ban ?     this is not the first time that women ' s clothing has been restricted in france . in 2011 it became the first country in europe to ban the full-face islamic veil , known as the burka , as well as the partial face covering , the niqab .     earlier this week a private waterpark near marseille cancelled a burkini-only day after being subjected to criticism .     image copyright getty images image caption the authorities will need to distinguish between swimmers in burkinis and wetsuits     the ruling     \" access to beaches and for swimming is banned to any person wearing improper clothes that are not respectful of good morals and secularism .     \" beachwear which ostentatiously displays religious affiliation , when france and places of worship are currently the target of terrorist attacks , is liable to create risks of disrupting public order . \"     the reaction in the french press     the french media has questioned the legality of the ban . le monde points out that no french law bans the wearing of full-body swimsuits . \" the law on the full-face veil only bans covering the face in public ... the burkini , which covers the body but does not hide the face , is thus a totally legal garment . \"     france tv info ' s legal blog , judge marie , says the risk of disturbing public order , invoked by the cannes mayor , seems rather tenuous . \" the basic freedom to come and go dressed as you please seems to me to be infringed in a way that is disproportionate to this risk , \" the blog says .     meanwhile , a commentary in left-of-centre paper liberation accuses the cannes mayor of trying to score a political point : \" david lisnard \u2026 is not responding to a specific issue , but is sending a radical message to his constituents , to his electorate . \"     bbc monitoring     mr lisnard confirmed to local media that other religious symbols such as the kippah ( jewish skullcap ) and the cross would still be permitted , and the ban would not apply to the veil that some muslim women wear over their hair .     he said : \" i simply forbid a uniform that is the symbol of islamic extremism .     \" we live in a common public space , there are rules to follow . \"     the league of human rights ( ldh ) said it would challenge the ban in court .     \" it is time for politicians in this region to calm their discriminatory ardour and defend the spirit of the republic , \" local ldh leader herve lavisse said .     the collective against islamophobia in france ( ccif ) is also expected to mount a legal challenge against the decision . its lawyer sefen guez guez called the ban \" illegal , discriminatory and unconstitutional \" .\n"}, {"url": "file://train/61/2/2", "title": "train/61/2/2", "content": "story highlights \"

scrapped a planned vote late tuesday on a massive aid package for superstorm sandy victims .     \" we ' re getting what new york and new jersey need , and that ' s all that counts , \" rep. peter

said .     \" on the second tranche , we will need to see more details before we decide how to proceed , \" the aide said . \" as the senate has shown by passing our bipartisan bill , we consider getting aid to the victims of sandy a superlative priority , but we need to know more about the contents of the bill before deciding on a path forward . \"     democrats were less mollified .     \" while it would have been far better had they passed the senate ' s bill today , at least this provides a path to produce the needed $ 60 billion for new york and new jersey by the end of the month ,

day over congress ' inaction on the package , pitting even fellow republicans against boehner .     it was \" disappointing and disgusting to watch , \" said new jersey gov . chris christie , blaming \" the toxic internal politics of the house majority . \"     \" new jersey deserves better than the duplicity we saw on display , \" he said , adding , \" shame on congress . \"     christie , a republican , said he had tried to reach boehner on tuesday night after the latter canceled a vote on the aid bill , which had already been approved by the senate . \" he did not take my calls , \" said christie .     in a news conference , christie said he joined people of his state in feeling \" betrayed \" and added that the move summarizes \" why the american people hate congress . \"     in a statement , christie and new york gov . andrew cuomo wrote : \" this failure to come to the aid of americans following a severe and devastating natural disaster is unprecedented . the fact that days continue to go by while people suffer , families are out of their homes , and men and women remain jobless and struggling during these harsh winter months is a dereliction of duty . \"     boehner did not make public remarks and did not post about the issue on social media .     gop leadership sources said boehner was worried it would be a bad political move for him to allow a vote on the new federal spending after a long day of getting pummeled by his own house republicans for not demanding enough spending cuts in the fiscal cliff bill .     civility was restored late in the afternoon . \" as far as i ' m concerned , that was a lifetime ago , \" king said . \" i know it was last night , but the bottom line is we ' re going forward getting what we believe is necessary . \"     earlier , king had slammed his own party . \" the republican party has said it ' s the party of ' family values . ' last night , it turned its back on the most essential value of all , and that ' s to provide food , shelter , clothing and relief for people who have been hit by a natural disaster , \" king told cnn .     king said he chased boehner \" all over the house last night \" and that boehner had said everything would be taken care of after the vote on the fiscal cliff . but boehner left .     king called the house leadership ' s move a \" knife in the back . \"     \" anyone from new york or new jersey who contributes one penny to the republican congressional campaign committee should have their head examined , \" king said . it ' s very rare for a lawmaker to call on anyone not to support his own party .     but on wednesday afternoon , king said he would vote for boehner in leadership elections scheduled for thursday .     a senior gop leadership aide said boehner will make a sandy aid package \" his first priority in the new congress , \" which begins its term thursday .     when a new congress begins , both chambers have to begin from scratch with legislation , so the senate ' s passage of a previous bill will be moot .     michael steel , boehner ' s spokesman , said the speaker is \" committed to getting this bill passed this month . \"     before the house adjourned wednesday , president barack obama urged a vote .     \" it has only been two months since hurricane sandy devastated communities across new york , new jersey , and connecticut as well as other eastern states . our citizens are still trying to put their lives back together , \" obama said in a statement .     \" when tragedy strikes , americans come together to support those in need . i urge republicans in the house of representatives to do the same , bring this important request to a vote today , and pass it without delay for our fellow americans , \" obama said .     scott mandel , vice president of new york ' s long beach city council , told cnn , \" the money was needed yesterday , and the fact that there ' s an obstacle in the way for whatever reason and a vote wasn ' t allowed to go forward was inexcusable . \"     the money would improve the city ' s ability to withstand damage from winter storms , mandel said .     fiscal cliff battle held up the measure     the tumultuous process of getting the fiscal cliff deal passed in the house had held up the relief measure , and many house republicans opposed the size of the senate bill .     \" leadership was all-consumed with the cliff procedure , \" rogers told reporters off the house floor late tuesday . \" and they really have not had the time to devote to this because of that . \"     sandy killed at least 113 people in the united states and left millions of people without power after running up the east coast in late october . the storm hit hardest in new york and new jersey .     cuomo has put storm-related costs at $ 41.9 billion , while christie has estimated a price tag of $ 36.8 billion .     the bill includes grant funding for owners of homes and businesses , as well as funding for public improvement projects on the electrical grid , hospitals and transit systems to prevent damage from future storms .     john stone , a resident of new york ' s staten island , owned two homes before the storm . one was destroyed ; the other was so severely flooded that it remains unlivable .     but he expressed no anger over the house ' s decision . \" they ' ll just have to do it all over again , i suppose . what can you say ? \"     \" it ' s a lot of money , \" he said , adding \" there ' s a lot of other things they ' ve got to do . \"     he tends to vote republican and doesn ' t plan to turn away from the party , he said , although , he added , \" i don ' t give them much money anyway .

christie , speaking the day after the republican-controlled house of representatives refused to take up the $ 60 billion relief measure already passed by the senate , said culpability for sustained distress in his state rested solely upon gop lawmakers .         \" there is only one group to blame for the continued suffering of these innocent victims : the house majority and their speaker , john
