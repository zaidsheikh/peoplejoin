\u201cgrey \u2019 s anatomy \u201d to \u201cscandal. \u201d     her shingle , shondaland , will begin producing new series for netflix while she continues to stay involved in her current broadcast series . executive producer betsy beers will also come to netflix with rhimes , one of the most successful tv producers of the past decade .     \u201cshonda rhimes is one of the greatest storytellers in the history of television , \u201d said ted sarandos , chief content officer , netflix , in a statement . \u201cher work is gripping , inventive , pulse-pounding , heart-stopping , taboo-breaking television at its best . i \u2019 ve gotten the chance to know shonda and she \u2019 s a true netflixer at heart \u2014 she loves tv and films , she cares passionately about her work , and she delivers for her audience . we \u2019 re so excited to welcome her to netflix. \u201d     rhimes has been a consistent supplier of successful dramas for abc , including most recently \u201chow to get away with murder \u201d and \u201cscandal. \u201d her first series for abc , medical drama \u201cgrey \u2019 s anatomy , \u201d was a home run out of the gate and is heading in to its 14th season this fall . a \u201cgrey \u2019 s anatomy \u201d spinoff is also in the works .     netflix is familiar with the shondaland milieu . the streaming service has long carried older episodes of \u201cgrey \u2019 s anatomy , \u201d \u201cscandal \u201d and \u201chtgawm \u201d in the u.s. , and in select markets around the world .     the rhimes pact reflects netflix \u2019 s increasing interest in producing original series the company can own , as well as the arms race continuing to escalate between not only the streaming service and tv networks , but other subscriber vod options like amazon prime and hulu . earlier this week , amazon signed on another proven hitmaker , robert kirkman , creator of amc \u2019 s megahit \u201cthe walking dead. \u201d     netflix has been a whirlwind of activity as of late , signing filmmakers joel and ethan coen to a deal for a series , \u201cthe ballad of buster scruggs. \u201d the company also just made its first acquisition , millarworld , which will yield intellectual property from a roster of comics that have yielded movies in the past from \u201ckickass \u201d to the \u201ckingsman \u201d franchise .     the wall street journal first reported the news . financial terms of the deal were not disclosed rhimes was earning an estimated $ 10 million a year under her previous abc studios pact . netflix undoubtedly is paying a premium to rhimes and in overhead for shondaland to bring her into the fold under the exclusive deal . the complicated deal is believed to include innovative backend profit definitions for rhimes to accommodate for the lack of syndication opportunities for programs produced for netflix \u2019 s global platform . the deal was hammered out by rhimes \u2019 longtime reps at icm partners and attorney michael gendler .     the deal has been in the works for months . rhimes \u2019 existing pact with abc studios had been set to expire in june 2018. it \u2019 s understood that rhimes let the studio know some time ago that she intended to move on after the deal ended \u2014 not to a direct broadcast competitor but to a new chapter of her career . at that point , discussions ensued to allow rhimes an early exit from the deal .     the shondaland operation is expected to remain based out of sunset gower studios in hollywood , where \u201cscandal \u201d and \u201chow to get away with murder \u201d are shot .     \u201cshondaland \u2019 s move to netflix is the result of a shared plan ted sarandos and i built based on my vision for myself as a storyteller and for the evolution of my company , \u201d said rhimes in a statement . \u201cted provides a clear , fearless space for creators at netflix. \u201d     \u201ci am a huge fan of the talented team and amazing programming at netflix , \u201d said beers . \u201cthe ability to create content for our new partners is an exciting challenge . i am grateful to everyone at abc for their continued support and i look forward to beginning this next chapter at netflix. \u201d     the network and studio arms of abc issued statements thanking rhimes for her work for the disney-owned tv properties , and assuring that the \u201ctgit \u201d lineup is to continue airing . \u201d i \u2019 m proud to have given a home to what have become some of the most celebrated and talked about shows on television , \u201d said abc entertainment president channing dungey . \u201cwith the launch of a new season upon us , fans can rest assured that tgit remains intact and will be as buzzed about as ever. \u201d     a good deal of rhimes-related series are still in the pipeline at abc studios , which also has numerous overall deals with showrunners associated with her shows . another shondaland series , \u201cfor the people , \u201d is expected to bow in the midseason . rhimes is committed to maintaining her involvement in the \u201ctgit \u201d series . she \u2019 s taking a hands-on role in the final season of \u201cscandal. \u201d she hammered out the roadmap for the washington , d.c.-based sudser and is said to be penning multiple episodes .     but for rhimes , the move to netflix offers a chance to work in a variety of genres and formats that are beyond the scope of broadcast tv . in netflix \u2019 s subscription environment , there \u2019 s more creative freedom to produce limited and recurring series of various episode lengths , and there \u2019 s flexibility even in the length of each episode . that is attractive to rhimes . the producer has already proved herself in the broadcast arena , breaking ground with \u201cscandal \u201d and \u201chtgawm \u201d in fielding series with african-american female leads .     the netflix deal comes just days after abc \u2019 s parent company seemed to have done the streaming service the disservice of opting not to renew disney and pixar movies when their licenses expire in 2019. the conglomerate also just announced plans to launch a pair of new streaming services , one from espn and another with a mix of disney-related content that could provide a challenger to netflix .     but disney ceo bob iger played down the notion of any rivalry between the two companies , noting a range of other pacts that are still in place . disney and netflix are also negotiating over the future of films currently on the streaming service from lucasfilm and marvel .
