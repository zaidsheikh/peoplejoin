comprehensive census of house-dwelling arthropods .     some are part of an intricate ecosystem that relies on crumbs and nail clippings for food . others are accidental visitors trapped in this strange and dangerous world , unbeknownst to most homeowners .     advertisement     the survey found 579 species , mainly insects , spiders , beetles , mites , flies and ants , in 50 detached houses in the leafy suburbs of raleigh , north carolina . \u201cthe residents were really surprised and often horrified that we found so much , so we had to calm them down by saying it was normal , \u201d says matt bertone of north carolina state university in raleigh , who led the survey .     he says the results dispel ideas that modern homes are sterile deserts , showing instead that they teem with unseen life . \u201cthe biggest surprise was finding at least one species in almost every room , with only five of the 554 rooms drawing a blank , \u201d says bertone . some have adapted to live in human homes permanently , such as cobweb spiders and booklice .     bertone says that the species the team spotted most frequently are known to be abundant worldwide , but the exact proportions of creatures found in this suburb may differ from those in inner-city tower blocks or rural houses .     home ecosystem     the arthropods were found anywhere from carpets and floorboard cracks to shelves and skirting boards .     the good news is that most are unlikely to harm you or your house . in fact , many pest species , such as bed bugs or german cockroaches , were absent from most of the houses .     the only creatures found in every home were ants , carpet beetles , cobweb spiders and gall midges . \u201cthey rely on things we produce or have in our homes , \u201d says bertone .     taken together , these regulars form a neat ecosystem , with spiders and centipedes as apex predators , hunting smaller fry such as carpet beetles and other spiders .     the carpet beetles and book lice do much of the clearing up , scavenging dead insects , moulds and algae , as well as polishing off food crumbs and detritus from our own bodies , including nail clippings , hair and dead skin . some carpet beetles live on and consume spiders \u2019 webs .     personal jungle     other species , such as house flies , stray in temporarily , maybe for food or warmth in harsh weather . still others come in by accident and are usually trapped and doomed once indoors .     \u201cthe indoor environment has proved to be full of unexpected biological diversity and houses are our own personal jungles , \u201d says anne madden of the university of colorado at boulder . \u201cwe clearly have much to learn about the potential food webs in our homes. \u201d     \u201cunderstanding the life that permeates our dwellings is essential to establishing the influence of our indoor life on our health , \u201d says jack gilbert of argonne national laboratory in illinois . \u201cinsects have their own bacteria and move them round a house , so by understanding their biodiversity , we can better explain the distribution of microbes around our homes. \u201d     another recent survey of 1200 households across the united states found that household dust holds an average of 9000 different species of bacteria and fungi .     gallery     see seven of the creepy-crawlies found lurking in homes

"obama spokesman : that romney birth certificate joke is \u201cgutterball politics \u201d     posted at 4 : 17 pm on august 24 , 2012 by allahpundit     in case you \u2019 re wondering what it takes to offend a campaign whose allies have accused romney of tax evasion based on anonymous \u201csources \u201d and blamed him for leaving a steelworker \u2019 s wife to die from cancer uninsured , here you go . turns out obama , whose major contribution to deficit reduction this past year was the fiscal joke known as the \u201cbuffett rule , \u201d is running a serious , substantive campaign while romney , who just took up the sword of entitlement reform by picking paul ryan , is all about smears and distractions . the things you learn on msnbc .     two points . one : i don \u2019 t get why romney would step on his own message to make a birth certificate joke . he \u2019 s spent the past week neck-deep in culture-war quicksand thanks to todd akin and is looking at another week of it once the democratic convention opens . he could have used today to talk about unemployment or his energy policy or whatever , but instead he chose to throw the press some chum with this . ( one of his aides told buzzfeed that the line wasn \u2019 t in romney \u2019 s prepared remarks but was delivered off-the-cuff . i \u2019 ll bet. ) the point , i guess , is to prove that he \u2019 s capable of being politically incorrect by tweaking the media on a subject that makes them hyperventilate like almost nothing else , but anyone who cares much about that was voting for him already . it \u2019 s hard enough for romney to break through the media \u2019 s wall of nonsense to reach voters . why hand them another brick ?     two : this is the perfect ending to a week marked by criticism from jake tapper and , more tepidly , chuck todd that the media isn \u2019 t doing its job . from the moment this sentence escaped romney \u2019 s lips , it was a metaphysical certainty that it would dominate political coverage for the rest of the day , with msnbc \u2019 s pants-wetting expected to last well into the evening . no one expected otherwise even though everyone understands that few votes , if any , will shift because of this . when i started reading blogs years ago , it was relatively rare for reporters to admit that the media is biased or prone to trivial treatment of momentous events ; whenever a reporter or editor actually \u2018fessed up \u2014 the example that sticks in my mind was daniel okrent acknowledging the patently obvious fact that the nyt is a liberal newspaper \u2014 it was big news , a moral victory for conservatives who demanded that the press own up to its prejudices . these days , my sense is that they \u2019 re more willing to own up ( they have to be since there are so many more critics online cataloging them ) but that they \u2019 ve started to use their candor almost as an excuse to be as trivial as they want . sure , they \u2019 ll spend three days navel-gazing about romney \u2019 s dumb joke , but as long as todd or bob schieffer or some other big name tv journalist sighs afterward and admits that it \u2019 s silly to spend three days on this , well , then that \u2019 s proof that they have \u201cintegrity \u201d after all . three cheers for progress .     two clips for you here , one of obama \u2019 s flack checking the various talking-point boxes and the other , via the examiner , of msnbc being very msnbc-ish .     related posts :\n"}, {"url": "file://val/60/1/1", "title": "val/60/1/1", "content": "romney says \" birther

united states .     \" i love being home in this place where ann and i were raised , where both of us were born . ann was born in henry ford hospital . i was born in harper hospital , \" romney said

the sacrifices that our families made - coming to michigan , you know , it all sort of just washed over me as we got up on that stage , \" he said . \" it was a very emotional feeling . it ' s a feeling of coming home . \"     while romney ' s remarks may have amounted to an off-the-cuff joke , they elicited a swift and harsh response from the obama campaign .     \" throughout this campaign , governor romney has embraced the most strident voices in his party instead of standing up to them , \" obama campaign spokesman ben labolt emailed reporters . \" it ' s one thing to give the stage in tampa to donald trump , [ arizona ] sheriff [ joe ] arpaio , and [ kansas secretary of state ] kris kobach . but governor romney ' s decision to directly enlist himself in the birther movement should give pause to any rational voter across america . \"     the obama campaign also capitalized on the incident with a fundraising pitch to supporters . in an email with the subject line , \" a new low for mitt romney , \" campaign manager jim messina asked supporters to \" take a moment or two to think about [ romney ' s remark ] , what he ' s actually saying , and what it says about mitt romney . then make a donation of $ 5 or more to re-elect barack obama today . \"     the joke , in fact , was a departure from the way romney has typically handled the \" birther \" issue .     \" i think the citizenship test has been passed . i believe the president was born in the united states . there are real reasons to get this guy out of office , \" romney said in april 2011. romney this year defended his alliance with donald trump , an outspoken \" birther , \" but romney made clear he disagreed with trump on the issue .     when pelley asked romney if he agrees mr. obama is the \"

means available to us to gain information on their leadership and bring them to justice . in june 2014 , isil , also known as da \u2019 esh , seized control of portions of syria and iraq , self-declared a so-called islamic caliphate , and named al-baghdadi as caliph . in recent years , isil has gained the allegiance of jihadist groups and radicalized individuals around the world , and has inspired attacks in the united states .     under al-baghdadi , isil has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of civilians in the middle east , including the brutal murder of numerous civilian hostages from japan , the united kingdom , and the united states . the group also has conducted chemical weapons attacks in iraq and syria in defiance of the longstanding global norm against the use of these appalling weapons , and has enabled or directed terrorist attacks beyond the borders of its self-declared caliphate .     in 2011 , the department of state designated abu bakr al-baghdadi as a specially designated global terrorist under executive order 13224. al-baghdadi was also added to the united nations security council isil ( da \u2019 esh ) and al-qaida sanctions committee in 2011. al-baghdadi was the leader of al-qa \u2019 ida in iraq ( aqi ) , which subsequently morphed into isil .     more information about al-baghdadi is located on the rewards for justice
