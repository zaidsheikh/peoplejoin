coffee critics . where there is no disagreement , however , is that customers are still king \u2013 even in an indie/hipster coffee shop . it was disappointing , to say the least , the barista ,

would decide to take on more responsibility .     icao , composed of 191 signatory states , as well as global industry and aviation organizations , has a limited role . it cannot open or close air

eastern ukraine last week , killing 298 people . malaysia has said it was flying an icao-approved route , a misreading of the agency ' s role .     no one global body has overall responsibility for

voiced their concern over the deal in recent days to french foreign minister laurent fabius .     in the wake of the downing of a malaysian airliner last week , blamed by the united states on a russian missile system which it says was given to ukrainian pro-moscow separatists , eu foreign ministers agreed on tuesday to strengthen sanctions against russia .     but they remained divided as to how far to go , with british-led calls for an arms embargo putting france on the spot .     paris has a deal worth 1.2 billion euros ( $ 1.6 billion ) to supply russia with two mistral warships .     french president francois hollande on monday said the agreement was still in place , but added that delivery of the second mistral ship would \" depend on russia ' s attitude . \"     20.04 the real

additional information that supports what we have said . \"     harf repeated the u.s. belief that the plane , with nearly 300 people on board , was shot down by a russian-made sa-11 ground-to-air missile fired from an area controlled by separatists close to the russian border in eastern ukraine .     19.25 the delivery of french mistral-class warships to russia would be \" completely

domestic politics , in this particular situation is readily swallowing up the \u2018party line \u2019 of the department of state and the foreign office , demanding no proof of their claims . \"     it

shoigu and a shadowy muscovite millionaire for organising and financing \" illegal armed groups \" in ukraine , afp reports .     the investigation comes just over a month after russia launched an investigation of its own against ukraine ' s interior minister arsen avakov and a billionaire local governor over the killings of civilians and journalists in conflict-torn east ukraine .     avakov , who announced the move against the two russians , said in a statement that shoigu is suspected of having organised the \" illegal armed groups on ukrainian territory \" .     avakov added that insurgents \" commanded by russian citizens , systematically carried out armed attacks against \" ukrainian authorities , \" causing loss of life , destruction and other serious consequences . \"

high-level criticism of growing kremlin conservatism , kudrin said moscow should not intervene militarily in the rebellion in eastern ukraine and expressed dismay that russians were as once again becoming adversaries of the west .     kudrin , who repaired state finances after the chaos of the 1990s , told itar-tass news agency that russia risked taking a dangerous path internationally .     18.32 the president of the former soviet republic of lithuania , now an eu member , has accused france of pursuing a policy akin to the 1930s appeasement of nazi germany over its decision to go ahead

many family and friends .     no words can adequately express the sorrow the world feels over this loss . it is made more acute by the deep ties of friendship between our two countries .     bound by that friendship , we will not rest until we are certain that justice is done .     god bless , barack obama     18.13 nick collins has more information about the black box and the british investigators who will retrieve the data .     officials would not confirm when they expected to receive the black box and voice recorder but mark rutte , the dutch prime minister , said they had been on board a train carrying the bodies of victims which arrived in kharkiv , which is controlled by the ukrainian government , at 10.30am on tuesday .     britain was asked to retrieve the data because farnborough is one of only two facilities in europe with the capability to do so , sources said .     david barry , an air accident investigation expert at cranfield university , said the complexity of the process would depend on how much damage the two data recorders had sustained , although images suggest they are in good condition .     \u201cthey look reasonably intact so i would certainly expect [ investigators ] to be able to get data off them , \u201d he said . \u201cthey do not look like they have been stuck in fire for 12 hours. \u201d     in the best case scenario the recorders can simply be plugged into a computer and their data downloaded in binary form , before being converted by software into meaningful readings on the aircraft \u2019 s speed , altitude and other variables , he explained .     if the recorders have sustained damage experts will have to open them up and retrieve the circuit boards inside . if these are intact the data can be retrieved without too much difficulty , but if they too are compromised each memory chip will need to be individually examined \u2013 a process which could take weeks or even months .     it remains possible that separatists could have downloaded data from the recorders since recovering them several days ago , but any tampering would be immediately obvious , he added .     18.09 the national forensic investigation team ( ltfo ) will be in charge of identification , with 150 experts from defence , police , firefighters and dentists , forensic anthropologists and detection experts , ben farmer in donetsk and harriet alexander in amsterdam report .     family members had also all been asked to give dna samples to assist in the identification of the bodies .     hundreds of people are expected to join a candlelit procession through central amsterdam , described as a \u201csilent walk , \u201d to remember the victims tonight .     peter van lent , who organised the march , said he wanted people to wear something white and join the procession .     \u201cit \u2019 s in memory of those who died , \u201d he said . \u201cand to support their relatives at this terrible time. \u201d     17.49 the verdict in washington on the statement by eu foreign ministers on the mh17 crisis is basically a reserved judgment , peter foster says .     while the actual measures outlined by the eu are described as \" feeble \" by a senior official , the white house is taking some encouragement in the eu ' s promise to look at \" capital markets , defence , dual use goods , and sensitive technologies , including in the energy sector \" .     if the eu did adopt these kinds of measures , this would bring europe much more closely into line with the sanctions announced in by the obama administration on wednesday last week , a day before mh17 was shot down .     the question is whether what one senior us official called \" genuine european outrage \" over the downing of mh17 will translate into real action on europe ' s part . \" right now , we think it ' s a coin flip , \" according to my source .     meanwhile the us is continuing to debate the merits of tightening its own sanctions further , but imminent developments are not expected on that front , at least until european intentions have become clearer .     17.46 the united states says it is preparing to present data from the u.s. intelligence community laying out what ' s known about the malaysia airlines plane that was shot down in ukraine , ap reports .     white house spokesman josh earnest says the intelligence community will have some additional data to present . no additional details about what would be released were available .     earnest said the u.s. welcomes the news that most of the remains of the 298 killed have been handed over to authorities and the black boxes were transferred to dutch and malaysian authorities .     but he says the u.s. still hasn ' t seen the level of cooperation from russia and pro-russian separatists that it wants to see . earnest says international investigators led by the dutch still need full and immediate access to the crash site .

ukrainian border , use its influence on pro-russian separatists to grant international investigators full access to the crash site of flight mh17 ; and fully co-operate with the probe , martin banks

co-operation on the above mentioned demands fails to materialise . \"     the brussels based news website euobserver reported the exact proposals are to be tabled at a meeting of eu ambassadors in

reports .     at a highly-charged meeting on tuesday , they also decided to add more names and companies to an existing blacklist , which are to be agreed by the end of july .     speaking after the ministerial meeting in brussels , dutch foreign minister frans timmermans said : \" this [ the new eu threat ] is a logical consequence ... of the lack of progress that we have seen on the russian side \" since a previous ultimatum ran out at the end of june . \"     he said he was happy for the solidarity expressed by his colleagues and that the \" decision was reached unanimously . \"     17.12 britain wants to impose sanctions on the friends and allies of kremlin chief vladimir putin to pressure russia to stop meddling in ukraine , foreign secretary philip hammond said .     mr hammond said eu foreign ministers had agreed to look at an embargo on new arms sales to russia and to look at the possibility of restricting russian access to capital markets , financial services and to high-technology equipment used in the energy sector .     \" the word is ' cronies ' : the cronies of mr putin and his clique in the kremlin are the people who have to bear the pressure . if the

with them to ensure that loved ones are recovered , that a proper investigation is conducted and that ultimately justice is done . \"     17.04 the kremlin has said that vladimir putin had a telephone conversation with dutch pm mark rutte in a statement , harriet alexander reports .     the discussion focussed on the practical implementation of un security council resolution 2166 , adopted on july 21 in support of efforts to arrange a comprehensive , thorough and independent international investigation of the accident with the malaysian airlines jet that took place on july 17 in donetsk region .     17.03 the red cross has made a confidential legal assessment that ukraine is officially in a war , western diplomats and officials say , opening the door to possible war crimes prosecutions , including over the downing of malaysia airlines mh-17 .     \" clearly it ' s an internal conflict and therefore this is most probably a war crime , \" one western diplomat in geneva told reuters .     it comes after dutch prosecutors opened an investigation into the crash on suspicion of murder , war crimes and intentionally downing an airliner .     17.00 meanwhile reuters say the united states is continuing to review its sanctions on russia amid the conflict in ukraine , including the downed malaysian airliner shot down last week , and is willing to consider additional costs , the white house said .     the united states also would welcome additional steps to impose costs on russia , particularly from europe , white house spokesman josh earnest told reporters .     \" our willingness to consider adding additional costs is something that continues to be a live option , \" earnest said .     16.59 foreign secretary philip hammond said the uk wanted ' cronies ' around putin to bear the pressure of sanctions , according to reuters .     16.55 the full conclusions of the foreign affairs council meeting in brussels today can be read here .     but they are not likely to satisfy not the united states and more hawkish members of the eu , including poland and the baltic states , who lobbied for tough sanctions against the russian economy .     in their conclusions , the ministers said they would only ask the 28-nation bloc ' s executive arm to prepare for more forceful economic sanctions - including targeting the arms , energy and financial sectors .     16.38 it was revealed

drawn up by eu ambassadors by thursday at the latest .     16.30 ap report that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said : \" russia has not done enough to contribute to a de-escalation of

actions in ukraine. , ap reports .     he says the ministers also asked the 28-nation bloc ' s executive arm to prepare for more forceful economic sanctions - including targeting the arms , energy and financial sectors - if russia fails to back down from destabilising ukraine .     timmerman did not specify how many officials were targeted under the latest sanctions , nor did he reveal their names .     european foreign ministers stopped short , at least for now , of more forceful sanctions that would hit full sectors of the russian economy .     16.03 it was revealed by the press office of the european council the foreign ministers approved a decision to send a police mission to ukraine as part of the eu ' s common security and defense policy , martin banks in brussels reports .     one

transport minister , liow tiong lai has issued a statement in response to the arrival of bodies at kharkiv .     we are relieved that the train has safely arrived at kharkiv about 11am local time . this is an important milestone in relation to the mh17 tragedy .     malaysia sent 18 dvi personnel to kharkiv to assist in the tagging and transfer of bodies to the plane , i have been briefed that the forensics team and relevant support teams will now have to undergo a process that will take a few hours prior to the remains being flown off to amsterdam .     we still need to get to the truth of what has happened and we hope for the investigators to commence their work at the crash site to determine this .     families are suffering across the world and once the remains are with the respective families , i am sure they will demand for justice to be served on those who have caused this horrific crime .     15.00 diplomats have told reuters possible new eu sanctions could include measures in the defence sector , energy technology and dual-use goods .     the news comes as ukraine ' s parliament approved a presidential decree to call up more military reserves and men under 50 to fight rebels in eastern ukraine and defend the border against a concentration of troops in russia .     \" russia continues its policy of escalating its armed confrontation , \" ukraine ' s top security official , andriy parubiy , told parliament before 232 deputies in the 450-seat parliament voted in favour of the decree .     14.50 a top security aide to putin accused the ukrainian authorities of being henchman who were taking orders from the west , acccording to reuters .     \" the west ' s henchman came to power ( in february ) and have now , in my opinion , lost some of their sovereignty , independence in decision-making and are acting under orders , \" nikolai patrushev told putin .     14.44 reuters reports malaysian prime minister najib razak , working through intermediaries to reach rebel leader alexander borodai , was a key figure in brokering the deal to get the black boxes , according to two sources in malaysia with direct knowledge of the negotiations .     the talks were kept under tight wraps , with mr razak initiating the conversation and bringing only a handful of his closest confidants into the discussions .     \" it was the prime minister ' s project , \" one of the sources said .     \" he was the main player and he kept this within a very , very , very tight circle . even some of his closest advisers were not part of this circle , and were surprised by this deal . \"     14.35 tributes continue to be paid to the victims of mh17 at amsterdam ' s schiphol airport as the thick carpet of flowers keeps on growing , harriet alexander reports .     a little boy has just turned up with his mother - wearing an oversized pilot ' s hat , which dwarfed his small head . they stood and looked at the piles of sunflowers , roses and cuddly toys , hugging each other silently .     a team of airport workers have also just been to visit and lay flowers .     many people simply stand by the railings in tears , reading the tributes .     14.23 meanwhile abc news reports michael bociurkiw , a spokesman for the organization for security and cooperation in europe told its reporters that the wreckage from the plane had been \" significantly altered \" .     according to mr bociurkiw , major pieces of the front of the plane appear to have been cut away .     the investigators also observed an individual cutting into the wreckage using power tools , abc news reported .     14.18 european union governments will discuss a specific list of possible new targets for russia sanctions on thursday , but will make no decisions at tuesday ' s meeting of eu foreign ministers , diplomats told reuters .     eu foreign ministers met in brussels today to discuss their response to the downing of the flight , and any new sanctions to be imposed against moscow over the crisis in the former soviet republic .     \" there will be no names for the sanction list today , \" one eu diplomat said . \" the european commission will propose new names for ( discussion ) on thursday . \"     14.15 meanwhile in france , harriet alexander says the website of franceinfo television analyses how sanctions could be implemented - and what impact they would have on france .     president francois hollande has said that the first of two mistral warships ordered by russia would be delivered - because the contract was signed in 2011 , the ship is almost ready to be delivered , and if france reneges on the contract they will have to reimburse russia to the tune of over a billion euros . but on the second warship , mr hollande is less emphatic .     \" that will depend on the attitude of russia , \" he said on monday evening . \" i have stated that very clearly . but at the moment , no sanctions have been decided which would force us to renounce the deal . \"     a french government source told the website that sanctions which would prevent the delivery of the warship were not currently on the table . \" france for now wants the sanctions to be financial , targeted and rapid , \" said a source close to mr hollande .     14.12 dmitri rogozine , the russian deputy prime minister , has spoken of his doubts about whether france will have to do a u-turn on selling warships to the country , harriet alexander reports .     the deputy prime minister has said he doubts france will be pressured into reneging on the deal to sell warships to russia .     \" we ' re talking about billions of euros , \" he said .     \" france is very practical and i doubt that the delivery will be cancelled . \" and he added : \" the cancellation of the order would be a lot less damaging to russia than it would be to france . \"     13.46 afp reports the ukraine interior ministry has said its forces have gained control over the strategically important town of severodonetsk from pro-russian rebels in eastern ukraine .     ukraine ' s security forces were in control of \" all the vital facilities \" in the city of around 110,000 , located roughly 120 kilometres ( 75 miles ) to the north of the key rebel stronghold of donetsk , the ministry said in a statement .     13.43 putin has vowed to do everything possible to influence pro-russian separatists in eastern ukraine and help ensure a full investigation into the crash , according to ap and russian agencies . he told a meeting of russia ' s national security council :     russia will do everything in its power for a full , comprehensive , deep , and transparent investigation . we are asked to exert influence on the militants of the south-east ( of ukraine ) . of course we will do everything in our power . \"     13.20 the dutch prime minister has been giving details of the next stage in the journey of the 298 bodies to their final resting place . harriet alexander reports :     mark rutte said that the bodies , travelling in a refrigerated train from donetsk , had arrived in kharkiv - where dutch air force planes were waiting .     the hercules c-130 planes would , early tomorrow morning , begin flying the bodies back to eindhoven in the netherlands . the operation would be done in phases , he said .     and from there they would be taken to the military base at hilversum , near amsterdam .     but he warned not to expect immediate release of the bodies to the families .     \" identification of bodies can sometimes happen fast , but might in some cases take weeks or months , \" he said .     12.42 hillary clinton last night called for the us and europe to work together to develop tougher sanctions against russia . ap reports :     clinton said in a facebook chat from the company ' s headquarters in menlo park , california , that tougher sanctions would make clear to russian president vladimir putin \" that there is a price to pay for this kind of behavior . \" the former secretary of state said she agreed with obama ' s comments earlier monday urging \" immediate and full access \" for investigators combing through the wreckage of the downed plane .     \" we should do more to ensure a thorough investigation that not only respects those who were murdered in the attack on the plane , but also tries to find answers to who is responsible , \" clinton wrote during the question-and-answer session on the popular social media site .     12.32 mark rutte , the dutch prime minister , has not shown the same resolve to slap sanctions on russia as david cameron has , reports harriet alexander .     while rutte has been outspoken about the treatment of the bodies and the urgency for them to be returned to their families , he has only suggested further retaliation if putin blocks repatriation .     yesterday he said in parliament that their priority was returning the bodies - skirting the sanction issue somewhat .     but the nrc newspaper here puts it more bluntly . their front page today shows putin and rutte with the headline : \" time for a break ? \"     de telegraaf , a leading newspaper in the netherlands , shows king willem-alexander and queen maxima , with the headline : \" we ' re not letting go of each other . \"     below the fold of the page , their reporter writes of \" tensions over the release of the bodies \" and tells of \" goosebumps on seeing the crash site . \"     12.26 tony abbott , australia \u2019 s prime minister , has called for a multinational force to be deployed to the mh17 crash site in ukraine to put an end to an attempted cover-up and \u201cevidence tampering on an industrial scale \u201d . jonathan pearlman reports     tony abbott , australia \u2019 s prime minister , has called for a multinational force to be deployed to the mh17 crash site in ukraine to put an end to an attempted cover-up and \u201cevidence tampering on an industrial scale \u201d .     condemning the disturbing scenes emerging from the debris field , mr abbott said the countries worst affected by the attack should have an opportunity to send troops to ensure the remains of victims and all evidence were recovered without interference .     australia lost 37 citizens and residents on the flight , which was carrying 298 passengers from amsterdam to kuala lumpur ; the netherlands and malaysia were the worst-affected nations .     \u201cafter the crime , comes the cover-up , \u201d mr abbott said .     \u201cwhat we have seen is evidence tampering on an industrial scale and obviously that has to stop . a multinational police force , or a multinational force of some kind , is not something that can be just summonsed up in a matter of a few hours , but obviously there does need to be security at this site. \u201d     12.14 the first bodies of mh17 victims will not arrive in the netherlands until wednesday , the country ' s prime minister has announced .     \" tomorrow the first plane [ with bodies ] will leave for eindhoven , \" in the southern netherlands , mark rutte told journalists after the bodies arrived in ukraine ' s kharkiv from rebel-held territory .     12.10 with the tacit approval of malaysia ' s leaders , hundreds of protestors have gathered outside the russian embassy in kuala lumpur to demand justice and action from moscow . tom phillips reports from malaysia :     demonstrators descended on the tree-lined russian embassy in kuala lumpur on tuesday afternoon carrying banners that read : \u201ccan we trust russia to tell the truth ? \u201d , \u201cpresident putin , we demand justice \u201d and \u201cgenocide at 33,000ft \u201d .     \u201cwe don \u2019 t want any more cover up about this matter . the whole nation wants to know the real

today , \u201d said mohamad kassim ali , a 50 year-old , who was one of perhaps 300 protesters outside the embassy compound .     the organisers , members of the youth wing of unmo , malaysia \u2019 s ruling party , insisted their demonstration was not political .     yet having received tacit support from malaysia \u2019 s leaders the protest was precisely that . black-clad demonstrators came on specially chartered coaches to send moscow the message that malaysia \u2019 s politicians have so far felt unable to publicly deliver themselves .     \u201cmr putin should do more than just talk , \u201d said ibdilillah ishak , a 38-year-old youth wing organiser . \u201cit has taken them four days to actually do something . are they hiding the truth ? what is going on ? why are they hiding the truth ? \u201d     \u201cto me , this is a genocide of 298 people at 33,000 feet , \u201d mr ishak added . \u201cwho will fight for them , if not the malaysians right now ? \u201d     11.51 the eu is compromimsing its values in order to protect its trade ties with russia , lithuania ' s president has suggested , as eu foreign ministers meet in brussels to decide whether to strengthen sanctions against moscow over the mh17 disaster .     \" we see the mistralisation of european policy , \" dalia grybauskaite said earlier today , referring to a 1.2 billion euro ( $ 1.6 billion ) deal to supply russia with two french mistral warships .     values and security are undermined for the sake of business , when ' buy and rule ' is being applied ...     the sale of military technology to russia the under current circumstances cannot be tolerated ...     nazism was not stopped in the 1930s , and we now we see great-russia chauvinism which leads to things like an attack against a civilian airliner     those who organised , ordered and supplied weapons must be held responsible , before the hague tribunal         dalia grybauskaite , lithuania \u2019 s president ( getty )     11.33 colin brazier , the sky news journalist who came under fire for picking up mh17 victims ' luggage live on air , has apologised for his \" error of judgement .     writing in the guardian , mr brazier said :     at the weekend i got things wrong . if there was someone to apologise to in person , i would . while presenting sky ' s lunchtime coverage of the flight mh17 disaster , i stooped down to look at a piece of debris . it was a child ' s suitcase . i put my hand inside and lifted up a water bottle and a set of keys . as i did so my mental circuit-breaker finally engaged and i apologised instantly on-air for what i was doing .     out of the corner of my eye i spotted a pink drinking flask . it looked familiar . my six-year-old daughter , kitty , has one just like it ...     too late , i realised that i was crossing a line .     11.13 david cameron is a hypocrite who should \" start by cleaning up his own backyard \" before lecturing france on selling military equipment to russia , the head of francois hollande ' s ruling socialist party has said .     jean-christophe cambadelis , told i>tele television on tuesday :     hollande is not backing down . he is delivering the first ( ship ) despite the fact he is being asked not to .     this is a false debate led by hypocrites ... when you see how many ( russian ) oligarchs have sought refuge in london , david cameron should start by cleaning up his own backyard .         catherine ashton talks with philip hammond in brussels ( thierry charlier/afp/getty )     11.00 philip hammond , the new british foreign secretary , has arrived in brussels for the meeting of eu foreign ministers to discuss a collective response to the ukraine crisis , as well as gaza . he said :     this terrible incident happened in the first place because of russia ' s support to the separatists in eastern ukraine , because of the flow of heavy weapons from russia into eastern ukraine , and we have to address that issue .     the world has changed since the european council last week .     the events of last thursday have changed public expectations on us and we have to send a clear signal from our meeting today that we recognise that and that we are going to go further as a consequence of what has happened .         one of the two black boxes recovered from the crash site of the mh17 jet during a press conference in donetsk ( damien simonart/afp/getty )     10.36 harriet alexander is in amsterdam , where victims ' families and friends are mourning their loved ones :     there has been a steady stream of people coming to leave flowers outside schiphol airport this morning .     this bouquet has been left with the headline from yesterday ' s de telegraaf - a newspaper here in the netherlands . it reads : \" give us our people back \" .     some 193 of the 298 victims of the disaster were from holland .     the dutch government has yet to announce which airport the bodies will be transferred to later on today . schipol airport , in amsterdam , was the point of origin of mh17 ' s final journey .     10.28 roland oliphant reports from donetsk for the telegraph on the \" official \" handover of the mh17 black boxes to malaysian officials , which delayed the movement of victims ' corpses from the city up to kharkiv :     the train carrying both the bodies of the victims and the \u201cblack box \u201d flight recorders has arrived in the ukrainian city of kharkiv .     the departure was delayed by last-minute wrangling over the handover of the black boxes , which had originally been scheduled for 9.00pm local time last night ( 7.00pm uk time ) .     after several hours of closed-door negotiations , rebel prime minister alexander borodai finally emerged to hand over the flight recorders to malaysian officials at 1.00am ...     it emerged during the handover ceremony that 282 bodies and 87 body parts were on the train . that leaves 16 casualties as yet unaccounted for .     it is not clear what held up the transfer , which appears to have followed intense international diplomacy on friday .     but the rebels appear to have gone to great lengths to make the hand over as \u201cofficial \u201d as possible , summoning the international press to the headquarters of the self-declared donetsk people \u2019 s republic to witness rebel and malaysian officials signing protocols to confirm the transaction .     the documents are of great symbolic value to the rebels because they represent the first international agreement the unrecognised \u201crepublic \u201d has ever signed - making it the nearest the breakaway state has ever come to official recognition .     10.18 eu foreign ministers have arrived in brussels for a meeting in which tougher , sector-level sanctions against russia over mh17 are expected to be top of the agenda .     on arrival , germany ' s foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier called for tougher sanctions against the kremlin .     germany has traditionally been seen as softer on russia than many of its eu allies due to close energy import and manufacturing export links , but angela merkel is believed to have run out of patience with vladimir putin in recent days .     10.05 photographs have emerged appearing to show the arrival of the refrigerated train carriages containing 282 mh17 victims ' bodies at kharkiv .     the

thursday . the telegraph ' s harriet alexander reports :     outside schiphol airport in amsterdam , a huge carpet of flowers has been laid in memory of the 298 victims .     candles flickered among the countless bunches of roses , lilies and sunflowers - a tribute all the more poignant given that the plane crashed in a field of ukrainian sunflowers .     and as a gesture to the 80 children who lost their lives , many stuffed toys and cartoon cards were among the flowers .     a queue of people lined up silently to sign a book of condolences .     one woman , a klm air stewardess , had tears

sanctions against moscow following the downing of flight mh17 .     as eu foreign ministers , including philip hammond , the foreign secretary , meet in brussels later today to discuss toughening sanctions , the french refusal to halt the contract to supply two helicopter carriers to the russian navy has come under particular fire .     the fact that france is still providing training to russian service personnel was the subject of heated contacts between us and european officials last the weekend , officials said , as months of tension over the project came to a head .     \" the americans are absolutely furious about the french still training the russians , \" a western diplomatic source told the telegraph in washington . \" the question everyone is asking is , ' at what

of scams seeking to take advantage of the malaysia airlines mh17 tragedy , saying false facebook profiles had already been set up .     in an attempt to make money from the tragedy of the jet which was apparently shot down over ukraine , killing all 298 on board , fake social media profiles of some australian victims had been created , the australian competition and consumer commission said .

granite sarcophagus in alexandria , untouched for 2,000 years - and fleet-footed rumour quickly got to work .     could it contain the remains of ancient greek leader alexander the great , or ( less appealingly ) a deadly curse ?     according to experts who have now unsealed it , it ' s a no to both .     instead , it revealed three skeletons and red-brown sewage water , which gave off an unbearable stench .     egypt ' s ministry of antiquities had appointed a committee of archaeologists to open the relic , which was unearthed at a construction site .     according to egyptian news outlet el-watan , they initially lifted the lid of the tomb by just 5cm ( 2 inches ) before the pungent smell forced them from the inspection scene entirely . they later prised it open with help from egyptian military engineers .     \" we found the bones of three people , in what looks like a family burial ... unfortunately the mummies inside were not in the best condition and only the bones remain , \" said mostafa waziri , secretary-general of the supreme council of antiquities .     image copyright afp/getty images image caption the tomb was found to contain three skeletons , believed

the infamous \" mummy ' s curse \" , but are there other threats in ancient tombs ?     lord carnarvon , financial backer of the excavation of tutankhamun ' s burial site , died from an infected mosquito bite shortly after they opened the chamber in 1923.     since then , rumours have swirled that mould or bacteria survived in the sealed area and caused or contributed to his fate .     but f dewolfe miller , professor of epidemiology at the university of hawaii , told national geographic that there ' s no real danger .     \" we don ' t know of even a single case of either an archaeologist or a tourist experiencing any negative consequences [ from bacteria or tomb moulds ] , \" he told the magazine .     experts have said the three individuals in the alexandria sarcophagus may have been soldiers in the time of the pharaohs .     the skull of one is said to show cracks which point to an arrow injury .     an alabaster bust , its features weathered beyond recognition ,
