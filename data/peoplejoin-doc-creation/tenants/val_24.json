#vaccinateus \" .     another that argued for vaccinations said : \" #vaccinateus you can ' t fix stupidity . let them die from measles , and i ' m for #vaccination ! \"     meanwhile less sophisticated \" content polluters \" - bot accounts that distribute malware , unsolicited commercial content and disruptive materials - shared anti-vaccination messages much more frequently than average twitter users , using them as \" bait \" to get people to click on links to malicious websites .     social media companies are struggling to find ways to combat disinformation on their platforms .     earlier this week facebook and twitter said they had suspended or removed accounts linked to iran and russia over \" inauthentic \" or \" manipulating \" behaviour .     in july twitter was reported to have shut down up to 70m fake and suspicious accounts .     health cost of vaccination ' debate '     despite science overwhelmingly and indisputably advocating in favour of immunisation , a growing number of parents around the world are resisting medical advice by going their own way .     some base their decision on discredited research 20 years ago that erroneously linked the measles , mumps and rubella vaccine ( mmr ) to autism .     but health officials say the number of people getting the disease measles is rising because of a fall in vaccinations .     in europe more than 41,000 people were infected with measles in the first six months of 2018 - nearly double the number of cases for the whole of last year - leading to 37 deaths .     high rates of measles were seen in serbia , ukraine , georgia and greece .     in the us the number of children being exempted from vaccines is also rising .     in italy , the upper house of parliament has voted through legislation to abolish the law that makes vaccination mandatory for children before they start school . the amendment will mean parents of unvaccinated children will no longer face fines .\n"}], "farshid": [{"url": "file://val/24/1/0", "title": "val/24/1/0", "content": "french police officers patrol in the streets front of flowers to pay respects of the victims following an attack killing three persons and wounding at least 13 , in strasbourg , eastern france , thursday , ...
