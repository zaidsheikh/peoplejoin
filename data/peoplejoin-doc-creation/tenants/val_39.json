safety feature that increases the vehicle ' s stability during atmospheric re-entry . akin to the flight of a shuttlecock in badminton , the feather system allows spaceshiptwo to rely on aerodynamics

ultimately able to carry out a nominal landing .     \" scaled is looking at the data now , but doesn ' t anticipate any major issues , \" whitesides said . \" this is why we flight test , to fully
