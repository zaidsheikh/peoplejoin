saying she had information . wagoner county investigators interviewed her at the police department and subsequently arrested her on complaints of three counts of first-degree murder and three counts of first-degree burglary .     investigators haven ' t released the names of anyone involved but say the deceased suspects are between 16 and 18 years old . one of the suspects had a knife and another had brass knuckles , according to investigators .         deputies responded to the home near 9100 s. clearview drive around 12 : 30 p.m. after a report of a possible home invasion with shots fired . upon arrival , deputies found three suspects dead and the two residents uninjured .     deputy nick mahoney says the preliminary investigation shows that the three suspects went to the residence with the intent to burglarize the home .     \" they were dressed in black , all had masks on , and all had gloves on , \" said mahoney .     mahoney says the suspects broke in through a glass door in the back of the house . after entering the residence , the suspects encountered the homeowner ' s 23-year-old son , who also lives there . the resident was carrying an ar-15 .         \" there was a short
