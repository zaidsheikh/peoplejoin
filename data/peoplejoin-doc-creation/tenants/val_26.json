untrue that i was such an important personage that i could oversee or would independently oversee the persecution of the jews . \" eichmann argued that the judges ignored his claim that he \" never served in such a high-ranking position that would have involved such decisive and independent authorities . \"             the war criminal , who was among those most involved in carrying out the holocaust , further wrote : \" i also never gave any orders in my name , but always operated according to orders . had i been , as the judges assume , the fanatical driving force in the persecution of the jews , this should have been reflected in a promotion and other rewards , but i was never granted any benefit . a line must be drawn between the leaders who are responsible and people like me ,

( parking lots seem to be rich sources of history in the u.k. \u2014 richard iii ' s skeleton was found underneath a parking lot , as was a medieval knight in scotland. )     the team dug a small trench across the mound and used radioactive carbon isotopes , or atoms of carbon with different molecular weights , to date the charcoal found in the soil .
