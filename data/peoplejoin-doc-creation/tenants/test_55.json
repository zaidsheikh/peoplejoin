miffed he didn \u2019 t often seek his advice until after the democrats \u2019 losses in the 2010 midterm elections .     brinkley said tension between past and present presidents isn \u2019 t unusual . hillary clinton \u2019 s role as secretary of state in the obama administration has added a level of complexity to the relationship .     \u201cit sort of forces camaraderie between obama and clinton , \u201d he said . \u201cthey are not intimate or close or personal friends , but they are sort of forced to tolerate each other. \u201d     boom times     the threat of losing the white house has united the two leaders , the most popular figures in their party in recent history . still , clinton \u2019 s prominent role in obama \u2019 s re-election convention could remind voters of the booming economic times during the former president \u2019 s tenure in the 1990s .     matthew dowd , a bloomberg analyst and political consultant , told those gathered yesterday at a bloomberg-sponsored panel discussion near the convention site in charlotte , north carolina , that obama \u2019 s campaign needs to be careful about contrasting clinton and obama too much .     there \u2019 s a chance undecided voters could say to themselves , \u201cbarack obama is not like that kind of president . he \u2019 s never going to be like that kind of president and maybe i \u2019 m going to try a new guy , \u201d said dowd , a former strategist for president george w. bush .     \u201cthey have to be really careful with bill clinton , \u201d he said . \u201ci think they can overdo this. \u201d     an obama campaign spokeswoman yesterday played down the risk that voters would compare obama to the more prosperous days of the clinton administration , when the national unemployment rate dropped from above 7 percent to below 4 percent .     \u2018deeply involved \u2019     \u201che is somebody who can speak directly from experience , not only from his time as president in the \u2019 90s , but also as somebody who \u2019 s been deeply involved in the last decade post- presidency about what we need to do to move this country forward , \u201d re-election spokeswoman jen psaki told reporters traveling with obama in virginia .     counter to typical protocol of vetting speeches well in advance of their convention delivery , obama \u2019 s campaign hadn \u2019 t yet seen the text of clinton \u2019 s speech as of early yesterday .     \u201cbut we have had lots of conversations with president clinton and his team , \u201d jim messina , obama \u2019 s campaign manager said at a separate bloomberg news breakfast in charlotte . \u201che \u2019 s going to give a great speech tomorrow night. \u201d     stephanie cutter , the deputy campaign manager , said at the same event that \u201csomeone in our organization is likely to see the speech before the president gives it , just because that \u2019 s normal course of business. \u201d     courting independents     republican presidential nominee mitt romney has himself tried to draw bill clinton into the campaign . the former massachusetts governor has spoken favorably about the former president \u2019 s white house tenure in an effort to appeal to independent voters and show he doesn \u2019 t disparage all democrats .     \u201cpresident obama tucked away the clinton doctrine in his large drawer of discarded ideas , along with transparency and bipartisanship , \u201d romney said in des moines on may 15 . \u201cit \u2019 s enough to make you wonder if maybe it was a personal beef with the clintons , but probably it runs much deeper than that. \u201d     as is the case with many presidents , clinton \u2019 s popularity has grown since he left office . two-thirds of americans have a favorable opinion of him , according to a gallup poll in july .     clinton could help obama , 51 , win over \u201cwhite middle-class voters \u201d in battleground states like ohio ,

the economy and with voters , it \u2019 s hard to imagine a better endorsement barack obama could get. \u201d     clinton \u2019 s speech is just part of a multi-faceted campaign effort on obama \u2019 s behalf . he \u2019 s been drafted to serve as a prime surrogate for campaign events , pitched obama \u2019 s economic policy , raised money , endorsed the president \u2019 s rescue of the u.s. auto industry and highlighted his killing of al-qaeda leader osama bin laden .     like virtually any high-profile personality , clinton can go off-message , too . during a may 31 cnn interview , he undercut the narrative obama \u2019 s campaign has tried to build around romney being interested only in profits when he was a private-equity executive , saying that a \u201cman who has been governor and had a sterling business career crosses the qualification threshold. \u201d     \u2018more relevant \u2019     in a subsequent interview with pbs , clinton said it \u2019 s \u201cmuch more relevant \u201d to look at what romney did as governor and what he says he \u2019 d do as president .     in one of obama \u2019 s campaign ads , clinton frames the election as a \u201cclear choice \u201d between a republican plan to cut taxes for upper-income earners and the president \u2019 s proposals to strengthen the middle class by spending more on education and job training .     \u201cwe need to keep going with his plan , \u201d clinton says in the ad , which ran 2,299 times from aug. 24 to aug. 27 , according to new york-based kantar media \u2019 s cmag , which tracks advertising . another obama campaign ad cites clinton in its response to a romney spot that says obama wants to remove work requirements from welfare .     people knowledgeable about the relationship say that while the two are in a good place , it isn \u2019 t one described as overly warm . obama and clinton are respectful and friendly , without being effusive .     to contact the reporter on this story : john

message     sept. 1 , 2015     for immediate release         bloomington , ind . -- in her hit single , carly rae jepsen may have sung , \" here ' s my number , so call me maybe . \" but according to a new research study from indiana university , she might be more successful in finding love if she asked him to send her an email .     the research , which has been accepted for publication in the journal computers in human behavior , suggests that , in this digital age , an email can be more effective in expressing romantic feelings than leaving a voicemail message .     previous research and conventional wisdom suggested the opposite , that a voicemail message is a more intimate way to connect with others , but that may not be true , particularly among millennials .     \u201cthe bottom line is that email is much better when you want to convey some information that you want someone to think about , \u201d said one of the authors , alan r. dennis , the john t. chambers chair of internet systems in iu \u2019 s kelley school of business .     dennis and co-author taylor m. wells , an assistant professor of management information systems at california state university-sacramento , set out to learn more about how we respond emotionally to these newer forms of communication .     although voicemail , email and texting are part of everyday life , very little is known about how their characteristics influence and distort communication in work and personal settings .     using psychophysiological measures from 72 college-age people , dennis and wells found that people who sent romantic emails were more emotionally aroused and used stronger and more thoughtful language than those who left voicemails .     \u201cwhen writing romantic emails , senders consciously or subconsciously added more positive content to their messages , perhaps to compensate for the medium \u2019 s inability to convey vocal tone , \u201d dennis and wells wrote in the paper , \u201cto email or not to email : the impact of media on psychophysiological responses and emotional content in utilitarian and romantic communication. \u201d     \u201cemail enables senders to modify the content as messages are composed to ensure they are crafted to the needs of the situation . voicemail lacks this feature , \u201d they added . \u201ca sender records a voicemail in a single take , and it can be sent or discarded and re-recorded , but not edited . thus senders engage with email messages longer and may think about the task more deeply than when leaving voicemails . this extra processing may increase arousal. \u201d     previous research suggests that email and text chat are considered poor for communicating emotion . this is believed to be the first research study on how we respond to email using physiological measures .     dennis and wells \u2019 findings weren \u2019 t just about pulling heartstrings -- the use of email induced more arousing psychophysiological responses than voicemail , regardless of whether the message was utilitarian or romantic . gender was not found to be a factor and was omitted in the final analysis .     in an interview , dennis noted that their findings run counter to media naturalness theory , a commonly held evolutionary standard suggesting that the further we get away from face-to-face communications , the less natural and less effective it becomes .     \u201cin this case , we found people adapted , \u201d dennis said . \u201cemail \u2019 s been in the popular consciousness since the 1990s , and if you look at the new generation of millenials , and that \u2019 s who we studied , they \u2019 ve grown up with email and text messaging . so it may not be as unnatural a medium as we at first thought .     \u201cthere \u2019 s a lot of theory that says email and other text communications don \u2019 t really work very well , \u201d dennis added . \u201cwe should probably go back and reconsider a lot of the stereotypical assumptions that we hold about email and text messaging that may not hold true when we take a deeper look at how people react physiologically. \u201d     the researchers did not see much use of emoticons and emojis in their emails . rather , they found that when writing emails , subjects took more time to choose their words carefully to make sure the language conveyed the full meaning .     the study also demonstrated that the medium used can shape the content of the message . senders of utilitarian messages sent less positive emails than voicemails for the same communication task . however , when composing romantic messages , senders included the most positive and most arousing emotional content in emails and the least positive and least arousing emotional content in voicemails .     \u201cwe expected that using email for romantic communication would be more frustrating than using voicemail , but our data do not show this , \u201d the authors wrote . \u201cthere was neither greater emotional arousal nor greater negative emotional valence when using email for romantic tasks versus utilitarian tasks .     \u201cthese results taken together suggest that \u2018the medium is the message \u2019 ( as famously coined by philosopher marshall mcluhan in 1964 ) in a more fundamental way than we have previously understood , \u201d they added . \u201cour results show that the medium changes how message senders feel and what they say. \u201d     dennis warns managers against misinterpreting these findings to suggest that face-to-face meetings , personal phone calls and other direct forms of communications aren \u2019 t as useful .     \u201cif something isn \u2019 t really clear and you want to make sure that everyone has the same understanding of what something means , that \u2019 s best done in phone calls , face-to-face meetings or video conferencing , \u201d dennis said . \u201cyou have different cues , and it \u2019 s also synchronous discussion , as opposed to email , where time goes by before the receiver gets to it. \u201d     the research was conducted by placing skin sensors on the subjects \u2019 faces to measure muscle movement associated with positive and negative emotion , and on their feet to measure arousal . subjects were randomly chosen to do voicemail or email first and produce a utilitarian or a romantic message first .     wells conducted the research with dennis while he was a doctoral candidate at the kelley school .     related links\n"}], "eden": [{"url": "file://test/55/0/0", "title":

every democrat ' s mind : will hillary rodham clinton run for president in 2016 ? the former president speaks last , probably starting after 10 : 30 p.m. et     2 ) elizabeth warren is ready for her close-up : warren , a harvard law professor and long-time consumer advocate , is the democratic nominee for senate in massachusetts . it ' s one of the nation ' s hottest senate races , and could determine which party controls the chamber . she is challenging republican incumbent scott brown , who won the seat after the death of edward kennedy .     3 ) locking down the women ' s vote : warren is one a series of female speakers at the convention , as obama seeks to exploit his advantage over republican challenger mitt romney among female voters , using such issues as contraceptives and abortion rights . among the speakers tonight : sandra fluke , who was called a \" slut \" and \" prostitute \" by radio talk show host rush limbaugh after she testified on behalf of contraception services in health care plans .     4 ) the \" great state \" roll call : officially , the convention is about nominating obama and vice president biden to a second term and to do that , the roll call is required . obama had no major party opposition in the primary season , so guess who ' s the favorite ? but it ' s unclear how much tv viewers will see : the roll call is supposed to begin after clinton speaks .     5 ) the arrival : president obama arrives in charlotte this afternoon . will he make a \" surprise \" appearance at the convention ? perhaps on stage with bill clinton ? we don ' t know . we do know obama will address the convention on thursday night .\n"}, {"url": "file://test/55/1/1", "title": "test/55/1/1", "content": "president obama ' s campaign manager jim messina and deputy campaign manager stephanie cutter downplayed questions about bill clinton ' s speech not being vetted by the campaign at a bloomberg news breakfast this morning , calling it a \" mountain out

has he seen the speech ? no , messina acknowledged at the start . cutter added , \" someone in our organization is likely to see the speech before [ clinton ] gives it just because that ' s the normal course of business . \"     she added that everyone believes clinton will give a strong endorsement of obama ' s policies , which messina said clinton will describe as similar to his own . .     \" we are not one bit worried about what president clinton is going to say \" in his speech , she added .     still , there was no illusion about controlling the former president \u2014 asked at the outset

most important senate races in the fight for control of the democratic-led chamber , and they will undoubtedly include one state in particular : massachusetts . the state ' s republican sen. scott brown will go up against democrat and harvard law professor elizabeth warren in what polling indicates is likely to be a close race .     such a contest , so far the most expensive u.s. senate race , was not unexpected in this traditionally democratic state . brown , 52 , shocked the political establishment in 2010 with his victory in the special election to fill the late ted kennedy ' s seat . this is the year that kennedy would have been up for re-election , so brown is up again a mere two years after his first win .     those familiar with massachusetts politics , including brown himself , always expected democrats to mount an attempt to take back the seat this time around .     what to know a closer look at what ' s going on in the most closely watched senate race in the country     \" they want the kennedy seat back very badly , \" brown told abc news . \" they ' ve made that clear . but bottom line is , it ' s not the kennedy seat , it ' s not the democrats seat , it ' s still the people ' s seat . \"     what was unknown was who would jump in to challenge the freshmen senator . that candidate turned out to be warren , a professor at harvard law school and creator of the consumer financial protection bureau , a newly formed , federal department that came about under the obama administration .     with a good level of name recognition established as a result of her work with the agency , as well as her oversight of the troubled asset relief program ( more commonly known as tarp ) and a lengthy resume , warren was the democrats ' answer to the much-considered question of who could challenge the popular senator . warren , 63 , announced her candidacy in september 2011 , and the race has been fierce ever since .     the candidates share the same wedding anniversary date , and each one has proven to be a strong fundraiser . but the similarities end there . brown , who was recently promoted to colonel in the army national guard , plays up his regular-guy image ( he famously drove his pickup truck around the state when campaigning in 2010 ) and his bipartisan record . his campaign has run a series of ads featuring a slew of prominent massachusetts ' democrats , such as former boston mayor ray flynn , endorsing the republican candidate . his history of reaching across the aisle is something brown highlights himself .     \" bottom line is , i ' m the second-most bipartisan senator in the u.s. senate , \" brown said . \" i ' ve done exactly what i said i was going to do , which is to read the bills , understand them , see how they affect massachusetts , our country , our debt , our deficit and vote . \"     warren ' s campaign has also talked a lot about her humble beginnings : her father worked as a janitor in oklahoma , she received a scholarship from george washington university at age 16. but the campaign has also emphasized her history of protecting the consumer , and of fighting for the middle class .     \" i didn ' t get into this race based on some strategic vision of i could check off six boxes and somehow win the senate seat , \" she said . for me , it truly is around the urgency of the movement . i guess you could say the fight came to me . \"     the conversation in the senate race has mirrored the presidential race , with brown attacking warren for comments she made in 2011 when she said \" there is nobody in this country who got rich on his own . \" the comments mirror obama ' s \" you didn ' t build that \" remarks last month on which republicans have pounced .     brown last week launched a \" thank you for building this \" tour , as part of his campaign ' s efforts to highlight the senator ' s support for free enterprise . brown kicked off the tour friday by bringing coffee and donuts to a construction crew in framingham , mass .     \" i ' ve visited over 500 businesses , this is an extension of what i ' ve been doing since i was elected , \" brown said . \" i ' m going to go out there and thank those job creators , people who have put their hard earned sweat equity , their livelihood on the line , and my word to them is , ' thank you. ' \"     warren isn ' t backing down from her comments , however . indeed , the first-time candidate has made infrastructure a big part of her proposed policy agenda , recently launching her \" rebuild now \" tour that calls for an investment in the country ' s infrastructure .     \" american businesses can compete with anyone so long as they ' re competing on a level playing field , \" warren said . \" but when the chinese are making big investments in infrastructure , that means that their businesses will get their goods to market on state-of-the-art roads and bridges , they ' ll have state-of-the-art communications and power ... that gives their businesses a real competitive advantage over the next 25 years . \"     warren ' s unapologetic support for such government investment has helped to make her a rising star within the democratic base . her status was highlighted by the recent announcement that she would have a prominent speaking slot at the democratic national convention in charlotte , n.c. , next month . warren will be introducing bill clinton .     \" i ' m going to talk about what i ' ve talked about for years now , \" warren said when asked about her speech . \" america ' s middle class is getting hammered and washington is rigged to work for the big guy . that ' s what got me into this race , and that ' s what i will talk about . \"     whether it will win over the hearts of a majority of massachusetts voters is the bigger question , though . the race is everywhere in the state : turn on the radio , glance a newspaper , even just walk down the streets of boston and you will hear an ad , see an article , or pass by a bumper sticker for one of the two candidates . and that presence is only going to increase in the coming weeks and months .     the race is the most expensive senate race in the country so far in terms of money raised . a combined total of $ 46 million has been raised already , according to the center for responsive politics , and so massachusetts residents can expect to be blanketed with a lot more tv , radio and internet advertising as november draws closer . voters will also get a chance to see brown and warren go head-to-head soon . in the fall , the candidates will face off in a series of four televised debates .     what voters might not see , however , are ads from outside groups . brown and warren in january signed an agreement called \" the people ' s pledge , \" which vowed to keep advertisements from third-party spending groups out of the race . eight months later , the pledge is still in place . warren says she believes the plan has allowed the candidates to focus more on the issues .     \" it has at least opened the space to be able to talk about issues , \" warren said .     for months now , polling has shown the two candidates in a statistical tie , and barring any big surprises , it ' s expected to stay that way . unsurprisingly , each candidate holds a different opinion on what the race is ultimately about .     \" this is really about jobs and the economy and how we are going to get our country moving again , \" brown said . \" you ' re going to have somebody down there who has been doing his job , me , working on the issues that matter , jobs and the economy , versus somebody who ' s a rock- thrower and doesn ' t want to compromise . \"     warren said , \" i think it ' s about the kind of people we are , and the kind of people we ' re trying to be .     \" to me , it ' s about this vision , what kind of people are we and what kind of country are we trying to be ? \"\n"}]}, "user_id_to_descriptions": {"alice": "Is interested in compiling a summary.", "farshid": "Knows about the following topics:\nSan Bernardino, terrorist attack, loan, target practice, gun ranges\nDemocratic National Convention, Bill Clinton, Elizabeth Warren, Barack Obama, Charlotte\ncomputer mediated communication, email, voicemail, psychophysiological responses, message content\nAlexa Internet, Internet Archive, Wayback Machine", "bhushan": "Knows about the following topics:\nSan Bernardino, terror attack, Syed Rizwan Farook, Tashfeen Malik, shooting practice\nBill Clinton, Barack Obama, Democratic National Convention, 2012 election, Hillary Clinton\nBill Clinton, Barack Obama, 2008 election, Democratic National Convention, Hillary Clinton\nemail, voicemail, romantic communication, Carly Rae Jepsen, Indiana University", "eden": "Knows about the following topics:\nSan Bernardino, shooting, Syed Rizwan Farook, Inland Regional Center, active shooter\nDemocratic National Convention, Bill Clinton, Elizabeth Warren, women's vote, Barack Obama\nObama, Clinton, speech, campaign, endorsement\nMassachusetts Senate race, Scott Brown, Elizabeth Warren, Democratic National Convention, infrastructure investment"}, "user_id_to_table_names": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_templated": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_lowprecision": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_lowprecision_templated": {}}
