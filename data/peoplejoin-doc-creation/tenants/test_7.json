namibia , for example. \u201d     the relocation of endangered animals \u2013 known as translocation \u2013 involves putting them to sleep for the journey and then reviving them in a process that carries risks . but the loss of half of them is highly unusual .         the black rhinos were moved from the nairobi and lake nakuru national parks to a new sanctuary created in tsavo east national park in an operation announced by najib balala , the kenyan tourism minister and carried out in collaboration with wwf kenya .     in a statement the ministry said its preliminary investigations suggested the rhinos had died of salt poisoning as they tried to adapt to saltier water in their new home . it suspended the ongoing move of other rhinos and said the surviving ones were being closely monitored .     \u201cthe eight dead rhinos were among those that had been moved to the sanctuary in an initiative to start a new population in line with the national rhino conservation and management strategy , \u201d the ministry said . \u201cthis kind of mortality rate is unprecedented in kenya wildlife service operations. \u201d     \u201ca total of 14 rhinos had been planned to be translocated .     it was the first time since the 1990s that black rhinos had been moved to tsavo east , which originally had a population of nearly 2,000 , according to save the rhino , but now has between 10 and 20.         kahumbu said officials must take responsibility and explain what went wrong . \u201crhinos have died . we have to say it openly when it happens , not a week later or a month later , \u201d she said . \u201csomething must have gone wrong , and we want to know what it is. \u201d     kenya wants to increase its black rhino population to 2,000 by creating populations in areas that provide the right habitat for the animals to thrive .     dean said translocation was not as common in kenya as in other southern african countries , such as namibia .     \u201cin kenya , they do it every three to four years , whereas other countries are doing them every year , \u201d she said .     \u201cthere needs to be a postmortem and we need to look at the whole protocol for translocation. \u201d     the ministry said it had invited an external expert from south africa to join its investigation and if negligence was found to be a contributory factor disciplinary action would be taken .     \u201cwe will make the investigation results public as soon as we receive them , \u201d the statement said .     according to kws figures , nine rhinos were killed in kenya last year . in may , three more were shot dead inside a specially protected sanctuary in northern kenya and had their horns removed . in march , the last male northern white rhino on the planet , an older bull named sudan , was put down by kenyan vets after becoming ill.\n"}, {"url": "file://test/7/0/1", "title": "test/7/0/1", "content": "file- in this file photo taken on saturday , april 30 , 2005 , kenya wildlife services wardens hold a fully grown 30 year old female black rhino , after it was darted at nairobi national park . a kenyan wildlife ...

( associated press )     nairobi , kenya ( ap ) \u2014 eight critically endangered black rhinos are dead in kenya after wildlife workers moved them from the capital to a new national park , the government said friday , calling the toll \" unprecedented \" in more than a decade of such transfers .     preliminary investigations point to salt poisoning as the rhinos tried to adapt to saltier water in their new home , the ministry of tourism and wildlife said in a statement , describing how the animals likely became dehydrated and drank more salty water in a fatal cycle .     the ministry suspended the ongoing move of rhinos and said the surviving ones in the new park were being closely monitored .     the loss is \" a complete disaster , \" said prominent kenyan conservationist paula kahumbu of wildlifedirect .     conservationists in africa have been working hard to protect the black rhino sub-species from poachers targeting them for their horns to supply an illegal asian market .     in moving a group of 11 rhinos to the newly created tsavo east national park from nairobi last month , the kenya wildlife service said it hoped to boost the population there . the government agency has not said how the rhinos died . fourteen of the animals were to be moved in all .     \" disciplinary action will definitely be taken \" if an investigation into the deaths indicates negligence by agency staff , the wildlife ministry said .     \" moving rhinos is complicated , akin to moving gold bullion , it requires extremely careful planning and security due to the value of these rare animals , \" kahumbu said in a statement . \" rhino translocations also have major welfare considerations and i dread to think of the suffering that these poor animals endured before they died . \"     transporting wildlife is a strategy used by conservationists to help build up , or even bring back , animal populations . in may , six black rhinos were moved from south africa to chad , restoring the species to the country in north-central africa nearly half a century after it was wiped out there .     kenya transported 149 rhinos between 2005 and 2017 with eight deaths , the wildlife ministry said .     according to wwf , black rhino populations declined dramatically in the 20th century , mostly at the hands of european hunters and settlers . between 1960 and 1995 numbers dropped by 98 percent , to fewer than 2,500.     since then the species has rebounded , although it remains extremely threatened . in addition to poaching the animals also face habitat loss .     african parks , a johannesburg-based conservation group , said earlier this year that there are fewer than 25,000 rhinos in the african wild , of which about 20 percent are black rhinos and the rest white rhinos .     in another major setback for conservation , the last remaining male northern white rhino on the planet died in march in kenya , leaving conservationists struggling to save that sub-species using in vitro fertilization .     ___     follow africa news at https://twitter.com/ap_africa\n"}, {"url": "file://test/7/1/0", "title": "test/7/1/0", "content": "image copyright ap image

in prospecting in downtown oroville . dan reidel \u2014 enterprise-record     oroville >> now is not the time to quit your day job in hopes of striking it rich . however , people with a new or renewed interest in gold mining may be spending more of their summer weekends near rivers and streams .     joey wilson owns adventures in prospecting in oroville , where he says there \u2019 s been more excitement among his gold mining customers .     \u201cthere \u2019 s always been gold in the feather river , \u201d he said . what \u2019 s new is that the recent floods have moved things around .     it \u2019 s not just the feather river . floods scoured the banks of the american river , the mokelumne , the yuba and just about any other waterway where 49ers once got their boots dirty .     curtis barwick was in oroville saturday waiting for the prospecting store to open . he usually looks for gold closer to his home in anderson , but decided to check out oroville on his day off . he said gold mining gets him outdoors and helps him \u201crecharge , \u201d after a stressful week at work . it \u2019 s a lot like hiking , another of his hobbies , but with gold mining there \u2019 s a chance of a reward .     \u201cthe odds are greater than winning the lottery , \u201d he said . even on days when he only finds a few flakes , it \u2019 s fun to turn over rocks and sand .     he \u2019 s not alone . in fact , he \u2019 s a member of the shasta miners and prospectors association .     back in the day , miners in the 1850s did not have metal detectors . barwick bought one a while back and said if \u201clead was gold , i \u2019 d be rich. \u201d he had found more bullet casings than he cares to collect . other finds include coins , and a 1944 nickel . he gave his girlfriend a ring he found in the dirt , and would recommend that anyone who buys a metal detector have some fun digging around in their own backyard .     others make gold mining an adventure . that \u2019 s one of the reasons wilson named his shop \u201cadventures in prospecting. \u201d he sells wet suits and fins , and personally loves to dive when he hunts gold .     finding gold is a common thread for cindy and paul pekarek , who were at the montgomery street miner \u2019 s supply shop saturday . the couple belong to the mother lode goldhounds , near grass valley , and for fun they travel to new digs , including oroville .     paul pekarek is a five-time gold mining champion , he said pointing to a pin on his wide-brimmed , black leather hat . the pin includes a miniature gold pan , pickaxe and shovel , with a real glob of gold in the center . to win the championships , he proved he could pan faster than most others .     advertisement     some people , like mark saposnik , are \u201cpretty serious \u201d about gold mining . saposnik spent his summers during college dredge mining . it \u2019 s more difficult to find gold now that dredging is no longer allowed , he said . the recent floods have \u201crearranged the rivers , \u201d he said , and he \u2019 ll spend more time stomping around .     spillway gold ?     gold miners can speculate all they want about gold that may or may not have washed down the hillside near the oroville spillway . before hydraulic mining was outlawed , hillsides up and down the river were washed away to unearth gold .     gold is heavy , and prospectors would love to discover what is among the debris at the diversion pool . however , the area is closed except for the work crew .     recent word from department of water resources acting director bill croyle was that he did not know if gold had been found in the area .     it \u2019 s a moot point because \u201cif anybody gets close to it they will be run off , \u201d said bob van camp , known locally as \u201cdigger bob. \u201d     van camp was the spokesman in 2014 when a 5.18 pound gold nugget was found in the butte foothills . the man who found the nugget has remained anonymous , but van camp was allowed to tell the story .     as for the spillway debris , van camp said he believes there is a gold vein that runs from potter \u2019 s ravine and south , including the area of the spillway .     in addition to panning near waterways , prospectors look for quartz , especially chunks that have been worn smooth by water flow . \u201cthen you go downstream. \u201d     he \u2019 ll also walk the higher ground with a metal detector , hoping some of that quartz will give him a strong signal .     ninety-nine percent of the time the quartz is just quartz , but \u201cnow and again , \u201d the quartz will have \u201csome sort of metal in it. \u201d this might mean manganese or silver , \u201cor there may be gold inside. \u201d     part of the fun in finding gold is knowing it \u2019 s something that an old-time gold miner missed , van camp said . \u201ci don \u2019 t do it for the money . i just do it for the adventure , for the challenge. \u201d     he would love to get his hands dirty in the diversion pool at lake oroville right now . however , he understands that dwr is working night and day to get the water flow back to normal .     people will be looking at other areas , where gold panning is allowed . after the floods of the mid 1990s , \u201cit was good getting for those of us who knew how to look , \u201d he said .     for an amateur , the adventure could lead to frustration . \u201cbut i don \u2019 t want to discourage people from learning about history , getting some fresh air and enjoying themselves , even if they don \u2019 t find anything. \u201d     right now , the water is still high . when dry times arrive , more streambed will be exposed , he said .     \u201ci \u2019 m going to have a ball this summer. \u201d     know the rules     the rules have changed for gold miners . suction dredge equipment is no longer allowed , which includes \u201cmechanized or motorized \u201d systems for removing material from the
