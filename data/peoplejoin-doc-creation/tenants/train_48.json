during a pre-taped town hall-style program on racism set to air tuesday night that she was \u201cfine\u201c in the wake of barr\u2018s remarks . but she added that the controversy should serve as a \u201cteaching moment\u201c on the pervasiveness of everyday racism .     \u201ci think we have to turn it into a teaching moment , \u201c jarrett said , according to a clip released by the network .

barr \u2019 s incendiary comments online . it also marks the end of a show that drew praise from president donald trump , who was supported by both barr and her fictional tv character .     after the premiere of the \u201croseanne \u201d reboot drew nearly 20 million viewers in march , trump celebrated its ratings success during a rally in ohio . \u201clook at her ratings ! look at her ratings ! \u201d trump told the crowd , attributing the figures partly to himself and his supporters .     trump has long touted ratings as a barometer of sorts for success , both as the former face of nbc \u2019 s \u201cthe apprentice \u201d and as a politician . and the popularity of barr \u2019 s program was widely seen as linked to the populist surge that helped trump clinch the presidency in 2016.     asked about barr \u2019 s comments and the subsequent cancellation , white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said on tuesday that trump ' s focus lay elsewhere .     she told reporters aboard air force one that \u201cthe president is focused on north korea . he \u2019 s focused on trade deals . and he \u2019 s focused on rebuilding our military , the economy . and that \u2019 s what he \u2019 s spending his time on , not responding to other things.\u201c     trump himself made no mention of the controversy on tuesday night during a rally for a senate candidate in nashville , tennessee .     abc \u2019 s decision to drop the show was celebrated by several legislators .     \u201cthank you , @abcnetwork . you did the right thing , \u201d tweeted rep. john lewis ( d-ga. ) ,

address incendiary public remarks from barr , who has sparked controversy by propagating unsubstantiated conspiracy theories online . her remarks on jarrett prompted a fresh round of calls for companies to drop their ads on the program .     in a separate twitter screed earlier on tuesday , barr took aim at chelsea clinton , the daughter of former president bill clinton and former secretary of state hillary clinton , as well as at george soros , the billionaire political donor who started the the grantmaking network open society foundations . barr , who is jewish , accused soros of being
