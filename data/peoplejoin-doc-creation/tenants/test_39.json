first u.s. panel recommendation for a long-sought prescription diet pill led its shares to almost double and shows the company benefited from its rivals \u2019 earlier difficulties .     outside advisers to the food and drug administration said weight-loss benefits of orexigen \u2019 s product , contrave , exceed the dangers of elevated pulse and blood pressure and that a large study on cardiovascular risk can wait until after the drug is approved . the fda delayed competing treatments from arena pharmaceuticals inc. and vivus inc. in october after they failed to win panel backing on safety .     \u201cthe fact that they were able to convince the panel not only that the cardiovascular study can wait , but that the drug can be approved , is exciting , particularly after we saw the other obesity drugs voted down , \u201d joshua schimmer , a leerink swann analyst , said yesterday in a telephone interview . \u201cit \u2019 s hard to know to what extent their strategy was altered by the first two , but it sure as heck didn \u2019 t hurt. \u201d     while the fda isn \u2019 t obliged to follow recommendations of advisers , their support eases concern that had caused orexigen shares to drop more than a third this year . the la jolla , california-based company gained from watching the fda \u2019 s safety focus and saw that a commitment to minimize risks and conduct more studies would be needed for approval , schimmer said .     stocks surge     orexigen rose $ 4.01 , or 84 percent , to $ 8.77 at 4 p.m. new york time in nasdaq stock market composite trading , the most in a single day since the shares began trading in april 2007. options traders placed record bets on orexigen last week , saying a positive panel vote would double the company \u2019 s value . vivus shares gained $ 1.20 , or 15 percent , to $ 9 as analysts said the orexigen recommendation suggests the long-term heart risks with vivus \u2019 s drug , qnexa , won \u2019 t need to be studied before

been in a race to introduce the first prescription weight-loss pill in more than a decade . basel , switzerland-based roche holding ag \u2019 s xenical , approved in 1999 , is the only long-term medicine for weight loss since abbott park , illinois-based abbott laboratories \u2019 meridia was pulled off the market in october because of heart risks .     january deadline     orexigen and partner takeda pharmaceutical co. , of osaka , japan , are scheduled to receive a decision from the fda by jan. 31. schimmer said approval may be delayed while the company and the agency work out details of the prescribing information and the new study . he expects contrave and qnexa ultimately to win approval with potential sales of each reaching $ 1 billion or more in the u.s.     \u201cwe learned about the complex issues surrounding obesity therapeutics that are important to the fda and the medical community , and we did our best to address those issues , \u201d orexigen chief executive officer michael narachi said yesterday after the vote .     vivus , based in mountain view , california , said oct. 29 that it plans to respond within six weeks to the fda \u2019 s request for more information about heart risks and birth defects linked to qnexa . this would trigger a new two- to six-month review .     \u201cvivus is encouraged by tuesday \u2019 s advisory committee meeting because it provides hope for patients that new medical treatments for obesity are seriously being considered by the fda , \u201d the company said today in an e-mail .     arena \u2019 s lorcaserin     san diego-based arena said oct. 25 that the fda had questions about tumors seen in studies of rats taking the diet drug lorcaserin , which arena is developing with eisai co. of tokyo . the companies will meet with the agency later this month .     \u201carena is pleased to see the recognition of the need for obesity medications , \u201d the company said in an e-mail today . \u201cat

target different parts of the brain that influence appetite and cravings . the pill contains bupropion , an antidepressant also used to quit smoking , and naltrexone , a treatment for alcohol and painkiller addiction .     study results     two tablets of contrave twice a day helped twice as many patients in studies lose at least 5 percent of their weight compared with a placebo after 56 weeks . the drug missed the fda \u2019 s second standard of effectiveness in failing to show at least a 5 percent benefit over placebo . patients on the drug also had higher pulse and blood pressure than patients on placebo , even after losing weight .     dissident members of the advisory panel said contrave shouldn \u2019 t be approved without a large study of heart risks because it counteracts some of the expected benefits of weight loss , a signal that it may have long-term complications .     \u201cthis drug resembles sibutramine , \u201d said panel member sanjay kaul , using the chemical name for meridia . \u201cthere is an opportunity for us to learn from history or else we \u2019 re going to repeat it . we need to make sure we get it right this time. \u201d     kaul is the director of

court has launched an initial inquiry into allegations of crimes against humanity committed by rodrigo duterte , the philippine president , in his brutal anti-drugs crusade .     a report submitted to the icc last year laid out evidence that duterte had been directly responsible for \u201cextrajudicial executions and mass murder \u201d over three decades since he began his war on drugs as mayor of davao in 1988.     thousands dead : the philippine president , the death squad allegations and a brutal drugs war read more     according to official statistics , 4,000 people have been killed by the police in anti-drug operations since duterte became president . however , the 77-page report submitted by a philippine lawyer , jude sabio , alleged the death toll was over 8,000.     the icc prosecutor fatou bensouda said in a statement that her office would \u201canalyse crimes allegedly committed \u2026 since at least 1 july 2016 in the context of the \u2018war on drugs \u2019 campaign \u201d . the inquiry will be the icc \u2019 s first preliminary examination in a south-east asian nation .     gary alejano , an opposition politician who tried to get duterte impeached last year and submitted evidence to the icc as part of the complaint , said the move was an affirmation that the claims against duterte had legitimacy , and it offered \u201ca ray of hope for the victims of his war on drugs , which is still ongoing right now \u201d .         he said : \u201cin this country , people are at a loss where to go if members of your family feel victim to the war on drugs . they cannot go to police because they are involved , they cannot go to the department of justice because the secretary will say there \u2019 s no such thing as extrajudicial killing . and when we request an investigation from the house of representatives , we can not get an impartial hearing because they are covering up for the president . there is a clear and blatant violation of the rule of law in the philippines right now , and so the icc are the only ones who can step in. \u201d     alejano said he believed they had a \u201cstrong case , if we are given the opportunity to be heard. \u201d     duterte \u2019 s spokesperson , harry roque , described the inquiry as a \u201cwaste of the court \u2019 s time and resources , \u201d stressing that many of the allegations predated the philippines signing up to the icc in 2011 , and therefore could not be considered . however , bensouda specifically referenced killings since 1 july 2016 in her statement .     roque said continuing with the investigation would undermine the sovereignty of the philippines \u201cbecause the domestic courts are functioning and willing to entertain this matter \u2026 and the alleged deaths , if true , were because of a legitimate police exercise. \u201d     he alleged that \u201cdomestic enemies \u201d were behind the complaint and said duterte was prepared to go on trial and defend his actions , though he said he was confident the icc would not proceed . \u201che \u2019 s sick and tried of being accused . he wants to be in court and put the prosecutor on the stand , \u201d roque said .     since securing a landslide victory in the 2016 elections on a pledge to kill tens of thousands of criminals and eradicate drugs in philippine society , duterte has authorised police to violently crack down on illegal drug use , urging them to kill suspects and promising to protect them from prosecution . his abrasive tongue and brutal methods have kept him popular in the philippines , where he enjoys high approval ratings and legislative support .     he maintains that the thousands who died were suspects who resisted arrest , but human rights groups and political opponents allege that many murders have been carried out and covered up .     when he was mayor of davao , duterte \u2019 s crackdown on criminals was often carried out by vigilante groups , known as death squads , allegedly with his approval . the thousands of deaths in davao were part of the complaint filed to the icc .     duterte \u2019 s war on drugs leaves tragic legacy for filipino families \u2013 in pictures read more     duterte is notorious for his dislike of the icc , calling it \u201cbullshit \u201d , \u201chypocritical \u201d and \u201cuseless \u201d , and he has threatened to withdraw his country \u2019 s membership multiple times , even daring the court to bring him to trial .     human rights watch , which has been calling for an independent international investigation into duterte \u2019 s war on drugs , welcomed the icc \u2019 s move . phil robertson , a deputy director in its asia division , said the icc \u201cabsolutely should initiate a full investigation into these alleged crimes because to date there has been no serious attempt to investigate them by the philippines police or prosecutors , much less take suspected killers to court \u201d .     the icc defines crimes against humanity as \u201cserious violations committed as part of a large-scale attack against any civilian population \u201d . since it was established in 2002 , the court in the hague has received more than 12,000 complaints or communications , and nine cases have gone to trial .\n"}]}, "user_id_to_descriptions": {"alice": "Is interested in compiling a summary.", "bhushan": "Knows about the following
