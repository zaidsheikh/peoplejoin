( marcus yam / the seattle times )     on thursday , a search-and-rescue helicopter team spotted the couple \u2019 s extensively damaged vehicles next to a clear-cut area north of the couple \u2019 s 20-acre farm along the stillaguamish river . the vehicles , a land rover and jeep wrangler , had been pushed or driven over an embankment and partly concealed by cut branches . the land rover apparently became stuck on the edge of the embankment , a mound , and appeared to have been \u201cpried \u201d over it with a digging tool or lever , records say .     at the top of the embankment , investigators also found a new tarp spread out over a mound covered with cut branches and debris , the affidavit states .     near the vehicles , investigators later recovered an ace hardware bag , an ax , rubber gloves , tarps , posts and other items , records say . detectives traced the items to a hardware store in arlington , whose owner recalled john reed as a frequent customer who he \u2019 d seen at the store april 13.     armed with a warrant , detectives searched reed \u2019 s property saturday , finding \u201cred stains , which appeared to be dried blood , \u201d in and around the bathtub and a pair of coveralls with apparent blood stains . they also found two rifles and ammunition , and gloves , a tarp and posts similar to those recovered near the couple \u2019 s vehicles , the records say .     investigators also obtained video from a property owner \u2019 s security camera along a road heading toward where the vehicles were found . it captured a jeep and a land rover being driven up the road at 3 : 31 a.m. on april 12 \u2014 hours after shunn and patenaude were last seen , records say .     about six hours later , the camera also recorded a red toyota pickup with a winch on the front headed up the road with what may have been a post in the back , the records say .     based on the evidence , snohomish county sheriff ty trenary announced sunday investigators believe the couple are dead and named the reed brothers as suspects in their slayings .     the brothers are both felons who are considered armed and dangerous , the sheriff said .     john reed \u2019 s red toyota pickup was recovered saturday in the garage of his parents \u2019 ellensburg home , the records show . the truck \u2019 s ownership registration had been transferred to the name of reed \u2019 s mother one day earlier , the records say .     the brothers now may be driving their parents \u2019 red 2007 volkswagen eos coupe with washington plates axh5106 .     two months after the deadly landslide in 2014 , john reed shared his experiences of witnessing and surviving the catastrophe with the seattle times .     he said then he knew the rugged terrain around oso extensively . he also noted he was drawn to his lot by the privacy he enjoyed at the end of the road , and noted he had no plans to move off his land , where he had lived for 18 years .     but the disaster apparently took an emotional toll .     after the mudslide , deputies took a report that reed had threatened fema workers at the oso fire hall \u201cin regard to his displeasure about the landslide and associated response. \u201d     the deputies were told \u201creed made a loud comment about driving his truck through the building and taking everyone out with him , \u201d the warrant records say .     reed later explained he was very upset that his slide-damaged driveway hadn \u2019 t been fixed , saying he feared if he didn \u2019 t get money to fix it , his property would be condemned .     a day after shunn and patenaude were reported missing , former deputy bruce cheek , who lives on the same road as the missing couple , contacted a detective to describe an incident involving john reed shortly after the 2014 slide .     \u201ccheek stated reed was expressing extreme anger about the slide and named a list of people whom reed blamed ( cheek did not remember the names ) , \u201d the records state . \u201ccheek stated reed expressed in a serious tone that he was capable of killing people without any problems , he could shoot them and then ` they \u2019 would never be able to locate the bodies as he ( reed ) would get rid of them in the area of timber above the slide area. \u201d\n"}], "cassie": [{"url": "file://val/30/0/0", "title": "val/30/0/0", "content": "\u00d7

captured in mexico .     reed , 53 , was captured by mexican authorities on friday , according to the snohomish county sheriff \u2019 s office .     authorities from the policia estatal investigadora located reed in sonora , mexico , and expelled him from the country for violation of mexican immigration laws , the sheriff \u2019 s office said . he was taken into custody at the border by the u.s. marshals service and booked into pima county jail in arizona .     it was not immediately known when reed would be extradited to washington .     police say reed fled to mexico after killing his former neighbors patrick shunn , 45 , and his wife , monique patenaude , 46 , in april . he is charged with two counts of first-degree murder . reed reportedly had a property dispute with the couple and had threatened them , investigators say .     reed \u2019 s brother , tony reed , and their parents have been charged with helping john reed .     tony reed pleaded guilty in june to two counts of rendering criminal assistance . parents clyde reed , 81 , and faye reed , 77 , have each been charged with one count of rendering criminal assistance .     according to prosecutors , john reed shot patenaude three times after she returned home from running errands in arlington during the late-morning hours of april 11. shunn was fatally shot once in the midafternoon of the same day when he returned home from work , charging documents say .     reed drove that evening to ellensburg , where his parents and brother live . he stayed there for an hour and returned with tony reed , arriving back at the slain couple \u2019 s property around midnight , according to the charges .     tony reed , 49 , later told detectives he saw patenaude \u2019 s body in her jeep while shunn \u2019 s body was inside his land rover , according to the documents .     the brothers waited until 3 a.m. april 12 to each drive a vehicle up north brooks creek road , where they buried the bodies and then dumped the jeep and land rover over a steep embankment several miles from the burial site , the papers say .     the brothers walked back to john reed \u2019 s old property and , over the next two days , allegedly tried to conceal and destroy evidence of the killings .     john and tony reed arrived back in ellensburg no later than april 14 , when john reed attempted to cash a $ 96,595 cashier \u2019 s check \u2014 money paid to him for his property after the oso landslide .     but the bank wouldn \u2019 t cash such a large check , so reed had the payment split into five separate checks . reed had two checks for $ 14,000 each made payable to his parents , and a $ 40,000 check made payable to him . he signed that larger check over to his father .     reed \u2019 s father was seen on a surveillance video with his son at the bank during the transaction .     on april 15 , reed and his mother went to the state department of licensing office in ellensburg , where he transferred the title of his red pickup to her .     she later \u201cgifted \u201d her son her vehicle , which he and his brother drove to arizona , leaving it behind before they crossed into mexico .     clyde and faye reed deposited three checks totaling $ 68,000 into their bank accounts , only to learn snohomish county sheriff \u2019 s detectives had frozen the money so it couldn \u2019 t be accessed ,
