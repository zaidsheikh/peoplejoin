  what i think is even more politically and morally suspect \u2013 and has gotten very little attention -- lerner actually presided over the bizarre , bumbling rollout of the story , by planting a question about the controversy with an attorney at an american bar association conference . according to morgan lewis tax lawyer celia roady , lerner herself asked that roady inquire about whether the irs had targeted conservative groups . that led to lerner \u2019 s public apology \u2013 and the scandal swirling around the white house , which found itself surprised by the sudden disclosure .     the invaluable tax-policy expert david cay johnston called for lerner \u2019 s firing a week ago \u2013 and that was even before there was proof that she had set up the question at the aba conference

placed on administrative leave , according to congressional aides .         she will still be paid while on leave , a congressional aide said , as required under civil service rules .     lerner , who heads an irs division that oversees tax-exempt groups , first disclosed the extra scrutiny the agency gave to tea party groups almost two weeks ago when answering a planted question at a washington legal conference .     since then , lawmakers from across the political spectrum have said that they believe lerner misled them and have called for her dismissal .         sen. chuck grassley ( iowa ) , a senior republican on the finance committee , said in a thursday statement that new acting irs commissioner danny werfel had asked lerner to resign \u2014 and that lerner was only placed on leave after she declined that request . aides on capitol hill confirmed that lerner had refused to resign .     in her first public appearance since the disclosure , lerner on wednesday invoked her fifth amendment rights against self-incrimination at a house oversight hearing .         advertisement     the irs announced in an internal memo circulated to the media that ken corbin will be taking over as the acting director of the tax-exempt organizations division . corbin , a 25-year veteran at the irs , has been deputy director in a division that processed millions of tax returns a year .     lerner \u2019 s move to administrative leave comes after president obama pushed out acting irs commissioner steven miller over his role in the targeting . werfel , formerly a senior official at the office of management and budget , took over as acting commissioner on wednesday .         the irs also announced after the controversy broke that joseph grant , lerner \u2019 s boss at the agency , will retire in early june .         lerner will likely have to make her way back to capitol hill in the coming weeks , after house oversight chairman darrell issa ( r-calif. ) concluded that she waved her rights against self-incrimination by defending herself in an opening statement at wednesday ' s hearing .         sens . carl levin ( d-mich. ) and john mccain ( r-ariz. ) on thursday became the latest prominent lawmakers to call for lerner to be removed , in a letter to werfel made public shortly before news of lerner \u2019 s administrative leave broke .         reps. sandy levin ( d-mich. ) , joe crowley ( d-n.y ) and elijah cummings ( d-md. ) have also called for lerner to be pushed out .     \" in naming ken corbin as acting director to replace lois lerner , the administration has taken a strong step to address serious mistakes made by the irs exempt organization division , \" levin said in a statement . \" this and further corrective action are vital in restoring the confidence of the american people . \"         according to a treasury audit , lerner found out in june 2011 that irs staffers were giving extra scrutiny to conservative groups seeking tax-exempt 501( c ) ( 4 ) status by searching for organizations with names like \u201ctea party \u201d and \u201cpatriots. \u201d         lerner immediately ordered that the criteria targeting conservative groups be changed , but staffers in a cincinnati office eventually once again implemented more political screening criteria , according to the audit .         \u201ci have not done anything wrong . i have not broken any laws . i have not violated any irs rules or regulations , and i have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee , \u201d lerner told house oversight on

\u2019 s inspector general for tax administration , also found that some groups waited months , even years , for their tax-exempt applications to be approved .         national review first reported that lerner was being placed on administrative leave .     the publication also reported late thursday that letters suggest lerner was directly involved in the agency \u2019 s targeting of

( april 23 ) ap     surgeons at the johns hopkins university school of medicine announced monday that they have performed the first total penis and scrotum transplant on an american military veteran . ( photo : getty images )     a u.s. serviceman severely injured several years ago in an ied blast in afghanistan has received the world ' s first total penis and scrotum transplant , surgeons at the johns hopkins university school of medicine announced monday .     the man , whose identity was not released , is recovering well and expected to regain both urinary and sexual function , richard redett , who led the transplant team , said at a monday telephone news conference .     the patient did not receive testicles from his donor to avoid the ethical issues that might ensue if he later had children , said damon cooney , another transplant team member . the testicles would have contained sperm from the recently deceased donor .     the donor was not identified , nor was his cause of death , but in a statement , his family praised the sergeant \u2019 s service to his country and noted the donor family includes a number of veterans .     \u201cwe are so thankful to say that our loved one would be proud and honored to know he provided such a special gift to you , \u201d said the statement , read by alexandra glazier , president and ceo of new england donor services , which arranged for the donation . \u201cwe hope you can return to better health very soon and we continue to wish you a speedy recovery. \u201d     two years ago , surgeons at massachusetts general hospital performed a more limited transplant on a penile cancer patient . that patient , thomas manning , continues to do well , though his sexual function hasn \u2019 t fully recovered yet , said curtis cetrulo , who runs the reconstructive transplantation program at massachusetts general . the hospital has yet to conduct another penile transplant , as it awaits funding and other logistical issues , he said .     there have also been several successful penile transplants in south africa , as well as an unsuccessful one in china .     the johns hopkins surgery , performed in a 14-hour procedure in late march , was the most extensive yet , involving more tissue than has been previously transplanted , the surgeons said .     in addition to a large skin graft covering part of the sergeant \u2019 s abdomen , penis and scrotum , surgeons connected three arteries , four veins and two nerves to provide blood flow and sensation to the donated tissue . his internal organs were not severely damaged by the blast .     redett said he expects the patient will regain the ability to urinate by the time he leaves the hospital later this week . it will take about six months for the nerves to regrow enough to restore sexual function and sensation , but redett said he is optimistic that will take place .     johns hopkins covered the cost of the procedure , and hopes to complete more in the near future , said w. p. andrew lee , who directs the hospital \u2019 s department of plastic and reconstructive surgery .     the hospital does not plan to use the procedure for gender reassignment surgery , he said .     once it becomes more routine , penile transplantation is likely to cost about the same as a liver transplant , said l. scott levin , chairman of orthopedic surgery and a professor of plastic surgery at penn medicine . ( one recent estimate puts the total cost of a liver transplant in the united states above $ 800,000. ) it is still an open question who will pay for such procedures , levin said .     another major issue in transplantation is rejection . the recipient \u2019 s body may reject the donated tissue at any time , so the johns hopkins patient will have to be on continuous therapy to tamp down his immune system , said gerald brandacher , who handled the immune aspects of the johns hopkins transplant .     to reduce the risk of rejection , the patient was also infused with bone marrow from the donor . this approach has been used in eight other patients who received transplants , such as arms , that were transformative but not lifesaving . balancing the donor \u2019 s bone marrow with the recipient \u2019 s allows the patient to take only one low-dose medication a day instead of the three typically taken by transplant patients , brandacher said .     injuries that affect sexual and urinary function can be devastating to a person \u2019 s identity , self-esteem and intimate relationships , said lee , whose department has been preparing for penile transplantations since 2013.     \u201cwe believe that genital-urinary transplantation can help those warriors with missing genitalia , just as hand and arm transplants transformed the lives of amputees , \u201d he said .     at massachusetts general , publicity surrounding the penile transplant encouraged other patients with genitourinary tissue damage to seek care .     \u201cwe \u2019 ve had many people who are really despondent come out of the shadows and get worked up , \u201d cetrulo said .     even if they weren \u2019 t transplant candidates they have now been helped in other ways , cetrulo said , noting many people with these conditions consider suicide , and suffer even more emotional pain than people in need of arm or face transplants .     hopefully , the johns hopkins ' patient will inspire others to seek help , cetrulo said . \u201cthat \u2019 s one of the most incredible and important contributions of this case , not only to this individual whose life has probably been saved. \u201d

, \" johns hopkins university surgeons rebuilt the man ' s entire pelvic region \u2014 transplanting a penis , scrotum and part of the abdominal wall from a deceased donor \u2014 in a highly experimental 14-hour operation last month .     such transplants \" can help those warriors with missing genitalia just as hand and arm transplant transformed the lives of amputees , \" dr. w.p . andrew lee , hopkins ' chairman of plastic and reconstructive surgery , told reporters monday .     the patient , who asked to remain anonymous , is expected to recover urinary and , eventually , sexual function .     the scrotum transplant did not include the donor ' s testicles , meaning reproduction won ' t be possible . \" we just felt there were too many unanswered ethical questions \" with that extra step , said hopkins ' dr. damon cooney .     three other successful penis transplants have been reported , two in south africa and one in 2016 at massachusetts general hospital . those transplants involved only the penis , not extensive surrounding tissue that made this transplant much more complex .     the loss of a penis , whether from cancer , accident or war injury , is emotionally traumatic , affecting urination , sexual intimacy and the ability to conceive a child . many patients suffer in silence because of the stigma their injuries sometimes carry .     doctors sometimes reconstruct the form of a penis from a patient ' s own skin , usually to treat congenital abnormalities or during transgender surgery . that requires using implants to achieve erection .     for a functional penis transplant , surgeons must connect tiny nerves and blood vessels . candidates face some serious risks , including rejection of the tissue and side effects from anti-rejection drugs that must be taken for life .     but penis transplants have generated intense interest among veterans from iraq and afghanistan , and a few years ago hopkins surgeons began planning and rehearsing how to perform such a complex operation in patients with widespread tissue damage . the department of defense trauma registry has recorded 1,367 male service members who survived with genitourinary injuries between 2001 and 2013. it ' s not clear how many victims lost all or part of the penis .     hopkins is screening additional veterans to see if they are good candidates for this type of reconstructive transplant . finding donors is an additional hurdle : in the u.s. , people or their families who agree to donate organs such as the heart or lung must be asked separately about also donating a penis , hand , face or other body part .     the hopkins patient received an extra experimental step , an infusion of bone marrow from his donor that research suggests may help a recipient ' s immune system better tolerate a transplant . surgeons said that is enabling the veteran to take one anti-rejection drug instead of several .     in a statement from hopkins , the patient was quoted as saying : \" when i first woke up , i felt finally more normal . \"     ___     the associated press health &amp; science department receives support from the howard hughes medical

therapeutic release , according to a new book written by bob woodward , says a report in sunday ' s edition of the chicago sun-times .     the first lady declined a personal adviser ' s suggestion that she address jesus christ , however , because it would be \" too personal , \" according to woodward ' s book , \" the choice . \"     the book , which is still to be published , takes a behind-the-scenes look at the clintons , as well as bob and elizabeth dole .     woodward says the adviser was jean houston , co-director of the foundation for mind research , which he describes as a group that studies the psychic experience and altered and expanded consciousness .     the book portrays houston as an influential adviser who urged mrs. clinton to write her book , \" it takes a village and other lessons children teach us , \" and in the process \" virtually moved into the white house \" for days at a time to help with revisions , the sun-times reported .     woodward suggests the white house hoped to keep mrs. clinton ' s relationship with houston and her talks with the dead a secret .     \" most people in the white house did not know about hillary ' s sessions with houston . ... to some of the few who did , the meetings could trigger politically damaging comparisons to nancy reagan ' s use of astrology , \" woodward wrote .     mrs. clinton ' s spokeswoman , lisa caputo , is quoted in the sun-times as saying the first lady ' s interest in houston is no secret .     woodward says anthropologist mary catherine bateson , daughter of famed anthropologist margaret mead , joined her in sessions of imaginary conversations .     woodward is an assistant managing editor at the washington post . as a reporter , he helped break the watergate scandal with carl bernstein .     mrs. clinton herself wrote about her imaginary conversations with eleanor roosevelt in her june 10 column . she said she talked to roosevelt about the role of a first lady .     \" she usually responds by telling me to buck up , or at least to grow skin as thick as a rhinoceros , \" mrs. clinton wrote .     in the column , she described houston as an expert on philosophy and mythology . \" ( houston ) has shared her views with me on everything from the ancient greeks to the lives of women and children on bangladesh , \" she wrote .     mrs. clinton also acknowledged her
