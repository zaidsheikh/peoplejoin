and licensing its patent portfolio , according to both companies .     in 2003 , nokia ' s cell phone market share exceeded 35 % . that same year , its phone business alone posted an operating profit of 5.48 billion euros . today ' s sale price , which includes 1.65 billion euros in patents , is just 5.44 billion euros . it ' s been a rough decade .     nokia ' s cell phone collapse has been a spectacular one . the finnish giant dominated the dumbphone era after motorola , another faded star that recently fell into the hands of a comparative upstart . but it was blindsided by apple , then deprived of a chance to regain its footing by an even more aggressive google , which followed close behind .     the story , in hindsight , is simple : nokia did not have a truly compelling smartphone ready when a large segment of the developed world was first compelled by smartphones . whether this was the result of complacency \u2014 nokia was , in the mid-2000s , the leader of the niche smartphone category \u2014 doesn ' t matter now .     nokia ' s miscalculations became impossible to ignore in 2008 , the same year microsoft decided , internally at least , to scrap its ancient and inadequate windows mobile platform in favor of something entirely new . under these circumstances , it ' s easy to imagine how a sort of camaraderie might have emerged at the time , or at least a mutual sympathy . certainly a shared interest : to break back into the market from which they had been unceremoniously expelled .     during the next two years , while microsoft readied windows phone 7 and nokia floundered on , the seeds of sunday ' s deal were sewn . a chastened nokia was a natural partner for the tardy but determined microsoft ; it needed a software solution and microsoft needed help with hardware . the 2009 vision of 2013 renders clearly : two giants , united after some missteps , regain their rightful place . by 2010 , when the head of microsoft ' s business division left to take the helm at nokia , the gears were moving . many at the time wondered if stephen elop ' s time at nokia would be spent grooming the company for purchase \u2014 a foreigner in all possible ways , he began his time at the company with a memo rightly but offensively declaring nokia ' s proud platform a failure , and quickly pledged the company ' s commitment to the still-tiny windows phone . it felt like a radical about-face , but no matter : nokia and microsoft were going to save each other .     now , with elop returning to microsoft after a job well done \u2014 well , a job , done \u2014 that plan has come to fruition . the only problem is that there ' s little left to save . windows phone has barely dented the now much larger smartphone market . nokia hasn ' t had a windows phone hit . this incongruity \u2014 between a successfully executed , slyly strategic long-term merger plan and a much grander , more general sense of failure \u2014 might explain microsoft ' s deeply strange and somewhat sad stated goals for its nokia acquisition .     microsoft ' s \" strategic rationale , \" titled \" accelerating growth , \" is a disjointed and bizarre document . it manages to sound both insane and uninspiring , outlining modest goals that still sound unrealistic .     for example , it lays out a plan to pull in over $ 45 billion dollars in smartphone revenue by 2018. but it plans on doing this by securing just 15 % of the projected global smartphone market \u2014 not exactly a world-beating plan , keeping in mind the time frame . consider : 2018 is five years away . five years ago was the year the app store first opened .\n"}, {"url": "file://test/1/0/3", "title": "test/1/0/3", "content": "hello there ,         there is a pertinent story about a man who was working on an oil platform in the north sea . he woke up one night from a loud explosion , which suddenly set his entire oil platform on fire . in mere moments , he was surrounded by flames . through the smoke and heat , he barely made his way out of the chaos to the platform ' s edge . when he looked down over the edge , all he could see were the dark , cold , foreboding atlantic waters .         as the fire approached him , the man had mere seconds to react . he could stand on the platform , and inevitably be consumed by the burning flames . or , he could plunge 30 meters in to the freezing waters . the man was standing upon a \" burning platform , \" and he needed to make a choice .         he decided to jump . it was unexpected . in ordinary circumstances , the man would never consider plunging into icy waters . but these were not ordinary times - his platform was on fire . the man survived the fall and the waters . after he was rescued , he noted that a \" burning platform \" caused a radical change in his behaviour .         we too , are standing on a \" burning platform , \" and we must decide how we are going to change our behaviour .         over the past few months , i ' ve shared with you what i ' ve heard from our shareholders , operators , developers , suppliers and from you . today , i ' m going to share what i ' ve learned and what i have come to believe .         i have learned that we are standing on a burning platform .         and , we have more than one explosion - we have multiple points of scorching heat that are fuelling a blazing fire around us .         for example , there is intense heat coming from our competitors , more rapidly than we ever expected . apple disrupted the market by redefining the smartphone and attracting developers to a closed , but very powerful ecosystem .         in 2008 , apple ' s market share in the $ 300+ price range was 25 percent ; by 2010 it escalated to 61 percent . they are enjoying a tremendous growth trajectory with a 78 percent earnings growth year over year in q4 2010. apple demonstrated that if designed well , consumers would buy a high-priced phone with a great experience and developers would build applications . they changed the game , and today , apple owns the high-end range .         and then , there is android . in about two years , android created a platform that attracts application developers , service providers and hardware manufacturers . android came in at the high-end , they are now winning the mid-range , and quickly they are going downstream to phones under \u20ac 100 . google has become a gravitational force , drawing much of the industry ' s innovation to its core .         let ' s not forget about the low-end price range . in 2008 , mediatek supplied complete reference designs for phone chipsets , which enabled manufacturers in the shenzhen region of china to produce phones at an unbelievable pace . by some accounts , this ecosystem now produces more than one third of the phones sold globally - taking share from us in emerging markets .         while competitors poured flames on our market share , what happened at nokia ? we fell behind , we missed big trends , and we lost time . at that time , we thought we were making the right decisions ; but , with the benefit of hindsight , we now find ourselves years behind .         the first iphone shipped in 2007 , and we still don ' t have a product that is close to their experience . android came on the scene just over 2 years ago , and this week they took our leadership position in smartphone volumes . unbelievable .         we have some brilliant sources of innovation inside nokia , but we are not bringing it to market fast enough . we thought meego would be a platform for winning high-end smartphones . however , at this rate , by the end of 2011 , we might have only one meego product in the market .         at the midrange , we have symbian . it has proven to be non-competitive in leading markets like north america . additionally , symbian is proving to be an increasingly difficult environment in which to develop to meet the continuously expanding consumer requirements , leading to slowness in product development and also creating a disadvantage when we seek to take advantage of new hardware platforms . as a result , if we continue like before , we will get further and further behind , while our competitors advance further and further ahead .         at the lower-end price range , chinese oems are cranking out a device much faster than , as one nokia employee said only partially in jest , \" the time that it takes us to polish a powerpoint presentation . \" they are fast , they are cheap , and they are challenging us .         and the truly perplexing aspect is that we ' re not even fighting with the right weapons . we are still too often trying to approach each price range on a device-to-device basis .         the battle of devices has now become a war of ecosystems , where ecosystems include not only the hardware and software of the device , but developers , applications , ecommerce , advertising , search , social applications , location-based services , unified communications and many other things . our competitors aren ' t taking our market share with devices ; they are taking our market share with an entire ecosystem . this means we ' re going to have to decide how we either build , catalyse or join an ecosystem .         this is one of the decisions we need to make . in the meantime , we ' ve lost market share , we ' ve lost mind share and we ' ve lost time .         on tuesday , standard &amp; poor ' s informed that they will put our a long term and a-1 short term ratings on negative credit watch . this is a similar rating action to the one that moody ' s took last week . basically it means that during the next few weeks they will make an analysis of nokia , and decide on a possible credit rating downgrade . why are these credit agencies contemplating these changes ? because they are concerned about our competitiveness .         consumer preference for nokia declined worldwide . in the uk , our brand preference has slipped to 20 percent , which is 8 percent lower than last year . that means only 1 out of 5 people in the uk prefer nokia to other brands . it ' s also down in the other markets , which are traditionally our strongholds : russia , germany , indonesia , uae , and on and on and on .         how did we get to this point ? why did we fall behind when the world around us evolved ?         this is what i have been trying to understand . i believe at least some of it has been due to our attitude inside nokia . we poured gasoline on our own burning platform . i believe we have lacked accountability and leadership to align and direct the company through these disruptive times . we had a series of misses . we haven ' t been delivering innovation fast enough . we ' re not collaborating internally .         nokia , our platform is burning .         we are working on a path forward -- a path to rebuild our market leadership . when we share the new strategy on february 11 , it will be a huge effort to transform our company . but , i believe that together , we can face the challenges ahead of us . together , we can choose to define our future .         the burning platform , upon which the man found himself , caused the man to shift his behaviour , and take a bold and brave step into an uncertain future . he was able to tell his story . now , we have a great opportunity to do the same .         stephen .\n"}, {"url": "file://test/1/1/0", "title": "test/1/1/0", "content": "after a year in which liberals scored impressive , high-profile supreme court victories , conservatives could be in line for wins on some of this term ' s most contentious issues , as the justices consider cases that could gut public sector labor unions and roll back affirmative action at state universities .     however , as the court ' s new term kicks off monday , uncertainty surrounds several other politically potent cases that could wind up on the court \u2019 s agenda .     story continued below     litigation over state efforts to limit abortion by regulating clinics and doctors is making its way to the high court . and the justices are already facing a batch of petitions involving the rights of religious institutions to opt out of providing contraception under obamacare .     both issues seem likely to land on this term ' s docket , although the justices haven \u2019 t formally taken up either .     many in the obama administration would also like to see the court weigh in on immigration in coming months , upholding the president \u2019 s right to grant quasi-legal status and work permits to millions of immigrants who entered the u.s. illegally as children .     but it \u2019 s unclear whether that fight will get to the justices in time for a decision this term or whether obama \u2019 s effort to expand his executive actions on immigration will remain blocked by a lower court order until the president leaves office .     here \u2019 s politico \u2019 s look at five of the most important cases the justices could grapple with soon :     a potential body blow to labor     public-employee unions and politicians of both parties are keenly focused on a california dispute about whether states can compel government employees to pay union dues . a loss for the unions could sharply diminish the clout of a movement already struggling with its political relevance .     the case , friedrichs v. california teachers association , was brought by orange county , calif. schoolteacher rebecca friedrichs and other teachers , who are arguing that forcing them to pay union dues violates their first amendment rights . they also contend that unions should have to get permission before collecting dues used for political purposes , as opposed to the current system that requires objecting employees to opt out .     \u201cthe significance is substantial , either way it comes out , \u201d said university of california at irvine law professor catherine fisk . \u201cthe reason why conservative lawyers are bringing these case is the hope that a significant number of government employees choose not to join the union and certain government employee unions will be weaker. \u201d     the roberts court has not been friendly to unions , issuing a 5-4 ruling last year that prohibited mandatory union fees for home health workers but stopped short of banning so-called \u201cagency shops \u201d in government .     the new case directly asks the justices to overturn a 38-year-old precedent that allows all workers covered by union negotiations to be charged for representation .     how the case will be resolved is unclear , partly because the conservative justices often see limits on government employee \u2019 s first amendment rights when their speech is at issue . fisk said the unions are \u201crationally fearful \u201d about what the court will do , but she thinks the justices might end up dumping the case after it \u2019 s heard . \u201ci think the case raises so many doctrinal problems for them , \u201d she said .         higher ed affirmative action back in the crosshairs     two years after punting the case back to an appeals court , the justices will take a second crack at resolving a dispute about the constitutionality of the university of texas at austin ' s affirmative action program . the case was brought by rejected applicant abigail fisher , who contends she was rejected because of her race .     the last time fisher \u2019 s case went before the high court , affirmative action opponents hoped it would serve as a vehicle to pare back preferences for racial and ethnic groups at government-run schools . however , the justices instead told the 5th circuit it had been too deferential to the university of texas \u2019 s claims that the programs were narrowly tailored to promote diversity . justice anthony kennedy won the support of six other justices for a decision that said such programs must be handled with \" strict scrutiny , \u201d but the decision did not suggest they were automatically unconstitutional .     justice elena kagan has recused herself because she was involved in the case during her previous service as solicitor general . the real question is whether kennedy will join the four other republican appointees in setting such a high bar for affirmative action that many public colleges will abandon the preferences and admissions practices they use to achieve racial and ethnic diversity .         the meaning of \" one person , one vote \u2019     a texas case has the potential to deal a blow to latino political clout , tilting the balance of power away from urban areas and towards suburban and rural areas with more white voters . evenwel v. abbott presents the question of whether state legislative districts can be apportioned using a count of eligible voters rather than a count of all people .     if immigrants ( both illegal and legal ) as well as children can be left out of the count , \u201cthe rural areas where voters tend to have fewer non-citizens or where there are fewer young people concentrated would necessarily gain , \u201d said new york university law professor rick pildes . \u201cit \u2019 s a reasonable inference if the urban areas are more democratic leaning that they would lose power to more republican rural areas. \u201d     congressional redistricting shouldn \u2019 t be directly affected by the case , pildes said , because the constitution says the u.s. census used for that reapportionment should be based on each state ' s population . but others say the ruling could spill over into congressional redistricting down the line .         religious nonprofits and obamacare     in the hobby lobby case last year , the justices allowed for-profit companies to seek religious exemptions from obamacare \u2019 s coverage requirements . but now , several religious-affiliated schools and institutions \u2013 including the little sisters of the poor nursing home in denver \u2013 have filed lawsuits , too .     they argue that the administration \u2019 s process for allowing religious nonprofits to opt out of the contraception requirement requires them to violate their religious beliefs . the supreme court has eight petitions \u2013 including one that just arrived from the federal government \u2014 on this issue .     some prominent judges are effectively begging the supreme court to jump in by lamenting the refusal of some courts to protect the largely-catholic religious entities from sanctions for failing to fill out paperwork that triggers the contraception exemption but also sets in motion coverage from others .     \u201chow ironic that this most consequential claim of religious free exercise , with literally millions of dollars in fines and immortal souls on the line , should be denied when nearly every other individual religious freedom claim has been upheld by this court , \u201d 5th circuit judge edith jones complained in a dissent last week . \u201chow tragic to see the humiliation of sincere religious practitioners , which , coming from the federal government and its courts , implicitly denigrates the orthodoxy to which their lives bear testament . and both ironic and tragic is the harm to the judeo-christian heritage whose practitioners brought religious toleration to full fruition in this nation . undermine this heritage , as our founders knew , and the props of morality and civic virtue will be destroyed. \u201d     the justices haven \u2019 t signaled which of the challenges , if any , they \u2019 ll consider but are expected to do so in the coming weeks .         testing when abortion clinic regulations go too far     two of the latest tactics in the abortion wars could wind up before the justices this term : requirements that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and that abortion clinics meet standards for hospitals or surgical centers .     an appeals court has upheld most such limits in texas , but in june the supreme court voted , 5-4 , to block key parts of the law until the justices decide whether to weigh in . petitions to take up that case and a similar law in mississippi are already pending at the supreme court .     supporters of the laws say they are designed to protect women ' s health , but abortion providers and abortion rights advocates say the laws would force many clinics to close and penalize poor women who could not afford travel to distant clinics .     a similar wisconsin law led to combative oral arguments in front of the 7th circuit last week . judge richard posner suggested the law was a transparent effort to prevent abortions , not aid women .     \u201cgovernor walker , before he withdrew from the presidential competition , said he thought abortion should be forbidden even if the mother dies as a result , \" judge richard posner said to a lawyer for the state , in remarks first reported by the milwaukee journal-sentinel . \" is that kind of official wisconsin policy ? \"     \u201cthat perhaps is governor walker \u2019 s personal view , but it \u2019 s not a state policy , \u201d assistant attorney general brian keenan replied . keenan insisted requiring doctors to have admitting privileges was a reasonable precaution to aid women .     \u201cthe admitting privileges would benefit the continuity of care for the woman when she goes to that hospital , \u201d he said .     posner said the fact that the law was intended to kick in one business day after it was passed made clear the authors ' intentions . \u201cthat statute can \u2019 t be justified in terms of women \u2019 s health , \u201d the judge said .     jennifer
