"content": "portugal has joined greece and ireland on the casualty list of europe ' s sovereign debtors after its prime minister , jos\u00e9 s\u00f3crates , requested a european union bailout .     the dramatic decision came in the middle of a political crisis that has left the country in limbo and with spiralling interest rates on its debt .     \" i want to inform the portuguese that the government decided today to ask ... for financial help , to ensure financing for our country , for our financial system and for our economy , \" s\u00f3crates said in a televised address . \" this is an especially grave moment for our country , \" he added . \" things will only get worse if nothing ' s done . \"     s\u00f3crates said that the bailout , which analysts said could be between \u20ac 70bn ( \u00a3 61bn ) and \u20ac 80bn was \" the last resort \" .     the move was immediately welcomed in brussels . \" this is a responsible move by the portuguese government for the sake of economic stability in the country and in europe , \" the european commission ' s economic and monetary affairs commissioner , olli rehn , told reuters .     s\u00f3crates did not say how much aid portugal had asked for , but promised to negotiate the best possible conditions .     analysts said portugal was expected to need up to \u20ac 80bn , an amount the eu ' s bailout fund , the european financial stability facility , can easily cover . the european commission ' s president , jos\u00e9 manuel barroso , promised a swift response .     portugal ' s troubles differ from ireland , which pledged to cover huge losses at its banks , and greece , which lied about its debt . instead , it had allowed debt to mushroom during a decade in which its economy grew at just 0.7 % a year .     the yield or interest on portugal ' s 10-year bonds , which stood at 5.8 % a year ago , was at 8.54 % on wednesday .     economists had said that anything over 7 % was too high for portugal , which has growing unemployment and is predicted to enter a double-dip recession this year .     ratings agencies had downgraded portugal ' s bonds to a notch above junk level and even its own bankers warned they could not keep buying national debt as they tussled with liquidity problems of their own .     the caretaker government immediately blamed opposition parties for rejecting an austerity package on 23 march , bringing s\u00f3crates ' s socialist government down and forcing 5 june elections . it came on top of three earlier packages of cuts and tax hikes .     \" the country was irresponsibly pushed into a difficult situation in the financial markets , \" portugal ' s finance minister , fernando teixeira dos santos , told the jornal de neg\u00f3cios shortly before the announcement .     the call for help comes from a weak caretaker government which may hand over the reins of the country to a minority centre-right government led by the social democrats after the elections .     teixeira dos santos said that other political parties would have to fall into line with the bailout request . \" faced with a difficult situation that could have been avoided , i believe it is necessary to use the financial mechanisms that are available in europe within the terms of the current political situation , \" he said . \" that will need , as well , the involvement and compromise of the main political forces and institutions in the country . \"     social democrat leader pedro passos coelho said his party supported the aid request . \" this needs to be seen as the first step in not hiding the truth , \" he said .     the government had admitted earlier on wednesday that the political crisis was causing \" irreparable damage \" as borrowing costs rocketed .     portugal sold a billion euros in short-term debt yesterday but saw the yield on 6-month and 12-month bills hit spikes of over 5 % .     portugal admitted last week that the 2010 budget deficit had been 8.6 percent of gross domestic product , far above its 7.3 percent target .     the caretaker government still claimed this year ' s goal of 4.6 % would be met .     as portugal became the third eurozone domino to fall , attention was expected to switch to spain , though it has seen its debt yields improve recently as austerity measures bring down its deficit and growth returns .     international monetary fund boss dominique strauss-kahn told el pa\u00eds newspaper yesterday that spain - a far larger and more important economy - was safe from a bail-out .\n"}, {"url": "file://train/8/2/0", "title": "train/8/2/0",

five men were convicted on tuesday of murdering 2006 of investigative journalist and kremlin critic anna politkovskaya , including three defendants who had been acquitted in a previous trial .     politkovskaya ' s killing drew attention to the risks faced by russians who challenge the authorities and deepened western concerns for the rule of law under president vladimir putin , who was then serving his second term .     another jury ' s 2009 acquittal of three of the men who were found guilty of murder on tuesday embarrassed russian prosecutors and was later thrown out by the supreme court , which ordered a new trial .     the defendants were three chechen brothers , one of whom was accused of shooting politkovskaya in the lobby of her moscow apartment building on october 7 , 2006 , as well as their uncle and a former police officer .     the convictions are a victory for russian prosecutors and the state , but rights activists and relatives of politkovskaya say that justice will not be done until those who ordered her contract-style killing are identified and convicted .     \" the murder will only be solved when the name of the person who ordered it is known , \" a lawyer for politkovskaya ' s family , anna stavitskaya , was quoted as saying by ria news agency .     she welcomed the jury ' s verdict but said the men found guilty \" are only a few of the people who should be brought to justice \" , ria reported .     a spokesman for the federal investigative committee , vladimir markin , said the authorities were doing all they can to identify and track down the person behind the killing , russian news agencies reported .     kremlin critics say they doubt that will ever happen because of suspicions the trail could lead too close to the government .     politkovskaya , a reporter for novaya gazeta who was 48 when she was shot dead while returning home after shopping for groceries , was best known for her dogged reporting on human rights violations in the north caucasus province of chechnya .     lawyers for the defendants - rustam makhmudov , his brothers ibragim and dzhabrail , their uncle lom-ali gaitukayev , and former moscow police officer sergei khadzhikurbanov - said they would appeal .     investigators say gaitukayev organised the logistics of the killing while in jail for another matter , while khadzhikurbanov was in charge of preparing for the slaying and ibragim and dzhabrail makhmudov helped track her .     ibragim and dzhabrail makhmudov and khadzhikurbanov were previously acquitted .     the five men will be sentenced by a judge at a later date and could face life in prison . prosecutors will recommend sentences at a court session on wednesday , ria reported .

removes a cloud of uncertainty over the euro zone and has a good chance of ending the spread of debt market crises to fresh countries in the region .     investors had believed for months that a bailout for portugal was almost inevitable , so the announcement by caretaker prime minister jose socrates on wednesday is unlikely to hurt financial markets . the euro barely moved in the initial hours after the announcement .     the expected size of the bailout , 60-80 billion euros ( $ 86 billion - $ 115 billion ) according to a senior euro zone source , will not strain the euro zone ' s 440 billion euro bailout fund , especially since the international monetary fund is likely to be involved . based on past bailouts , it would contribute about a third of the amount .     many investors will see the request for aid as positive since it promises to avoid a worst-case scenario in which portugal would have limped along under a minority government until general elections scheduled for june 5 , refusing to seek help and digging an ever-bigger economic hole for itself .     this would have continued to push up portuguese bond yields and threatened a collapse of its finances that might have prompted markets to start attacking spain , widely seen as the next potential domino in the euro zone .     other governments in the zone have therefore been pressing portugal to request a bailout , and lisbon ' s willingness to comply -- despite its bad memories of imf-ordered austerity in the 1980s -- suggests the region remains able to summon enough political unity to address its debt problems .     \" this is good news . we ' ve been saying for a while that portugal ' s finances were not sustainable at these rates , \" erik nielsen , chief european economist at goldman sachs , told reuters . \" we think the contagion stops here . \"     spain     as recently as the turn of the year , it seemed likely that markets would target spain if portugal followed greece and ireland in seeking a bailout .     but the government of spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero has unveiled a series of reforms of the labor market , pensions and banking sector in past months . a stabilization of spanish bond spreads shows many investors now believe it can avoid the fate of its smaller neighbor .     portugal will have to agree to tough austerity targets to obtain a bailout , and how quickly a deal can be negotiated is unclear . socrates resigned abruptly last month after his latest package of austerity measures was voted down in parliament , and his caretaker government has said it lacks the authority to negotiate an economic adjustment program .     european union officials may also be loath to pursue an agreement before a new government emerges in the aftermath of the june 5 elections . in the case of ireland , the eu sealed a bailout deal with a lame duck administration only to face demands for changes from a new government in dublin .     however , now that it is requesting aid , portugal has much better prospects of obtaining some kind of bridging loan if that is necessary to tide it over until a full bailout deal .     and unlike ireland , where crumbling banks have been a black hole for state funds , and greece , which is struggling against ingrained tax evasion and corruption , portugal may be a relatively straightforward case for the eu and the imf .     the country already has an austerity plan in place which has received the blessing of eu governments and imf officials .     also , europe has learned lessons from the two previous bailouts . there is now a broad consensus in policymaking circles that the rescue terms for greece and ireland were too onerous , straining their economies and finances , so portugal can hope to get somewhat softer terms in some areas .     \" investors no longer seem to be worried about a full-blown euro zone crisis and the potential demise of the common currency because they assume mechanisms are now in place to prevent the crisis from escalating out of control , \" said jane caron , chief economic strategist at u.s. firm dwight asset management .     debt , bank risks     still , while a portuguese bailout may end the geographical spread of sovereign debt problems in the euro zone , it will not remove two big risks faced by the weakest countries : the possibility of sovereign debt restructurings , and the threat of deeper problems in the banking sector .     some senior government officials in the zone are now acknowledging for the first time in private that some form of debt restructuring for greece may be inevitable , even though officials publicly deny it will happen .     a number of economists believes the same fate may await ireland and portugal , although probably at a later date .     those fears are likely to keep market interest rates in all three countries very high for years , even if the countries do carry out the economic and fiscal reforms demanded by the eu and the imf .     joao leite , head of investment at banco carregosa in lisbon , said international aid would solve portugal ' s financing problems but that the country still faced a daunting task addressing its large deficits , competitiveness problems and weak growth .     \" unfortunately , the solutions to these problems will only have an impact over the longer term . until then the portuguese have a hard road ahead . \"     ( additional reporting by andrei khalip in lisbon ; editing by andrew torchia )\n"}, {"url": "file://train/8/2/2", "title":

fleeing the syrian civil war in mid-2014 . about 75,000 syrians have since been trapped in no-man \u2019 s land , unable to either enter jordan or return to syria .     aid groups managed to deliver food and supplies by lorry until june this year when jordan sealed the border to all traffic after a car bomb in the area . in the four months since , refugees at the \u201cberm \u201d \u2013 as the border fortifications are known \u2013 have been virtually without humanitarian aid .     without formal shelter , refugees had dug holes in the ground to escape a russian bombing raid . at the height of summer , when temperatures reached 50c ( 122f ) , m\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res ( msf ) said those at the berm were experiencing \u201csome of the most extreme conditions on earth \u201d .     but there was a glimmer of hope on monday when the jordanian government said aid could be delivered without opening the border \u2013 by using a crane to regularly lift supplies over the berm , or sandy ridge .     aid groups in jordan told the guardian nothing had been confirmed . but mohammed momani , a government spokesman , said in interviews with the jordan times and associated press ( ap ) that a plan had been set in motion .     \u201cthe new mechanism will be delivering aid on the berm through cranes , and the aid will be given to community leaders of groups of syrians so they can distribute it accordingly , \u201d he told ap . aid was previously delivered using a crane once in august .     if the plan goes ahead , the aid could alleviate a dire humanitarian situation on the border , where amnesty international says disease is rife owing to the absence of medical care since the start of summer .     several people have died of hepatitis , and satellite footage obtained by amnesty last month showed refugees had begun to create makeshift burial grounds in which to inter the corpses . \u201cmany people have died , \u201d one refugee at the border told the charity . \u201cthe humanitarian situation is very bad , the situation of children in particular is very bad . we have drinking water but hardly any food or milk \u2026 [ it ] is awful. \u201d     amnesty cautiously welcomed monday \u2019 s announcement , but warned that cranes were no substitute for allowing aid workers direct access to the 75,000 refugees .     khairunissa dhala , a refugee researcher for amnesty , said : \u201cnews that humanitarian assistance will be resumed to tens of thousands of refugees stranded at the berm comes as a welcome relief . however , amnesty international is extremely concerned about reports that aid will be delivered by crane rather than through a response that would allow for organisations to have unfettered humanitarian access to refugees at the berm who continue to live in inhumane conditions .         \u201cfurthermore , this short-term solution must not distract the jordanian government and the international community from finding a sustainable longer \u2013 term solution for the stranded refugees . jordan , must allow refugees at the berm into the country while carrying out necessary checks in line with international standards , to allay security concerns . world leaders must also relieve the pressure on host countries like jordan by assuming their fair share of responsibility and significantly increasing resettlement places offered. \u201d     the situation highlights the worsening prospects for displaced syrians hoping to reach safety outside their home country . in the early years of the syrian war , refugees could easily flee to neighbouring countries , with about 2.5 million escaping to turkey , 1.2 million to lebanon and more than 650,000 to jordan . syrian refugees now make up about a fifth of lebanon \u2019 s population and a 10th of jordan \u2019 s .         but as the war dragged on , middle eastern countries gradually shut their borders , particularly once it became clear that western countries would not share the responsibility by resettling significant numbers in europe and north america .     syrian refugees must now choose between living under regime rule ; fleeing to refugee camps in rebel territory , which have at times been overrun by jihadis or bombed by the government ; or risk being shot on the turkish border as they smuggle themselves across .\n"}],
