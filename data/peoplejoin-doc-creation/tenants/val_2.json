and brand identity , says in the complaint that she was hired by rony abovitz , the ceo by the dania beach , florida-based company to \" help with the pink/blue \" problem , referring to the lack of women in leadership positions at the company .     she also claims that magic leap had a culture that assumed its employees were men , including what she says was an internal email describing a policy for \" bored wives at home while you are loving it at the leap . \"     \" all the engineers and others in predominately-male magic leap could conceive of to make the product female friendly was to produce a version in pink , \" the lawsuit alleges .     according to campbell ' s complaint , many of the executives at magic leap blocked her efforts to reform company policy before she was fired in late december .     magic leap has raised $ 1.39 billion dollars in venture capital , valuing the company at $ 4.5 billion , from investors including andreessen horowitz , kleiner perkins , google , jpmorgan , fidelity and alibaba . the company promises to integrate computer graphics into the real world in a stunning way \u2014 a whale jumping out of a gym floor , for example .     but as

lawsuit describe the company ' s prototype as a \" belt pack . \"     advertisement     former employees also describe a company with sprawling operations . the lawsuit alleges that the startup has over 1000 employees .     magic leap did not immediately return requests for comment .     missed deadlines     campbell , who is suing for magic leap for sex discrimination , retaliation and hostile work environment , connects the lack of women in magic leap ' s leadership and engineering department with claims of missed internal deadlines .     from the complaint :     \" the macho bullying atmosphere at magic leap fosters a dysfunctional culture which creates chaos and lack of process and structure , hinders the company from achieving key product deadlines ( including launch , which has shifted back at least 4 times in campbell ' s 1.5 years at the company ) and , literally , prevented campbell from doing the job she was hired to do or achieving the goals she and abovitz had discussed during her initial interview : helping with the \" pink/blue problem \" or making magic leap less of a \" boys club. \" \"     advertisement     \" sadly , because magic leap seldom hires and does not actively recruit female candidates , the company loses competitive advantage to products like microsoft ' s hololens . microsoft , which employs far more females on its team , developed its similar product on a faster time line with more content that appeals to both genders . \"     one of the things campbell connects to her eventual firing was that she challenged magic leap ceo abovitz , comparing herself to the child in the \" emperor ' s new clothes \" who pointed out that the emperor was naked and not in fact wearing extremely cool invisible clothes .     from the

tannen campbell , magic leap ' s former vice president of strategic marketing and brand identity , filed the suit in a federal court in the southern district of florida .     the lawsuit alleged campbell was fired because the company ' s ceo , rony abovitz , refused to acknowledge the misogyny within the company and address a hostile work environment . the company is accused of violating the title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 , which prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex , race , color , national origin and religion . ultimately , these workplace problems , the lawsuit reads , \" renders it so dysfunctional it continues to delay the launch of a product that attracted billions of investment dollars . \"     founded in 2010 , the company is developing an augmented reality headset that superimposes virtual objects onto the real world , and has amassed $ 1.4 billion from the likes google and alibaba , despite no announced product for sale yet . late last year , an article by the information reported that investors poured money into the company after seeing impressive demonstrations of early prototypes , but the actual first commercial product will unlikely possess those same capabilities . and last week , a business insider article showed a widely-mocked image of what is reportedly a crude prototype of the device .     in the lawsuit , campbell said she brought up concerns that the company was showing off marketing material that didn ' t accurately reflect what magic leap ' s technology could actually do . the warnings were \" ignored in favor of her male colleagues \u2019 assertions that the images and videos presented on magic leap \u2019 s website and on youtube were ' aspirational , ' and not magic leap \u2019 s version of ' alternate facts , ' \" the lawsuit said in an apparent reference to u.s. president donald j. trump counselor kellyanne conway ' s infamous use of the term \" alternative facts . \"     campbell joined magic leap in april 2015 when there were no women in leadership positions , the lawsuit said . during campbell ' s initial interview at magic leap , she joked that the company ' s advertising department was a \" boys club , \" but abovitz told her he was looking to change that .     \" all the engineers and others in predominately-male magic leap could conceive of to make the product female friendly was to produce a version in pink , \" the lawsuit said .     the company ' s mostly male leadership team is made up of what the lawsuit described as \" abovitz sycophants . \" the one female leader , chief business officer rachna bhasin , is characterized as \" the perfect magic leap female employee : she went [ to ] harvard , never disagrees with abovitz and always does abovitz ' s bidding even when common sense or her own experience run counter . she makes the company appear diverse and inclusive although it is not . \"     in the first few months at magic leap , campbell said she tried to change things . she came up with a powerpoint presentation that outlined that only 14 % of overall magic leap employees were female and 3 % of engineering staff were female . she offered proposals to encourage more female inclusion in the short term , like recruiting from colleges with high numbers of female engineers , and in the long term , like tying bonuses to boosting diversity numbers . the lawsuit said abovitz kept putting off these meetings , or cutting them short when they happened .     eventually , abovitz put together the \" female brain trust initiative \" ( or fbi ) , headed up by bhasin , to make sure magic leap product design and content was developed with women in mind . the first meeting on may 18 , 2016 presented a prototype with the power supply implemented in a \" belt pack , \" and recommended not having the headset connect in the back of the head , to make it easier to wear for people with long hair or ponytails . the group make no inroads and none of the proposals made it into the design process . the group was pure \" window dressing , \" the lawsuit alleged . abovitz and other men didn ' t show up to later meetings .     the lawsuit said three or four core apps that the standard magic leap headset will end up shipping with included a game called \" dr. g , \" which had no lead female characters . the one female character is \" busty \" and depicted as groveling on her knees at the main character ' s feet . campbell complained repeatedly to the designers with no success about the game ' s misogyny , the complaint said .     sexist attitudes were abundant at the company , the lawsuit said . in one instance , campbell attended a conference call in september 2016 with several executives to talk with advertising agency r/ga . during the call , magic leap cfo scott henry said , \" i \u2019 m sitting here between two beautiful ladies . they \u2019 re not going to want to put a big ugly device over their pretty faces . and i have an office with glass doors , i don \u2019 t want people to see me with these beautiful girls with ugly things on their faces , \" the complaint alleged , referring to campbell and the company ' s head of operations , tina tuli . after the call , r/ga executives expressed concern about henry ' s remarks .     campbell , who joined as head of advertising , was made vice president only after she asked for the promotion in september 2016. campbell said in the lawsuit that this is an example of the company ' s leadership inability to make decisions .     \" abovitz was incapable of making decisions , \" the lawsuit said , \" but rather kept putting things off pending more meetings and assigning more people to solve the problem , which was one of the primary reasons magic leap could not bring its product to market . \"     after the the promotion , the complaint said campbell was marginalized in the leadership team . in her last four months , it said abovitz \" who always had been pouty and prone to temper-tantrums , began to dig his heels in even more in the face of dissenting ideas and to explode ever more frequently into child-like fits of rage

disinvited her from meetings . in november 2016 , abovitz told campbell to interview employees about their opinions of the company . she told abovitz magic leap should instead work towards branding
