( what \u2019 s unknown is how many hours of those days are spent stopped underground , waiting for a signal failure to be resolved , another train to move along , or for whatever bit of rubbish that has been thrown on the tracks at the station ahead of you to be cleared. )     7. the fastest trains travel at speeds of over 60 miles per hour .     the fastest line is the metropolitan , where trains can reach speeds of more than 60 miles per hour , but the average speed of a london underground train is only around 20.5 miles per hour .     8. the deepest station is nearly 200 feet below street level .     the deepest underground station is hampstead , on the northern line , which is located nearly 192 feet below street level . there \u2019 s an elevator , of course , but also an emergency spiral staircase featuring more than 320 steps , in case of emergency ( or a fit of exercise mania ) .     9. in 1969 , queen elizabeth took control of the victoria line .     in 1969 , queen elizabeth ii commemorated the opening of the victoria line by driving one of the new trains from green park to oxford circus . it was her second ride ever on a london underground train , the first being when she was 13 and accompanied by her sister and governess . presumably her stint as tube driver was without incident as eight years later , the queen was again allowed in the cab of a picadilly line train when she presided over the opening of the line \u2019 s extension .     10. the first escalator was a miserable failure .     the underground \u2019 s first real escalator was built in 1911 at earl \u2019 s court , but four years before that , a spiral escalator was installed at holloway road station . it didn \u2019 t last very long \u2014 in fact , it only lasted a day of testing and never actually saw public use . its remains are held at the london transport museum \u2019 s depot , which is only open to the public a few times per year .     11. the longest escalator is nearly 200 feet long .     the longest escalator at any underground station is the 197-foot-long moving stair at angel , in islington , on the northern line .     12. people have left a lot of weird things on the trains .     among the strangest things left on the underground and collected by the lost property office : a jar of bull semen ; outboard motor ; three dead bats in a container ; a vasectomy kit ; a harpoon gun , which may have gone with the 14-foot long boat ; a stuffed eagle ; breast implants ; false teeth and a surprising number of prosthetic limbs ; a four-foot tall mickey mouse ; six full-sized mannequins ; and an urn containing a dead man \u2019 s ashes , which was reunited with his brother five years after it was lost .     13. jerry springer was born at highgate station .     politician-turned-trash talk show host jerry springer was born at highgate station on the northern line on february 13 , 1944 , when his mother sought shelter during a luftwaffe raid during world war ii .     14. many people used tube stations are air raid shelters during world war ii , even though the government banned the practice .     speaking of air raids : at the start of the london blitz , germany \u2019 s nightly bombing raids on the british capital in september 1939 , the government banned people from using the tube stations as air raid shelters , claiming that the stations should be reserved only for transport . people got around the ban by simply buying a ticket and refusing to the leave the platform . a month later , the government realized that the ban was unenforceable at best and cruel at worst , and gave the go-ahead for stations to be used as shelters .     by the end of the war , sheltering in the underground had became so regular that a ticketing scheme was introduced to keep people from panicking at the queues , and more than 22,000 bunk beds were installed in stations across the system to provide places for them to sleep .     15. its iconic map was inspired by a circuit board .         istock     the london underground \u2019 s iconic map , which bears no relationship to actual topographical or geographical features , was designed in 1933 by harry beck . beck , an engineering draftsman who worked in the london underground \u2019 s signals office , was supposedly inspired by electronic circuit boards , and saw ways of tidying up the lines . but the department rejected the initial proposal , claiming it was too radical , and beck was paid a paltry less than $ 15 for his work . two years and some modifications later , however , the underground adopted the map and has used it ever since .\n"}, {"url": "file://val/28/1/1", "title": "val/28/1/1", "content": "starting in 1996 , alexa internet has been donating their crawl data

"researchers at arizona state university estimate that in a city of one million people , $ 13 million dollars worth of metals could be accumulating annually in sludge , the byproduct of treated sewage .     the study , which analyzed sludge from treatment centers in arizona and samples from across the country stored at the u.s. national biosolids repository , focused on 13 minerals with the highest value , including gold , silver , copper , and platinum . if every bit of the metals is retrieved , researchers reported there could be $ 280 per ton of sludge .     \u201cwhile we expected that the metals were present at low concentration , the fact that the small amounts represent such a significant economic value was definitely surprising , \u201d says pierre herckes , associate professor at asu and co-author of the study . of the $ 13 million , $ 2.6 million alone comes from gold and silver .         it \u2019 s possible that the metals found in sewage \u2014 which is basically anything that is flushed down a drain or toilet \u2014 is a result of discharge from jewelry and electronics manufacturing plants , mining , electroplating , and similar industries . after sewage is treated , 60 % of the remaining sludge is spread across fields , yards , and forests throughout the country as fertilizer , with the rest sent to landfills or incinerated .     the concentration of metals in sludge , however , could pose environmental risks , so finding a way to extract them would help mitigate the effects of the gold flush \u2014 err , rush .     in 2009 , a waste treatment facility in central japan managed to extract nearly 2 kilograms of gold from the ash of incinerated sludge , which was more than the amount pulled from japan \u2019 s hishikari mine , one of the world \u2019 s top gold mines .     however , no u.s. plants have started sifting through the goo just yet .     \u201ctechnically , it is possible to extract these metals , although it is very challenging , \u201d says herckes . currently , there is no technology we are aware of that can do it on a large scale without the use of enormous amounts of energy and harsh chemicals , he adds .     so don \u2019 t go digging out your old prospecting pan from the garage just yet . you \u2019 d have better luck scouring the streets of manhattan \u2019 s diamond district , where one urban prospector pulled in almost $ 1,000 in a week by collecting bits of gold and jewels off the ground .\n"}, {"url": "file://val/28/2/2", "title": "val/28/2/2", "content": "starting in 1996 , alexa internet has been donating their

notorious murderer     c                  the identity of jack the ripper may have finally been confirmed , new evidence suggests .     researchers now say that they have proven the authenticity of a much-disputed victorian diary supposedly written by the notorious murderer .     getty - contributor james maybrick , the cotton merchant suspected of being jack the ripper     previously , doubt had been cast on the legitimacy of a diary published 25 years ago by a cotton merchant from liverpool who was called james maybrick .     mike barrett , who made the diary public , also died before he could properly explain the origin of the memoir \u2013 which led many to believe that the diary could be a forgery .     however , a team of experts , led by film maker bruce robinson , now say that they have evidence to suggest that the diary is genuine and does indeed describe the infamous murders .     according to a new book , the diary was discovered in maybrick ' s former liverpool home - putting him back in the frame as the victorian serial killer .     james maybrick died in 1889 , a year after the whitechapel murders and , in 1992 , a team of electrical contractors renovated maybrick ' s former property , known as battlecrease house .     new evidence includes timesheets that prove workers were at the house on march 9 1992 \u2013 the same day that mike barrett told a london literary agent that he had jack the ripper ' s diary .     rex features the diary which experts now say they think proves jack the ripper ' s true identity     robert smith , who published the original diary in 1993 , told the telegraph that , because barrett had boasted about being an author when workers found the diary , the workers thought that he could help them sell it on to a publisher .     robert smith added : \" the truth was that barrett ' s only significant literary achievement was to write occasional puzzles for the weekly tv children ' s magazine , look-in .     \" barrett had a highly impetuous nature . just seeing or being told about the signature at the end of the diary would have been enough for him to reach for the phone .     \u201che was not very literate and the idea that he would have been capable of producing such a sophisticated and credible forgery is not remotely plausible. \u201d     most read in living great british buzz off we rate sex toys

later denied any involvement in the discovery \u2013 but none of their stories matched .     many critics resolved that the diary was a fabrication put together from news reports at the time , while others reckoned that only the real jack the ripper could have known the details the diary is said to reveal .     hulton archive - getty new evidence seems to confirm that liverpool cotton merchant , james maybrick was indeed jack the ripper     adamant that the diary is the real deal , smith said : \u201cthe new and indisputable evidence , that on march 9 1992 , the diary was removed from under the floorboards of the room that had been james maybrick ' s bedroom in 1889 , and offered later on the very same day to a london literary agent , overrides any other considerations regarding its authenticity .     \" it follows that james maybrick is its most likely author . was he jack the ripper ? he now has to be a prime suspect , but the disputes over the ripper ' s identity may well rage for another century at least \" .     a limited edition of 25 years of the diary of jack the ripper : the true facts by robert smith is available from www.mangobooks.co.uk from september 4 .\n"},
