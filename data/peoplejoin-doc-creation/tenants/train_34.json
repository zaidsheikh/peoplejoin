years , juan reinaldo sanchez served as a bodyguard to fidel castro . but when he became disillusioned with the cuban dictator \u2019 s hypocrisy and tried to retire in 1994 , castro had him thrown in prison . sanchez made 10 attempts to escape the island , finally making it to mexico by boat , then across the texas border in 2008. now he reveals all in his new book , \u201cthe double life of fidel castro. \u201d in this excerpt , sanchez explains how he lost faith in the revolution \u2014 and \u201cel jefe. \u201d     the end of 1988. a day like any other was coming to a close in havana . in a few minutes , my life would be overturned .     fidel had spent his afternoon reading and working in his office when he stuck his head through the door to the anteroom , where i was , to warn me that abrantes was about to arrive .     gen. jos\u00e9 abrantes , in his 50s , had been minister of the interior since 1985 after having been , notably , the commander in chief \u2019 s head of security for 20 years . utterly loyal , he was one of the people who saw el jefe daily .     while they met , i went to sit in my office , where the closed-circuit tv screens monitoring the garage , the elevator and the corridors were found , as well as the cupboard housing the three locks that turned on the recording mikes hidden in a false ceiling in fidel \u2019 s office .     a moment later , the comandante came back , opened the door again , and gave me this instruction : \u201cs\u00e1nchez , \u00a1 no grabes ! \u201d ( \u201cs\u00e1nchez , don \u2019 t record ! \u201d )     the interview seemed to go on forever . . . one hour went by , then two . and so , as much out of curiosity as to kill the time , i put on the listening headphones and turned key no . 1 to hear what was being said on the other side of the wall .     disillusioned     their conversation centered on a cuban lanchero ( someone who smuggles drugs by boat ) living in the united states , apparently conducting business with the government .     and what business ! very simply , a huge drug-trafficking transaction was being carried out at the highest echelons of the state .     abrantes asked for fidel \u2019 s authorization to bring this trafficker temporarily to cuba as he wanted to have a week \u2019 s vacation in his native land , accompanied by his parents , in santa mar\u00eda del mar \u2014 a beach situated about 12 miles east of havana where the water is turquoise and the sand as fine as flour . for this trip , explained abrantes , the lanchero would pay $ 75,000 \u2014 which , at a time of economic recession , wouldn \u2019 t go amiss . . . fidel was all for it .     but he expressed a concern : how could they ensure that the parents of the lanchero would keep the secret and not go and blab everywhere that they had spent a week near havana with their son , who was supposed to live in the united states ?     the minister had the solution : all they had to do was make them believe their son was a cuban intelligence officer who had infiltrated the united states and whose life would be gravely endangered if they did not keep his visit to cuba absolutely secret . \u201cvery well . . . \u201d concluded fidel , who gave his agreement .     it was as if the sky had fallen in on me .     i realized that the man for whom i had long sacrificed my life , the l\u00edder whom i worshipped like a god and who counted more in my eyes than my own family , was caught up in cocaine trafficking to such an extent that he was directing illegal operations like a real godfather .     the comandante , with his talent for dissimulation , went back to work as if nothing was amiss . one has to understand his logic . for him , drug trafficking was , above all , a weapon of revolutionary struggle more than a means of making money .     his reasoning was as follows : if the yanks were stupid enough to use drugs that came from colombia , not only was that not his problem \u2014 as long as it was not discovered , that is \u2014 but , in addition , it served his revolutionary objectives in the sense that it corrupted and destabilized american society . icing on the cake : it was a means of bringing in cash to finance subversion .     and so , as cocaine trafficking increased in latin america , the line between guerrilla war and trafficking drugs gradually blurred . what was true in colombia was just as true in cuba . for my part , i never managed to accept this twisted reasoning , in absolute contradiction to my revolutionary ethics .     sham trials     in 1986 , when economic aid from moscow was starting to dry up , castro founded the mc department ( for moneda covertible , or \u201ccovertible currency \u201d ) , which traded in goods \u2014 illegal and legal \u2014 for hard currency from third parties , principally panama .     the mc department soon acquired another nickname , the \u201cmarijuana and cocaine department. \u201d     but the americans became suspicious of cuba \u2019 s drug dealing , and scandal loomed . fidel decided to take action to nip any possible suspicion about him in the bud . he used the official daily paper , granma , to inform its readers that an inquiry had been opened .     among the arrested were the respected revolutionary general arnaldo ochoa and the minister i had overheard talking to castro , jos\u00e9 abrantes .     the machiavellian fidel , while declaring himself \u201cappalled \u201d by what he pretended to have discovered , claimed that \u201cthe most honest imaginable political and judicial process \u201d was under way .     obviously , the reality was completely different . comfortably installed in his brother ra\u00fal \u2019 s office , fidel castro and ra\u00fal followed the live proceedings of causa no . 1 and causa no . 2 on the closed-circuit tv screens . both trials were filmed \u2014 which is why one can today see large sections of it on youtube \u2014 and broadcast to every cuban home , though not live : the government wanted to be able to censor anything that might prove embarrassing .     fidel even had the means to alert the president of the court discreetly , via a warning light , whenever he thought a session should be interrupted .     and during breaks , the president of the court , the public prosecutor and the jury members would swarm out onto the fourth floor of the ministry to take their instructions from fidel , who , as usual , organized and ordered everything , absolutely everything .     the videotape     at the end of these parodies of justice , gen. ochoa was condemned to death . jos\u00e9 abrantes received a sentence of 20 years of imprisonment .     after just two years of detention in 1991 , he would suffer a fatal heart attack , despite his perfect state of health , in circumstances that were , to say the least , suspicious .     there followed the most painful episode of my career . fidel had asked that the execution of ochoa and the three other condemned men be filmed .     and so , two days later , on a saturday , a chauffeur arrived at the residence , where i was , to deliver a brown envelope containing a \u00adbetamax cassette video . castro \u2019 s wife , dalia , told fidel \u2019 s men they should watch it .     the video had no sound , which made the scenes we began to watch even more unreal . first , we saw vehicles arriving in a quarry at night , lit by projectors .     i have often been asked how ochoa faced death . the answer is clear and unambiguous : with \u00adexceptional dignity .     as he got out of the car , he walked straight . when one of his torturers proposed to put a band over his eyes , he shook his head in sign of refusal . and when he was facing the firing squad , he looked death square in the face .     despite the absence of sound , the whole excerpt shows his courage .     to his executioners , who could not be seen in the footage , he said something that one could not hear but which one could guess . his chest pushed out and his chin raised , he probably shouted something like , \u201cgo on , you don \u2019 t frighten me ! \u201d an instant later , he crumpled from beneath the bullets of seven gunmen .     castro made us watch it . that \u2019 s what the comandante was capable of to keep his power : not just of killing but also of humiliating and reducing to nothing men who had served him devotedly .     his brother \u2019 s keeper     after ochoa \u2019 s death , ra\u00fal castro plunged into the worst bout of alcoholism of his life . he had taken part in the assassination of his friend .     he turned to vodka , which had long been his favorite drink .     there was doubtless another factor involved : having watched the elimination of his counterpart , abrantes , ra\u00fal could logically fear that he , too , would be hounded from his position of defense minister .     the government no . 2 was dead drunk so often that the ministers and the generals could not have failed to miss it . the \u00adcomandante decided to go and lecture his younger brother .     i heard fidel admonishing his brother , launching into a long , moralistic tirade .     \u201chow can you descend so low ? you \u2019 re giving the worst possible example to your family and your escort , \u201d began the comandante . \u201cif what \u2019 s worrying you is that what happened to abrantes will happen to you , let me tell you that abrantes no es mi hermano [ is not my brother ] ! you and i have been united since we were children , for better and for worse . so , no , you are not going to experience abrantes \u2019 fate , unless . . . you persist with this deplorable behavior .     \u201clisten , i \u2019 m talking to you as a brother . swear to me that you will come out of this lamentable state and i promise you nothing will happen to you. \u201d     sure enough , shortly afterward , fidel spoke out in praise of ra\u00fal , applauding his integrity and his devotion to the revolution . ra\u00fal , for his part , carried on drinking vodka , but in far more reasonable quantities .     from \u201cthe double life of fidel

another fine gentleman named larry saw this very article and sent us his story about necco candy :     when i got my daisy red ryder bb gun in 1960 it was recommended by i think boy \u2019 s life magazine to use necco wafers as targets . we would suspend them on strings . the back stop was a heavy carpet hung in a \u201cj \u201d shape . it would catch the bb \u2019 s for reuse &amp; we also ate the broken pieces of necco wafers . in those days we wasted nothing , money was tight &amp; we had to earn it . i still have a fine collection of red ryders &amp; i watch the movie \u201ca christmas story \u201d every christmas &amp; still eat the occasional wafer .     but it \u2019 s not all love . necco wafers , in particular , are a divisive candy . sales figures don \u2019 t ( and can \u2019 t ) illustrate the dark side of sentiment . \u2026 though there are people who would probably negative-buy necco wafers if that were a possible thing . we have seen both sides of the passion .     we did a piece on the best and worst halloween candy where necco wafers ranked the #4 worst . we asked customers to give feedback to support their opinions either way . and necco wafers got by far the most written feedback . after digging through the results , we found the following comments :     necco wafers haters chime in i \u2019 d say they are like tums , but tums are f__ing better than necco wafers ! if you \u2019 re making chalkboard art , then by all means . otherwise , necco wafers suck all moisture out of my mouth and all joy out of my soul . we used to save them from halloween and use them in gingerbread houses at christmas time . all that time , never tempted to eat em . ick . necco wafers have to be #1 worst . the worst worst worst . chalky , creepy , child-molestor candy .     you can see there are two-sides to this coin . both are equally passionate .     if you are one of those who loves necco , what can you do ?     you might think , oh well , someone will buy the rights to make the popular ones and the necco wafers will live on . for sure . but will it be the same ? if they use new cooks , new machines , different water , maybe in a different climate . maybe the new owner will use cheaper ingredients or more expensive ingredients . odds are it won \u2019 t be exactly the same . and it could be very different .     we can \u2019 t risk it . there \u2019 s got to be a better option .     the best thing we can do is get the word out there . potential buyers of necco need to hear loud and clear how popular these products are . they need to hear from us how important it is to keep necco right where it is in revere , massachusetts . keep those factory workers employed and making that candy that we all love ( or love to hate )

dangerously self-destructive conduct and appears to be very ill , \u201d the eleven-page letter begins before recounting sheen \u2019 s outlandish public behavior from the past two weeks ( there

\u2018brilliant \u2019 performances during this time . not true . as outtakes of the filming show , mr. sheen had difficulty remembering his lines and hitting his marks . his conduct and condition created substantial tensions on the set . mr. sheen conceded in one or more of his numerous recent interviews that he sometimes showed up to work after not having slept and needed to move his mark to

sheen violated a morals clause     both sheen and singer have argued that there was no morals clause in the actor \u2019 s contract , but wb says that one section of the document allows the studio to refuse payment \u201cif producer in its reasonable but good faith opinion believes performer has committed an act which constitutes a felony offense involving moral turpitude under federal , state or
