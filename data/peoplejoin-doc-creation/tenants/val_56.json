( dec. 21 ) ap     blizzard warnings were in effect in iowa , wisconsin , minnesota and illinois , according to the national weather service . the weather channel reported that parts of 17 states are under winter weather advisories -- as far west as washington state and as far east as maine .     the storm brought much-needed precipitation for drought-plagued regions but was bad news for holiday travelers . most of the nation ' s big airlines responded to the storm ' s threat by enacting flexible rebooking policies for passengers scheduled to fly into the storm ' s path .     the storm led airlines to cancel about 1,000 flights ahead of the christmas holiday \u2014 relatively few compared to past big storms , though the number was climbing .     more than 600 flights were canceled at chicago ' s two airports , o ' hare and midway . o ' hare is a major hub for both united and american , meaning the disruption could ripple out and affect fliers at other airports .     more : storm snarls flights in chicago , midwest     southwest airlines , which canceled all of its flights out of its midway hub after 4 : 30 p.m. thursday , was anticipating normal operations friday morning in chicago .     united airlines also planned to operate a full schedule , though spokeswomen for both airlines cautioned travelers to check their flight status before heading to the airport .     american airlines cancelled flights scheduled to depart after 8 p.m. ct on thursday .     the snowstorm walloped iowa , where almost a foot of snow has fallen in des moines . state police said a 25-vehicle pileup killed at least two people , and across iowa 30,900 customers were without power thursday , including more than 25,000 in the des moines area .     the storm dropped as much as 13 inches of snow on portions of central iowa , paralyzed travel , knocked out power to scores of people and closed schools , government offices and businesses across the state .     \" it ' s just awful out there , \" capt . mike winter of the iowa state patrol said . \" people need to just stay home . \"     the storm made travel difficult from kansas to wisconsin , forcing road closures , including a 120-mile stretch of interstate 35 from ames , iowa through albert lea , minnesota .     most major roads across iowa remained closed either by official order or impassible due to snow and ice buildup late thursday .     the iowa state patrol said at least 88 crashes occurred on highways and interstate systems wednesday night through thursday afternoon . there were also at least 164 emergency calls from the public and 161 motorist assists .     on the southern edge of the storm system , tornadoes destroyed several homes in arkansas and peeled the roofs from buildings , toppled trucks and blew down oak trees and limbs alabama .     in southeastern wisconsin , where a blizzard warning was in effect , sheriff ' s officials said slick conditions led to at least two fatalities late wednesday when a driver lost control of his car in rock county , about 90 miles northwest of chicago .     the weather service was forecasting \" thundersnow \" in milwaukee and the surrounding areas , where snow could fall at the rate of 2-3 inches an hour .     wisconsin gov . scott walker issued an executive order declaring a state of emergency , which put the state emergency government , national guard , state patrol and other agencies on high alert .     at least two people in nebraska died in crashes blamed on poor driving conditions , the state patrol said . in many areas , drivers were being told to stay off the roads because of whiteout conditions . most of i-80 in the state was closed . nebraska ' s biggest school districts canceled classes , as did many districts across the region .     in utah , washington county sheriff ' s detective nate abbott says the woman and a man were driving when their car got stuck in rural washington county on tuesday night during the storm that hit the rocky mountain region .     he says the pair started walking for help , but the woman couldn ' t go any farther and sought shelter while the man continued on . search-and-rescue teams later found her body .     although the plains and midwest could do without the travel headaches , precipitation should be welcome .     more than 93 % of the high plains region and 54 % of the midwest are enduring drought conditions , according to thursday ' s u.s. drought monitor , a federal website that tracks drought .     out west , the leading edge of a powerful storm system arrived in washington , oregon and northern california . rain is expected across northern california from late thursday through the weekend , with heavy snow possible in the sierra nevada range as the system moves east .     four to seven feet of snow is forecast to fall above 7,000 feet , prompting the u.s. forest service to issue an avalanche warning for mount shasta .     contributing : ben mutzabaugh

conditions left many locales white less than a week before the holiday . many communities in central iowa , for instance , got about a foot of snow , and the city of madison , wisconsin , got 15.2 inches wednesday and thursday , according to the national weather service .     this much snow generally isn ' t expected as the system moves east , hitting ohio , pennsylvania and upstate new york . but that doesn ' t mean there haven ' t been -- and won ' t still be -- plenty of headaches .     snow is hardly foreign to these areas . but the addition of strong winds , especially in mountainous areas and along the great lakes , makes staying on snow-slickened roads even harder .     \" it ' s scary , \" esther boyer told cnn affiliate wdtn , soon after her car slid into a ditch friday in western ohio . \" i guess i was just driving too fast , and you should slow down a lot sooner . \"     the lone blizzard warning , in effect friday night through 6 p.m. saturday , was for parts of northern west virginia and north-central maryland . the national weather service predicts 8 to 12 inches of snow and sustained winds of up to 35 mph , with gusts blowing up to 60 mph .     \" strong winds will cause blowing and drifting of snow with blizzard conditions expected at times with visibilities of one quarter mile or less ( and ) wind chill temperatures in the single digits ... also

cleveland and erie , pennsylvania , were seeing snow around 9 p.m. friday -- are also expected to be hit hard .     the latter two cities are among those facing a winter storm warning through 7 p.m. saturday . the weather service ' s forecast calls for 5 to 7 inches of snow , with 10 inches possible in spots , plus regular winds approaching 30 mph and up to 45-mph gusts by lake erie .     a similar warning applies to western pennsylvania , where 5 to 9 inches of light to moderate snow -- some of it \" heavier , lake-enhanced snow \" -- and gusts as strong as 40 mph are expected .     even more snow , between 10 to 18 inches , is forecast farther south in pennsylvania and in northern maryland , with 50-mph gusts possible .     \" a winter storm warning means that snow will make travel dangerous , \" the weather service said . \" if you must venture out at all , use extreme caution . \"     these advisories follow severe weather farther west that caused major problems earlier this week .     while the city itself was largely spared of snow , chicago ' s two airports -- o ' hare and midway -- were clogged with travelers due to flight cancellations .     blinding snow is blamed for a 30-car pileup on interstate 35 near fort dodge , iowa , that killed two people , said iowa state patrol sgt . scott bright . it was one of close to 100 weather-related accidents reported

on his travels , science , philosophy and art . in china , the man who famously once described racism as \u201ca disease of white people \u201d describes the \u201cindustrious , filthy , obtuse people \u201d he observes . he notes how the \u201cchinese don \u2019 t sit on benches while eating but squat like europeans do when they relieve themselves out in the leafy woods . all this occurs quietly and demurely . even the children are spiritless and look obtuse. \u201d after earlier writing of the \u201cabundance of offspring \u201d and the \u201cfecundity \u201d of the chinese , he goes on to say : \u201cit would be a pity if these chinese supplant all other races . for the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary. \u201d     ze \u2019 ev rosenkranz , senior editor and assistant director of the einstein papers project at the california institute of technology , said : \u201ci think a lot of comments strike us as pretty unpleasant \u2013 what he says about the chinese in particular .     \u201cthey \u2019 re kind of in contrast to the public image of the great humanitarian icon . i think it \u2019 s quite a shock to read those and contrast them with his more public statements . they \u2019 re more off guard , he didn \u2019 t intend them for publication. \u201d     facebook twitter pinterest a page from einstein \u2019 s travel journals , written while in china in 1922. photograph : with permission of the albert einstein archives , the hebrew university of jerusalem and the morgan library &amp; museum     rosenkranz has edited and translated the travel diaries of albert einstein , which have just been published for the first time as a standalone volume by princeton university press , including facsimiles of the diary pages . the diaries have only previously been published in german as part of the 15-volume collected papers of albert einstein , with small supplementary translations into english . a spokesperson for princeton university press said : \u201cthis is the first time einstein \u2019 s travel diary will be made available to anyone who isn \u2019 t a serious einstein scholar. \u201d     further passages in the diaries , which are thought to have been written for einstein \u2019 s stepdaughters in berlin while he and his wife were travelling in asia , spain and palestine , and as an aide memoire , see him writing of the chinese that \u201ceven those reduced to working like horses never give the impression of conscious suffering . a peculiar herd-like nation [ \u2026 ] often more like automatons than people. \u201d he later adds , in rosenkranz \u2019 s words , \u201ca healthy dose of extreme misogyny \u201d to his xenophobia with the observation : \u201ci noticed how little difference there is between men and women ; i don \u2019 t understand what kind of fatal attraction chinese women possess which enthrals the corresponding men to such an extent that they are incapable of defending themselves against the formidable blessing of offspring \u201d .     in colombo in ceylon , einstein writes of how the locals \u201clive in great filth and considerable stench at ground level \u201d adding that they \u201cdo little , and need little . the simple economic cycle of life. \u201d     einstein \u2019 s perceptions of the japanese he meets are , in contrast , more positive : \u201cjapanese unostentatious , decent , altogether very appealing , \u201d he writes . \u201cpure souls as nowhere else among people . one has to love and admire this country. \u201d but rosenkranz points out that he also concludes that the \u201cintellectual needs of this nation seem to be weaker than their artistic ones \u2013 natural disposition ? \u201d     \u201ceinstein \u2019 s diary entries on the biological origin of the alleged intellectual inferiority of the japanese , chinese , and indians are definitely not understated and can be viewed as racist \u2013 in these instances , other peoples are portrayed as being biologically inferior , a clear hallmark of racism . the disquieting comment that the chinese may \u2018supplant all other races \u2019 is also most revealing in this regard , \u201d writes rosenkranz .     \u201chere , einstein perceives a foreign \u2018race \u2019 as a threat , which \u2026 is one of the characteristics of a racist ideology . yet the remark that must strike the modern reader as most offensive is his feigning not to understand how chinese men can find their women sufficiently attractive to have offspring with them . in light of these instances , we must conclude that einstein did make quite a few racist and dehumanising comments in the diary , some of which were extremely unpleasant. \u201d     rosenkranz told the guardian that although views like einstein \u2019 s were prevalent at the time , they were not universal . \u201cthat \u2019 s usually the reaction i get \u2013 \u2018we have to understand , he was of the zeitgeist , part of the time \u2019 \u2013 but i think i tried here and there to give a broader context . there were other views out there , more tolerant views , \u201d he said .     in his introduction , rosenkranz writes how it is important to explore how a humanist icon such as einstein \u2013 whose image was once used for a unhcr campaign with the slogan \u201ca bundle of belongings isn \u2019 t the only thing a refugee brings to his new country . einstein was a refugee \u201d \u2013 could have written xenophobic comments about the peoples he encountered .     \u201cthe answer to this question seems very relevant in today \u2019 s world , in which the hatred of the other is so rampant in so many places around the world , \u201d he writes . \u201cit seems that even einstein sometimes had a very hard time recognising himself in the face of the other. \u201d\n"}, {"url": "file://val/56/1/1", "title": "val/56/1/1", "content": "albert einstein is not just revered as the scientist behind the theory of
