"val/3/1/1", "content": "new york ( reuters health ) - stand-up comedians have long joked that some things , like the actual components of chicken nuggets , are better left mysterious .     recently , mississippi researchers found out why : two nuggets they examined consisted of 50 percent or less chicken muscle tissue , the breast or thigh meat that comes to mind when a customer thinks of \" chicken . \"     the nuggets came from two national fast food chains in jackson . the three researchers selected one nugget from each box , preserved , dissected and stained the nuggets , then looked at them under a microscope .     the first nugget was about half muscle , with the rest a mix of fat , blood vessels and nerves . close inspection revealed cells that line the skin and internal organs of the bird , the authors write in the american journal of medicine .     the second nugget was only 40 percent muscle , and the remainder was fat , cartilage and pieces of bone .     \" we all know white chicken meat to be one of the best sources of lean protein available and encourage our patients to eat it , \" lead author dr. richard d. deshazo of the university of mississippi medical center in jackson , said .     \" what has happened is that some companies have chosen to use an artificial mixture of chicken parts rather than low-fat chicken white meat , batter it up and fry it and still call it chicken , \" deshazo told reuters health .     \" it is really a chicken by-product high in calories , salt , sugar and fat that is a very unhealthy choice . even worse , it tastes great and kids love it and it is marketed to them . \"     the nuggets he examined would be okay to eat occasionally , but he worries that since they are cheap , convenient and taste good , kids eat them often . his own grandchildren \" beg \" for chicken nuggets all the time , and he compromises by making them at home by pan-frying chicken breasts with a small amount of oil , deshazo said .     \" chicken nuggets are an excellent source of protein , especially for kids who might be picky eaters , \" said ashley peterson , vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs for the national chicken council ( ncc ) , a non-profit trade group representing the u.s. chicken industry .     according to the ncc , its member producers and processors account for about 95 percent of the chicken produced in the u.s.     \" this study evaluates only two chicken nugget samples out of the billions of chicken nuggets that are made every year , \" peterson said . a sample size of two nuggets is simply too small to generalize to an entire category of food , she told reuters health .     two nuggets is a small sample size , deshazo acknowledged , and some chains have begun to use primarily white meat in their nuggets - just not the particular restaurants he visited .     \" chicken nuggets tend to have an elevated fat content because they are breaded and fried . but it ' s no secret what is in a chicken nugget - most quick service restaurants have nutritional information posted in the store or on their website , \" peterson said .     \" and every package of chicken nuggets in the grocery store by law contains an ingredient list and a complete nutritional profile , including fat content , \" she said .     the brief chicken nugget exploration was not meant to be an expos\u00e9 of the chicken industry or fast food generally , but to remind consumers that \" not everything that tastes good is good for you , \" deshazo said .     he and his colleagues chose not to reveal which chain restaurants they visited .     consumers aren ' t necessarily being misled , since much of the nutritional information they need is readily available , he said .     \" we just don ' t take the time to understand basic nutritional facts . \"     source : bit.ly/16inpg8 american journal of medicine , online september 13 , 2013 .\n"}, {"url": "file://val/3/2/1", "title": "val/3/2/1", "content":

through a fence to rescue two deputies from a gunman and pleaded with legislators to keep assault weapons off the street lest any more citizens get shot .     on tuesday afternoon , though , investigators from the same sheriff \u2019 s department he oversaw for nearly two decades found themselves monitoring a home near denver that mr. sullivan was seen entering .     soon after , the police arrested mr. sullivan , now 68 and long retired from the arapahoe county sheriff \u2019 s office , on charges that he had been trying to exchange methamphetamines for sex with a man . he was booked that night at a local county jail that proudly bears his name .     \u201cthe arapahoe county sheriff \u2019 s office is saddened , and this is a sad time for our community , \u201d said grayson robinson , the current sheriff , who served under mr. sullivan . \u201cbut we have a greater purpose , to serve our community with integrity and professionalism , and that \u2019 s exactly what we \u2019 ve done with this investigation. \u201d     photo     sheriff robinson said the police began an investigation into mr. sullivan \u2019 s activities on nov. 17 after several people informed the authorities that he might be involved with methamphetamines .     the investigation led the police to a home on tuesday where they say mr. sullivan had arranged to provide drugs to a man , a longtime associate , in exchange for sex . mr. sullivan was taken into custody without incident , sheriff robinson said .     according to a probable cause statement filed in court on wednesday morning , two confidential informers told the police that they had engaged in sexual activity with mr. sullivan before , in exchange for methamphetamines or cash .     word of the arrest shot through arapahoe county , a sprawling suburban area near denver , where mr. sullivan served as sheriff from 1984 to 2002.     \u201ci just cannot believe this happened , \u201d said robert r. gallagher jr. , a former district attorney for the 18th judicial district in colorado , which includes arapahoe county . \u201cthis is not the pat sullivan i served with and respected so much . something here doesn \u2019 t meet the eye. \u201d     steve ward , a former state senator and past arapahoe county commissioner , said he , too , was stunned by the news .     photo     \u201cit \u2019 s like waking up and reading a headline that says \u2018scientists have now determined the earth is flat , \u2019 \u201d he said . \u201cit \u2019 s incomprehensible. \u201d     mr. sullivan , whose dramatic rescue of his deputies in 1989 was captured on television , was named national sheriff of the year in 2001 and became a widely respected law enforcement figure here .     after the columbine high school shooting near littleton and his retirement , he became director of safety and security for the cherry creek school district , a position he held from 2002 to 2008.     \u201cwe are absolutely stunned at the news of mr. sullivan \u2019 s arrest and are fully cooperating with the arapahoe county sheriff \u2019 s office , \u201d mary chesley , the district \u2019 s superintendent , said in a statement .     mr. sullivan will face charges of \u201cunlawful distribution , manufacturing , dispensing or sale of a controlled substance , \u201d punishable by up to six years in prison . sheriff robinson said he anticipated that additional charges would be filed .     at an initial court appearance on wednesday , a judge raised mr. sullivan \u2019 s bond to half a million dollars from $ 250,000 at the urging of the local district attorney \u2019 s office . sheriff robinson said the request was made because of the nature of the accusations and the continuing investigation .     calls
