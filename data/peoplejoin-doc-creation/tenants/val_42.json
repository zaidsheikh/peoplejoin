( police also executed a search warrant at his home with the hopes of finding paul \u2019 s pants , shoes and cell phone. )     despite an intense and expensive investigation , rouschop has never been charged in the amy paul killing \u2014 nor has anyone else .     rouschop has maintained his innocence in all of this , and denies knowing amy paul , let alone killing her . he also says he didn \u2019 t choke or rape the two women now testifying against him .     gdimmock@postmedia.com     http://www.twitter.com/crimegarden\n"}], "eden": [{"url": "file://val/42/1/1", "title": "val/42/1/1", "content": "in the absence of a human host , bed bugs were twice as likely to aggregate on bags containing soiled clothes compared to bags containing clean clothes . contrary to our predictions , elevated co 2 did not affect this result . we did not observe bed bugs aggregating on the side of the room with the co 2 source , but instead found an increased likelihood of bed bugs leaving their refuge . our data are most consistent with the notion that elevated co 2 initiates host-seeking behaviour . this is similar to findings in aedes aegypti and anopheles gambiae where very small increases in co 2 concentration stimulate host-seeking behaviour19 , 20. the position of the co 2 source in a closed room above and away from the bed bug release point means directional cues as to the source of co 2 may have been difficult for bed bugs to discern and so it is not possible to conclude whether or not the lack of aggregation on that side of the room suggests a lack of attraction to co 2 . many commercial bed bug monitors use co 2 in conjunction with thermal and/or chemical cues , and claim higher catch rates than monitors without co 2 . our results suggest that any increase in capture rate in such devices10 , 21 might be caused by increased activity rather than , or in addition to , increased attractiveness .     the smallest bottle-neck through which a new bed bug population can pass , and therefore the most likely passive ( i.e . long-range ) dispersal phenotype , is a single mated adult female5 . there is some experimental evidence for a female \u2018disperser \u2019 : work using small arenas and shorter time scales found that females were more active than males22 and more likely to disperse from aggregations with a 1 : 1 sex ratio23 . by contrast , our study showed there was no significant sex difference in the number of insects found on bags with , or without , human smell ( table 1a ) . since dispersal from the refuge may be initiated by hunger , we would expect females ( with their higher metabolic rate24 ) to start host-seeking before males and potentially to do so more often . however , over longer periods , such as that used in this study , males and females are both likely to experience hunger and disperse from the refuge . our design does not enable us to resolve this issue .     our results do show that bags containing soiled clothes were significantly more attractive to bed bugs than identical bags containing clean clothes . human odour is a known cue for host-seeking bed bugs11 , but until now studies have focussed on how these cues determine the attractiveness of a sleeping host . our results show that bed bugs will move to , and aggregate on , soiled clothing in the absence of a host . bed bugs can sense 104 different volatiles16 found in the odorant profile of human skin25 . many of these volatiles are likely to evaporate from \u2018soiled \u2019 clothes for some time after they have been worn , removed and/or stored . we propose that residual human odour on soiled clothes acts as an elicitor of host-seeking or host-seeking-like behaviours , and that cues such as heat9 or elevated co 2 may facilitate the activation and sensitivity of such host-seeking behaviour . consequently , soiled clothing left in an open suitcase , or left on the floor , of an infested room is likely to attract bed bugs . when packed into the suitcase , they will accompany their host back home .     our results show that over a period of several days bed bugs are attracted to , and remain on , soiled clothing : this provides a biologically realistic mechanism that underpins passive , long-range dispersal in bed bugs . the advent of relatively frequent , short-stay holidays in locations long distances from the hosts \u2019 residence will facilitate the proposed mechanism of dispersal . careful management of holiday clothing may be an important strategy in the prevention of bringing home bed bugs .\n"}], "bhushan": [{"url": "file://val/42/0/1", "title": "val/42/0/1", "content": "the lawyer defending an alleged choker-rapist told a jury on thursday that jacques rouschop couldn \u2019 t physically have committed the vicious sex crimes he \u2019 s accused of because his hernia \u201cmakes it too painful to have sex from behind , his stomach is too large and his penis is way , way too small. \u201d     the first defence witness , a registered nurse , testified that she volunteered to take rouschop \u2019 s measurements . she testified that rouschop is five feet six inches tall , with a 66-inch waist , 31-inch thighs , and a one-inch penis , measuring approximately two inches when erect . the nurse also measured his umbilical hernia , saying it was 3.5 inches by 3.25 inches . ( there is no way of knowing his exact weight because the scales at the innes road jail only go up to 320 pounds. ) the court was also shown photographs of a naked rouschop , who sat in the prisoner \u2019 s dock statue-still as some jurors took notes about his most intimate measurements .     rouschop , a 44-year-old career thief , is on trial for the 2013 rape and choking of two vanier woman . both were sex trade workers and testified as crown witnesses , recalling horrifying accounts of being attacked and choked until they blacked out in the backseat of rouschop \u2019 s pickup truck in an unknown industrial lot .     rouschop has pleaded not guilty , and on thursday , his lawyer , natasha calvinho , launched his defence .     in her opening statements to the jury , calvinho was quick to acknowledge that rouschop has a criminal record that stretches four decades .     \u201che is far from a perfect man . he has made mistakes . he has committed crimes . he has spent time in jail and has a significant criminal record . he is known to local police and is someone who has been in and out of jail most of his adult life , \u201d calvinho told the jury .     she said that rouschop couldn \u2019 t have committed the crimes as described in court because of his physical limitations .     the lawyer then addressed the elephant in the room .     \u201cdue to his weight ( around 400 pounds at the time ) and his appearance , he will be the first to tell you that he has had a lot of trouble attracting members of the opposite sex , and that getting a woman \u2019 s attention , let alone having sex , was not something that happened very often for him .     \u201cdespite his lack of physical attractiveness , he still had needs \u2014 sexual needs . and he turned to the services of sex trade workers , \u201d calvinho said .     the defence lawyer tried to portray rouschop as more than a john , telling the jury that he cared about the vanier sex trade workers , drove them around , bought them groceries , and \u201chelped them anyway he could. \u201d     the lawyer said that in the case of one of the complainants , it went far beyond a money-for-sex relationship . \u201che cared for her . he brought her to his home for sleepovers and dinners with his mom , \u201d calvinho said .     the lawyer also told the jury that it is rouschop \u2019 s firm belief that ottawa detectives investigating the unsolved 2013 killing of sex trade worker amy paul targeted him because they suspected he killed her .     \u201che believes he is the subject of a witch hunt , \u201d calvinho told the jury .     the jury has heard that detectives working the paul case went to great lengths to successfully secure formal statements from the sex trade workers against rouschop . the charges \u2014 two counts of aggravated sexual assault and choking \u2014 that rouschop is on trial for now were yielded from the investigation into paul \u2019 s killing , which remains unsolved . ottawa police publicly linked rouschop to paul \u2019 s homicide in december 2013 but have never charged him . they also searched his home for paul \u2019 s shoes , pants and cell phone , according to records obtained by the citizen .     rouschop was charged with rape and choking less than 24 hours after ottawa police announced a $ 50,000 reward in the unsolved paul homicide investigation in december 2013. both women in this case testified that they didn \u2019 t initially want to come forward but did so after police strongly urged them to , court has heard . they also testified that they didn \u2019 t come forward because of the reward , which remains unclaimed .     gdimmock@postmedia.com     www.twitter.com/crimegarden\n"}, {"url": "file://val/42/1/0", "title":

not disease vectors , but i would rather not share my home with a roommate who wants to eat me , thank you very much .     scientists have noticed an expansion in bed bug cases across the world , in no small part due to increased international travel . but one team wanted to know how the bed bugs managed to hitch a ride , and how to prevent the spread . it turns out that part of the answer lies with the dirty laundry inside your travel bag .     advertisement     \u201cthere are a lot of good studies out there focused on trying to understand how bed bugs are attracted to humans and how they get around apartment blocks , but no one has really talked about how they get into the house in the first place , \u201d study author william hentley from the university of sheffield in the uk told gizmodo . \u201cstopping people from bringing bed bugs home can be a big step in preventing them spreading throughout the world. \u201d     scientists already know that human odor attracts bed bugs , though not which chemicals in the odor specifically . but for the newest study , researchers prepared a mock bedroom with laundry bags containing clean and dirty clothes \u2014 in other words , there were no humans in the room . the critters were \u201ctwice as likely to aggregate on bags containing soiled clothes compared to bags containing clean clothes , \u201d according to the paper published today in the journal scientific reports . contrary to the researchers \u2019 hypothesis , the amount of carbon dioxide in the room did not affect their results \u2014 the co2 source would represent a human , since some bugs like mosquitos are specifically attracted to the carbon dioxide you exhale .     these results were enough to convince the researchers that bed bugs could travel throughout the world by hitching a ride in luggage containing dirty clothes .     advertisement     as a caveat , this was an experimental room and not real life , said both hentley and toby fountain , an evolutionary biologist from the university of uppsala in sweden who was not involved in the study . but still , said fountain , the authors \u201cdemonstrate a striking pattern that bags containing clothes with human odor were more frequently used as refuges than those without . this result emphases the importance of making sure luggage and other belongings are made as inaccessible to bed bugs as possible when staying in increased risk places , for example by making sure bags are fully closed and secured and kept away from the bed. \u201d hentley agreed with this advice .     so there you have it . when traveling to possibly bed bug-contaminated locations \u2014 like , say , that sketchy-seeming hotel \u2014 keep your luggage on metal racks ( bed bugs don \u2019 t like crawling on metal , said hentley ) or put your whole suitcase in a plastic bag to avoid picking up the horrors that are bed bugs .
