who president donald trump tweeted friday would serve as acting chief of staff after john kelly departs in january , has been a loyal trump supporter \u2014 but he didn \u2019 t always like him so much .     during a debate with his then-congressional challenger , democrat fran person , on nov. 2 of 2016 , less than a week before trump was elected president , then-congressman mulvaney was blunt with those gathered at york middle school in york , south carolina .     after decrying the democratic nominee , former secretary of state hillary clinton , as a liberal who would take the country in the wrong direction , mulvaney said he was supporting trump , essentially by default .     \u201cyes , i am supporting donald trump , but i \u2019 m doing so despite the fact that i think he \u2019 s a terrible human being , \u201d he said , according to a report in the state newspaper .     mulvaney won his race by more than 20 points , with trump carrying the same area by 19 points .     a video of the debate remarks was obtained by the daily beast .     the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment .     mulvaney is far from the first person in the administration to openly criticize trump before signing on for a job in his administration , but he is certainly one of the most high-ranking .     during the 2016 republican presidential primary , trump opponent rick perry called the future president \u2019 s campaign a \u201ccancer on conservatism. \u201d perry now serves as president trump \u2019 s secretary of energy . before kellyanne conway became trump \u2019 s 2016 campaign manager during the homestretch of the race , conway had publicly criticized candidate trump for refusing to release his tax returns and for his \u201cvulgar \u201d rhetoric . conway currently serves as one of trump \u2019 s most ardent defenders and as his white house counselor .     even if mulvaney had never uttered a critical word about trump , the chances he would last long in a chief of staff post would have likely been slim regardless . two knowledgeable sources told the daily beast on friday that mulvaney has indicated in recent weeks that he definitely would not want the chief of staff position beyond a temporary , interim assignment .     \u201cwhy would he ? he ' s a sane man , \u201d one administration source said , bluntly , referencing the routine humiliation , reputational damage , and backstabbing that trump \u2019 s current and past chiefs of staff had famously experienced .\n"}, {"url": "file://train/6/1/2", "title": "train/6/1/2",

house mulvaney called trump a ' terrible human being ' ahead of 2016 election     mick mulvaney called then-candidate donald trump \u201ca terrible human being \u201d in a video from november 2016 that re-surfaced friday , hours after the president named him as acting white house chief of staff .     the remarks came one week before the presidential election during a debate between mulvaney , then a republican congressman from south carolina , and his democratic challenger at a middle school in york , south carolina , according to the daily beast , which first published the footage .     story continued below     asked if he was supporting his party \u2019 s candidate for the white house , mulvaney replied : \u201csure . if i have any chance to accomplish what the majority of the fifth district of south carolina sent me to washington to do , donald trump has to be president . period . that \u2019 s it. \u201d     revising america \u2019 s health care system , balancing the federal budget and other policy goals popular among his constituents could only be accomplished if former secretary of state hillary clinton was defeated on election day , mulvaney argued .     \u201cdo i like donald trump ? no , \u201d mulvaney said , insisting that the real estate mogul and reality tv showman was \u201cabsolutely not \u201d a role model for his two sons . but mulvaney also said that clinton was not a role model for his daughter , adding : \u201ci don \u2019 t like her very much , either. \u201d     \u201cwe have perhaps two of the most flawed human beings running for president in the history of the country , \u201d mulvaney said . \u201cso i have to step back and look and say , \u2018ok , what do y \u2019 all , the majority of the folks who vote for me , want me to do? \u2019 in order to accomplish that , i have to support donald trump , and he has to win. \u201d     mulvaney warned that clinton \u2019 s election would not be an extension of her husband \u2019 s time in office , but instead would amount to a third term for the more liberal agenda of former president barack obama . \u201cthat \u2019 s a four years we can \u2019 t take , \u201d he said .     \u201cyes , i \u2019 m supporting donald trump , \u201d mulvaney said . \u201ci \u2019 m doing so as enthusiastically as i can , given the fact that i think he \u2019 s a terrible human being . but the choice on the other side is just as bad. \u201d     trump , in a tweet friday , announced that mulvaney would take over as his top aide following white house chief of staff john kelly \u2019 s departure in january . mulvaney has served as the director of the administration \u2019 s office of management and budget since the outset of trump \u2019 s presidency .     \u201ci am pleased to announce that mick mulvaney , director of the office of management &amp; budget , will be named acting white house chief of staff , replacing general john kelly , who has served our country with distinction . mick has done an outstanding job while in the administration .... \u201d trump wrote online .     in another post , the president continued : \u201c .... i look forward to working with him in this new capacity as we continue to make america great again ! john will be staying until the end of the year . he is a great patriot and i want to personally thank him for his service ! \u201d     mulvaney , quoting trump \u2019 s message later friday evening , tweeted : \u201cthis is a tremendous honor . i look forward to working with the president and the entire team . it \u2019 s going

blood pressure and cholesterol and reduce stroke risk . but just as connoisseurs thought it couldn ' t get any better , there ' s this tasty new tidbit : researchers have found a way to make the treat even more nutritious -- and sweeter .     they will describe their research here today at the 249th national meeting &amp; exposition of the american chemical society ( acs ) , the world ' s largest scientific society . the meeting features nearly 11,000 reports on new advances in science and other topics . it is being held here through thursday .     cocoa undergoes several steps before it takes shape as a candy bar . workers cut down pods from cocoa trees , then split open the pods to remove the white or purple cocoa beans . they are fermented in banana-lined baskets for a few days and then set out to dry in the sun . roasting , the next step , brings out the flavor . but some of the healthful polyphenols ( antioxidants ) are lost during the roasting process , so the researchers wanted to figure out a way to retain as much of the polyphenols and good flavors as possible .     \" we decided to add a pod-storage step before the beans were even fermented to see whether that would have an effect on the polyphenol content , \" says emmanuel ohene afoakwa , ph.d. , who is at the university of ghana . \" this is not traditionally done , and this is what makes our research fundamentally different . it ' s also not known how roasting affects polyphenol content . \"     afoakwa ' s team divided 300 pods into four groups that were either not stored at all or stored for three , seven or 10 days before processing . this technique is called \" pulp preconditioning . \" after each storage period passed , fermentation and drying were done as usual . he reports that the seven-day storage resulted in the highest antioxidant activity after roasting .     to assess the effects of roasting , the researchers took samples from each of the storage groups and roasted them at the same temperature for different times . the current process is to roast the beans for 10-20 minutes at 248-266 degrees fahrenheit , he explains . afoakwa ' s team adjusted this to 45 minutes at 242 degrees fahrenheit and discovered that this slower roasting at a lower temperature increased the antioxidant activity compared to beans roasted with the conventional method .     in addition , the beans that were stored and then roasted for 45 minutes had more polyphenols and higher antioxidant activity than beans whose pods were not stored prior to fermentation , says afoakwa . he explains that pulp preconditioning likely allowed the sweet pulp surrounding the beans inside the pod to alter the biochemical and physical constituents of the beans before the fermentation . \" this aided the fermentation processes and enhanced antioxidant capacity of the beans , as well as the flavor , \" he says . he adds that the new technique would be particularly useful for countries in southeast asia and latin america where cocoa beans produce a chocolate with a less intense chocolate flavor and have reduced antioxidant activity .     looking to the future , he says the team will be studying in more detail the effects of roasting on the flavor of freshly picked compared to stored cocoa beans . they will be testing different temperatures and roasting and storing times to determine if even higher amounts of antioxidants can be retained through the process .     the researchers acknowledge funding from the belgium government under the vlir team cocoa project between ghent university , ghent , belgium , and the university of ghana , accra , ghana .     a press conference on this topic will be held tuesday , march 24 , at 11 a.m. mountain time in the colorado convention center .

 abstract     polyphenols are phytochemicals responsible for the astringency , bitterness , green flavours and antioxidant activities in cocoa ( theobroma cacao ) beans . these are degraded during fermentation , drying and roasting affecting the antioxidant activity of the beans . however , the extent of degradation of phenolics during roasting remains unknown . this work was aimed at investigating the changes in total polyphenols , anthocyanins , o-diphenols and antioxidant activity ( free-radical scavenging activities ) during roasting of pulp pre-conditioned and fermented cocoa . a 4\u00d74 full factorial design with the principal experimental factors as pod storage and roasting time were used . samples were analyzed for total polyphenols , o-diphenols , anthocyanins and antioxidant activity using standard analytical methods . variable decrease in total polyphenols , o-diphenols and anthocyanins were observed with increase in pod storage and roasting durations . however , variable trends were observed for the % free-radical scavenging activities . the total polyphenols , anthocyanins and o-diphenols in the cocoa beans after 45 minutes roasting decreased from 132.24 to 57.17 mg/g , 6.71 to 1.07 mg/kg and 15.94 to 8.25 mg/g respectively for 0 , 3 , 7 and 10 days pod storage treatments . the total polyphenols for the fermented , dried and unstored cocoa beans was 132.25 mg/g which reduced to 122.14 mg/g ( 7.642 % degradation ) , 116.721 mg/g ( 11.7 % degradation ) and 92.22 mg/g ( 30.3 % degradation ) for pod stored for 3 , 7 and 10 days respectively . increasing roasting time caused continuous decreases in the % free-radical scavenging activity from 89.10 % to 74.31 % after 45 minutes for the unstored pods . pulp pre-conditioning by pod storage and roasting duration could be used to reduce the astringency and bitterness caused by polyphenols , o-diphenols and anthocyanins in cocoa beans whilst increasing the antioxidant activity imparted by
