    al jean : i was just trying to think of a story and i thought , \u201cit would be a good father-son story if the rabbi passed away and the last thing he said to his son was , \u201ci think you \u2019 re eh. \u201d that the last word that krusty heard from his dad was \u201ceh , \u201d and that he had to try to reconcile himself with that , and try to find an answer for this lifetime relationship . i thought we did it in a way that i hope is touching but is real and is just the little ways that people make peace with their past \u2026 . then [ last fall , journalists ] were asking me on a phone conference what shows we had coming up and instead of just saying that , i thought it would be a little sneaky to say that the character had won an emmy and the next thing i knew it was a huge , worldwide story . so from that point on , we tried to tease it as best as possible but as you can see , there \u2019 s really about three clues you can give . it \u2019 s pretty obvious . what \u2019 s funny is at the [ television critics association summer press tour in july ] , we said , \u201cokay , we \u2019 ll make the title kind of easy and it should be really obvious , \u201d so i said , \u201cclown in the dumps. \u201d and then there were people going , \u201c( gasps ) you \u2019 re killing krusty? ? ? \u201d and i was like , \u201cwhat ? in the dumps doesn \u2019 t mean you \u2019 re dead . it means you \u2019 re sad. \u201d i thought it was so obvious . i would be nuts to kill krusty . everybody loves that character .     ew : what do you say to fans who might be disappointed that a bigger character didn \u2019 t die ? do you think the hype got away from you guys ?     jean : no , for three reasons . for about six months , i \u2019 ve been saying this is overhyped . people said it \u2019 s an iconic character [ who dies ] , but i never said it \u2019 s an iconic character . i never used those words .     ew : right . you said \u201cbeloved. \u201d     jean : he is beloved . jackie mason is wonderful . and he \u2019 s still with us . secondly , we \u2019 re not the kind of show that does these really horrific things to its characters . everybody loves these characters , and i would never kill krusty . i thought i was never even implying that . but people misinterpreted \u201cclown in the dumps , \u201d and then once i was tied into this craziness , i said , \u201cokay , i guess we should go with it. \u201d but the third thing is i think it just works as a sweet show , which is most important . it was something that would be a good exploration of the characters . i thought it \u2019 d be good to say , \u201cthis is what people think of heaven but it \u2019 s not exactly what you \u2019 re going to get \u2014 it \u2019 s more what you do on earth that matters. \u201d \u2026 . if you look back at the clues we gave , everything adds up , so i would find that satisfying . i wouldn \u2019 t feel like i was misled .     ew : could rabbi krustofski still return in flashbacks or dream sequences ?     jean : sure . we told the actor that didn \u2019 t mean the end of his part in the show . he certainly could come back as a memory of krusty .     ew : are there plans for that ?     jean : we haven \u2019 t recorded him yet , but it \u2019 s likely .     ew : how did jackie take the news ?     jean : our casting director , bonnie pietila , deals with the guest cast , so she called him and said , \u201cwell , we \u2019 re going to kill the character , but this doesn \u2019 t mean it \u2019 s the end of you being on the show. \u201d he \u2019 s great , and actually he \u2019 s a real rabbi too . [ mason was ordained as a rabbi before quitting to become a comedian. ] as a character , being a rabbi and exploring death is a good thing to do , and i think we dealt with different traditions of death \u2026 he was fine [ with it. ] he was happy to do it . he found out about it a week after it all broke . julie kavner [ who voices marge ] came up to me because she didn \u2019 t know , and she said \u201cwho \u2019 s going to die ? \u201d and i said , \u201cit \u2019 s krusty \u2019 s dad and the last thing he says is , \u2018krusty , you \u2019 re eh , \u2019 and she says \u201cthat \u2019 s a good story ! \u201d she might have been afraid that we were killing selma or something \u2014 she didn \u2019 t know. \u201d     ew : will we see a kinder , different krusty in subsequent episodes ?     jean : actually , yes . that \u2019 s one of the few changes that we would make is that he would actually be a little bit more of a generous person . he is who he is because he thought his father had never given him the respect that he wanted and actually [ his father ] did , so i think krusty will be a little more confident and a little more generous .     ew : the opening couch gag ? that was so crazy . my mind melted .     jean : that was all don . and it turns out that it looks a little bit like a reference to the fxx marathon , which i thought was cool . it \u2019 s definitely the most insane one we \u2019 ve ever done . and it \u2019 s got so many layers . i give him all the credit . what an amazing thing to start the show off with .     ew : did you just say to him , \u201cgo nuts and do whatever you want \u201d ?     jean : we had seen his work . he was recommended to us by our director mike anderson and he did that oscar-nominated short rejected . we knew this was the kind of thing he would do . he said he wanted to do the simpsons in the deep , deep future , so we had an inkling , but it was even crazier than we thought , which i thought was great . that guy \u2019 s really brilliant . i hope this exposes a lot of people to his work .\n"}], "farshid": [{"url": "file://train/4/2/1", "title": "train/4/2/1", "content": "focused crawls are collections of

\u2019 s had a tough relationship with his father \u2014 having krusty \u2019 s father die without him ever getting that warmth or connection he really wanted , then finally finding it in a surprising way , \u201d executive producer al jean explains to tvline . \u201cif we could get a sweet moment out of that , that \u2019 s all we wanted . we didn \u2019 t want a crazy death , or anything shocking , just true human emotion. \u201d     and even though the simpsons doesn \u2019 t serialize things too often , jean acknowledges that krusty \u2019 s father \u2019 s death is likely to have an impact on the character moving forward .     \u201cone of the reasons krusty \u2019 s been such a loose cannon is because his father disapproved of him , and he never felt like he got that sort of love that he wanted , \u201d jean says . \u201che might have a little more confidence now that he has that . \u2026 a little more. \u201d     related the simpsons ep on season premiere death : \u2018it \u2019 s

victim ? grade the episode below , then drop a comment with more of your thoughts .     \u2013\n"}, {"url": "file://train/4/2/3", "title": "train/4/2/3", "content": "it should come as no surprise that the much-ballyhooed decision to kill off an important character in springfield on the first episode of the 26th season turned out to be a lame play for attention by a show desperate to stay relevant . because the person who died was not homer , sideshow bob , grandpa or krusty the clown as some had guessed but \u2026 rabbi hyman krustofsky . who ?     it \u2019 s krusty \u2019 s father , voiced by comedian jackie mason . you may or may not remember him , since he made nine , mostly minor , appearances on the show . only four of those were voiced by mason and only one of which was in the show \u2019 s golden era in the \u2019 90s .     his death isn \u2019 t exactly an \u201citchy and scratchy \u201d bloodbath , either : after krusty suffers through a brutal comedy central-style roast ( featuring real-life roasters jeff ross and sarah silverman ) , he visits his father to get parental approval for his comedy . after telling krusty he finds his humor very \u201ceh , \u201d the rabbi dies , sitting at his desk .     and , boom , that \u2019 s it , he \u2019 s off to yellow heaven with bleeding gums murphy and maude flanders .     the episode tries desperately to milk this moment for some kind of emotional resonance with viewers , but the pathos udders are painfully dry . after the rabbi \u2019 s death , lisa becomes fraught with paranoia that her own father , with his non-stop donut and duff consumption , is in danger of dying .     but instead of pulling out a humorously poignant moment ( remember when homer \u2019 s mother had to run away in season 7 ? ) , the writers went slapstick , having her encase homer in bubblewrap in case he should get hit by a bus or something .     krusty spends most of the episode trying to reconcile with his father \u2019 s disappointment , and the climax \u2014 where krusty discovers a rabbi his father admired maybe stole some of krusty \u2019 s lame jokes , i guess ? \u2014 leaves you feeling kind of \u201ceh \u201d yourself .     it does lead to one of the episode \u2019 s actual funny moments , when he hallucinates jewish heaven , with a joe lieberman presidential library and \u201cfree egg cream \u201d day at ebbets field , where the brooklyn dodgers and new york giants are still playing . but compare this to the mortality gut check that lisa got when bleeding gums murphy died in season 6 , and krustofsky \u2019 s death seems like a pointless plea for attention .     the show \u2019 s writers opened with an oh-we \u2019 re-so-clever moment by having bart write on the chalkboard \u201cspoiler alert : unfortunately my dad doesn \u2019 t die. \u201d then it goes into a couch gag scene by oscar-nominated artist don hertzfeldt that is both overly long and perhaps one of the strangest in the show \u2019 s history , reimagining the simpson family as distorted microbial blobs from the future .     kelsey grammer makes a brief cameo as the murderous sideshow bob , but strangely , david hyde pierce , grammer \u2019 s co-star from \u201cfrasier \u201d who played sideshow bob \u2019 s brother in a classic episode from season 7 , also appears , though he \u2019 s playing himself .     no one expects much of a creativity payoff from this long-running sitcom , but even the 1999 death of maude flanders \u2014 a frequent but largely unremarkable presence on the show \u2014 felt like it was worth the build-up , as we watched ned flanders deal with life when it \u2019 s not so okely dokely .     so next time \u201cthe simpsons \u201d tries to get your attention by killing off a major character , you can simply shake your head and say , \u201ceh. \u201d\n"}], "cassie": [{"url": "file://train/4/2/2", "title": "train/4/2/2", "content": "no one from the immediate simpson family met
