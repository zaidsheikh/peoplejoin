were found about a mile from the family \u2019 s hunting camp , according to a statement posted on the \u201cfind ron and mary tarnowski \u201d facebook page that family members had started to aid the search . the camp is near u.s. highway 2 between brookston and floodwood , and a few miles from where the couple had been last seen , the country corner store .     \u201cthe family would like to thank the many men and women of law enforcement , the active and retired firefighters , the alzheimer \u2019 s association , and the overwhelming support of the community and the media for the diligent efforts this past week , \u201d the facebook statement read .     aircraft involved in the search had been grounded friday because of thunderstorms in the region , officials said , but returned to the air on saturday .     the news prompted an outpouring of condolences and support on social media for the tarnowski family \u2014 including the couple \u2019 s sons , kurt and karl , and karl \u2019 s wife bev \u2014 who had been tireless in recent days in organizing search efforts and checking on possible sightings .     ron , 82 , and mary , 78 , had been last seen july 29 at the country corner store along highway 2. ron was in the early stages of dementia , and mary suffered from right-side paralysis and had difficulty speaking . they lived in a home karl tarnowski built for his parents , adjacent to his own home in duluth . they generally spent most of their time at home , going out only for an occasional meal at nearby restaurants .     they weren \u2019 t carrying cellphones or credit cards when they went missing , and an onstar system in their vehicle was not activated , which left authorities with few clues to pinpoint a search over the past week .     \u201cwe ' re not looking for a needle in a haystack , because we haven ' t found the haystack yet , \u201d duluth police chief mike tusken said at a saturday morning gathering at the tarnowskis \u2019 home .     more than 100 volunteers , some wearing purple t-shirts and ribbons for alzheimer \u2019 s awareness , gathered in ron and mary \u2019 s driveway to begin another day of searching for the couple saturday . a photo of ron and mary was taped to their garage with a sign above it : \u201cmissing 8 days. \u201d     about 20 current and retired duluth firefighters were among the crowd of volunteers to search for one of their own . ron was a duluth firefighter for 31 years .     retired duluth firefighters jim reed and mark lavalier had already been out searching in the past week . lavalier worked with ron and lives one block south of the tarnowskis . trying to hold back tears on saturday morning , before the couple was found , he said , \u201cif it was me , i know that they \u2019 d be there for me. \u201d     reed didn \u2019 t know ron well , but said \u201cnobody deserves this , to be lost \u201d and to be confused with dementia .     law enforcement \u2019 s efforts to find the tarnowskis ramped up on saturday with a new emergency command center set up in pike lake and a new tip line with two dispatchers dedicated to the case .     during the saturday morning gathering , tusken said the police department \u2019 s violent crimes unit , which handles missing person cases , had been working on the case since day one and had tracked down dozens of leads in six counties and two states .     the police department decided to change tactics on friday night due to the expanding search for the couple , and the command center created a centralized location for the various agencies assisting in the search .     at the command center on saturday , before the tarnowskis were found , there was a steady stream of phone calls with tips and search updates .     law enforcement officials studied a gas station \u2019 s surveillance video , cross-referencing it with google maps and a tip to determine the likelihood that ron and mary \u2019 s vehicle might have been captured on the video .     on the wall , areas already searched were being marked on a large map of northeastern minnesota . authorities had notified fedex , ups and rural mail carriers to keep an eye out , and some student pilots had flown over the region to search while getting in their practice hours .     reed , the retired duluth firefighter who had gathered with dozens of other volunteers saturday morning at the tarnowskis \u2019 home , said at that time that the community response \u201cis a big circle . hopefully somebody will do it for us or one of our loved ones if it happened to them . that \u2019 s how we do it . we live in a society where we all got to help each other out. \u201d     andrew krueger of the news tribune staff contributed to this

the couple was married for 59 years . ( amber ferguson/the washington post )     ron and mary tarnowski spent their days confined almost entirely to their home in duluth , minn.     decades ago , at age 42 , mary tarnowski suffered from a stroke that left her paralyzed on the right side of her body , making it difficult for her to move or speak . her husband , ron , served as her caretaker for more than 35 years , assisting her with daily tasks and rarely leaving her side .     but in recent years , ron tarnowski , an air force veteran and retired captain for the local fire department , began showing signs of early-stage dementia , his son and police told the washington post . suddenly , the tough man with a \u201ccommanding presence , \u201d adventurous spirit and the build of a former football player needed to be taken care of , too .     getting around became even more difficult for the tarnowskis \u2014 mary , 78 , and ron , 81. the couple hardly ever left the home , which their son , karl tarnowski , built adjacent to his own so he could keep an eye on them .     occasionally , mary tarnowski would ask her husband to go for a drive , perhaps to nearby restaurants . but they never stayed away for very long and would always be back well before nightfall .     \u201cwhen the sun sets they \u2019 ve always been home , \u201d karl tarnowski , the younger of the couple \u2019 s two sons , said in an interview with the washington post .     so it was troubling when , on the evening of july 29 , karl tarnowski and his wife found the elderly couple \u2019 s home empty and their chevy tahoe gone .     mary and ron tarnowski had driven away that day without telling anyone . they left behind a cellphone , mary \u2019 s wheelchair and purse , and their medications . at 10 p.m. , their worried children called the police to report them missing .     for the next seven days , the family , law enforcement and hundreds of community members in duluth launched an extensive search effort that covered thousands of miles .     relatives and local authorities posted fliers all over the surrounding area and posted updates on a facebook group called \u201cfind ron and mary tarnowski , \u201d which was followed by more than 7,000 people across minnesota and the united states . retired duluth firefighters joined the search for one of their own .     duluth residents tied purple ribbons around trees and on businesses , in honor of the alzheimer \u2019 s association . they held news conferences outside the tarnowskis \u2019 home attended by the duluth police chief and about 100 community members .     relatives and police officials weighed several possible theories of where the couple could have gone . perhaps they had headed northwest to grand rapids , minn. , where their sons had been spending the day . maybe they were stopping by their family \u2019 s hunting shack , about 30 miles away from their duluth home .     on saturday afternoon , eight days after the couple went missing , the family received their answer , and a tragic end to their strenuous search . a u.s. border patrol helicopter found the couple \u2019 s chevy tahoe on an overgrown , abandoned driveway in a swampy area off the road just two miles away from the family \u2019 s hunting property . they were near brookston , a town about 30 miles from their duluth home .     mary \u2019 s tarnowski \u2019 s body was discovered inside the tahoe , and her husband \u2019 s body was found outside the vehicle , about 50 feet from the road .     authorities suspect ron tarnowski may have driven onto the trail accidentally before getting his car stuck in the mud , said lt. mike ceynowa , public information officer for the duluth police department . he said police think tarnowski left the vehicle to seek help .     autopsy results are pending , but karl tarnowski said there are signs that his mother died of a combination of dehydration and heat while sitting in the car on a day with temperatures in the upper 80s . there is also evidence that ron tarnowski had fallen down while trudging through the mud , his son said .     both are believed to have died july 29 , the day they went missing , the son said . no foul play is suspected , according to authorities .     \u201cit \u2019 s a horrific case , \u201d ceynowa said . \u201cnobody wants to lose their parents this way. \u201d     but in the parents \u2019 final moments , ceynowa said , ron tarnowski \u201cwas doing what he \u2019 s done for years : trying to help his wife and take care of her. \u201d     karl tarnowski does not know what prompted his parents to drive so far away , but he suspects his father \u2019 s dementia played a role . his father rarely visited the hunting cabin in recent years , and he never traveled there without one of his two sons . even then , he would be on edge , wanting to hurry home before sundown to take care of his wife .     the morning before they went missing , \u201ceverything seemed totally normal , \u201d karl tarnowski said . his wife gave his mother a bath and cooked the couple some breakfast . later that morning , he left town for the day , telling his father , \u201csee you later , papa. \u201d     \u201che said , \u2018take your time , but hurry back , ' \u201d tarnowski said . \u201che said , \u201cwe \u2019 ll be here anyway . we never go anywhere. \u201d     evidence uncovered during the course of the seven-day search revealed some details about the rest of their day . the couple stopped by a local wells fargo bank , where ron tarnowski withdrew an amount of cash typical for him . then they stopped at a restaurant for lunch , karl tarnowski said .     the map shows the distance from ron and mary tarnowski \u2019 s home to where their bodies were found . ( google maps )     at some point afterward , they headed northwest on highway 2 toward their hunting property . it was a \u201cbeautiful \u201d summer day , ceynowa said , \u201ca day we all hope for in the north. \u201d     a video from security cameras showed the couple in one of their final moments , walking through a bar and grill in brookston , minn. , possibly hours before their vehicle got stuck .     the surveillance footage captured the extent of the couple \u2019 s immobility . they could be seen slowly walking into the restaurant . ron tarnowski led the way , trudging along with his cane and holding his wife \u2019 s hand as she walked behind him , dragging a leg . it took 16 minutes for the couple to take a bathroom break , karl tarnowski said .     they had been married for 59 years .     lately , caring for his wife had became a taxing responsibility for ron tarnowski . and in recent years , his mental deterioration became a challenge for his wife , their son said .     but throughout these tribulations , karl tarnowski said , \u201ctheir love was outstanding for one another. \u201d     ron tarnowski joined the air force before graduating from high school and was stationed in the philippines for a long time , his son said . he actively volunteered with the knights of columbus , a catholic fraternal organization . as a father , he could be a \u201ckind of harsh person \u201d at times , but he had a \u201cheart of gold , \u201d karl tarnowski said .     his father often offered to work on welding projects for neighbors and friends , and would always say \u201cthis weld is guaranteed , \u201d tarnowski recounted . \u201cif it breaks , i \u2019 ll weld it again. \u201d     mary tarnowski was a \u201cbig-hearted \u201d mother who \u201cloved people \u201d and always looked forward to playing cards with friends . before her stroke , she volunteered with the census every 10 years , participated in her children \u2019 s parent-teacher associations and made sure everything in the home was organized . she never had a driver \u2019 s license , so her husband would frequently drive her around town .     \u201cthey went everywhere together , \u201d said mark lavalier , a retired firefighter who worked with ron tarnowski for several years and who assisted with the search efforts . \u201cyou \u2019 d never see one without the other. \u201d     the story of the missing couple resonated with families across the state , particularly those with elderly parents , lavalier said .     \u201ceverybody \u2019 s got parents . everybody watches them get old and realizes they become vulnerable , \u201d lavalier said . \u201cthat \u2019 s what people reacted to . this could be my parents . this could be everybody \u2019 s parents. \u201d     the story of the tarnowskis also underscored the dangers vulnerable adults can face when they leave home with no way of being reached or tracked . the onstar device on the chevy tahoe was not activated , and neither tarnowski was accustomed to carrying and using a cellphone .     karl tarnowski urged the importance of making sure vulnerable adults carry gps tracking devices or cellphones at all times .     \u201cif there \u2019 s any positive outcome to this , \u201d he said , it \u2019 s that , perhaps , \u201cit \u2019 s going to help somebody else find their parents someday. \u201d     more from morning mix     boy scouts \u2019 sailing lesson turns deadly when mast strikes power lines on texas lake     ted bradford was exonerated for a 1996 rape . why his attorneys still went looking for the real culprit .     after months of bullying , her parents say , a 12-year-old new jersey girl killed herself . they blame the school .\n"}], "dewei": [{"url": "file://test/23/2/0", "title": "test/23/2/0", "content": "duluth , minn. -

direction. \u201d     \u201cakai gurley did not deserve to die , \u201d he said , \u201cand the evidence of a kill shot that penetrated his chest and struck him in the heart suggests something more than a noncriminal accident. \u201d     a similar shooting occurred in january 2004 , when timothy stansbury jr. , 19 , was killed on a roof at the louis armstrong houses in brooklyn by officer richard s. neri jr. a grand jury declined to indict officer neri after he testified that he had unintentionally discharged his weapon after mr. stansbury pushed open a rooftop door , startling him .

college of criminal justice who directs its center on race , crime and justice , it seemed likely that a jury would consider criminally negligent homicide and reckless endangerment charges .     a central question for the grand jury to consider , professor jones-brown said , is \u201cwhat police are trained and authorized to do in these kinds of situations. \u201d if the police action goes against training and police guidelines , the next step would be to determine how much of the officer \u2019 s behavior had diverged from \u201cthe kind of care he should \u2019 ve been exercising ,

anonymity because he was not authorized to speak about an ongoing case . mr. liang may have used his phone to send a text message during that period , the source said , the daily news reported on

news suggested that officer liang was texting a representative of the patrolmen \u2019 s benevolent association , although a spokesman for the union said that account did \u201cnot appear to be true. \u201d nonetheless , one police official said , it was not unusual for an on-duty officer to seek guidance from a union representative after firing a gun .     mr. jeffries said that in the gurley case , he hoped a grand jury would vote for an indictment .     \u201cthat doesn \u2019 t necessarily mean a conviction , but it should mean an indictment that allows the facts to be aired in a public trial , \u201d he said . \u201cwhen unarmed black men are killed by police officers , we need public trials to help restore confidence in the criminal justice system. \u201d\n"}], "cassie": [{"url":

been indicted by a brooklyn grand jury .     officer peter liang has been charged with manslaughter in the second degree for his role in the nov. 20 shooting death of akai gurley , 28 , who was visiting his girlfriend inside 2724 linden boulevard when he was killed in a pitch-black stairwell , according to sources .     police commissioner bill bratton said liang ' s gun was \" accidentally discharged \" and called gurley a \" total innocent . \"     it wasn ' t immediately clear what charges liang faces . he is expected to turn himself in wednesday at 2 p.m. , sources said .     liang was conducting a vertical patrol with his gun drawn when he fired a single shot from a landing above the seventh floor , striking gurley in the chest , the nypd said .     \" this officer deserves the same due process afforded to anyone involved in the accidental death of another , \" patrolmen ' s benevolent association president pat lynch said . \" the fact the he was assigned to patrol one most dangerous housing projects in new york city must be considered among the circumstances of this tragic accident . \"     liang ' s lawyer decided not to allow him to testify before the grand jury , and sources speculated that decision was based on his inexperience and it would be wise to tell his story one time if he was indicted .     gurley \u2019 s girlfriend , melissa butler , 27 , told dnainfo

exterior patrols following a spate of shootings in the housing complex , so it was unclear why liang was performing a vertical patrol .     weeks later , gurley \u2019 s mother , sylvia palmer , said her son had been planning a surprise trip to visit her in florida for thanksgiving before he was killed .     \u201ci pray to god that i get justice for my son , \u201d she said . \u201cbecause my son
