cambridge analytica employees learned that its parent company , the scl group , was shuttering the business , with american-based workers directed to return their keycards immediately , according to documentation reviewed by gizmodo .     the news was announced during a conference call led by julian wheatland , the current chairman of the scl group who was reportedly tapped to take over as cambridge analytica \u2019 s next ceo . both cambridge analytica and scl elections ( the scl group subsidiary connected to cambridge analytica ) will now close their doors .     advertisement     during the call , wheatland said that the board determined that rebranding the company \u2019 s offerings in the current environment is \u201cfutile. \u201d     cambridge analytica and the scl group have offices in london , new york city , arlington , virginia , and washington , d.c. the conference call was originally scheduled for tuesday morning , but was repeatedly pushed back until early wednesday afternoon , ultimately getting rescheduled more than half a dozen times .     screenshots from the company \u2019 s internal chat service obtained by gizmodo show a darkly comic mood in anticipation of the call . one employee shared bleakly titled spotify playlists in slack featuring songs like \u201chigh and dry \u201d by radiohead , \u201cthe end \u201d by the doors , and \u201chelp ! \u201d by the beatles . another employee posted a still from titanic showing the ship \u2019 s band playing their instruments as the vessel sinks .     advertisement     in explaining the decision to close the offices , wheatland cited the ongoing investigations into cambridge analytica \u2019 s massive data harvesting scandal , damage to the company \u2019 s reputation , and loss of clients . in march , britain \u2019 s information commissioner announced that she was seeking a warrant to investigate any misconduct by the data analytics firm , looking to search both its offices

, the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company \u2019 s customers and suppliers , \u201d states the release . \u201cas a result , it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business , which left cambridge analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the company into administration. \u201d     update 4 : 56pm : asked for

city . donald blakeslee says he \u2019 s found it .     the discovery could put south-central kansas on the map as the second-biggest settlement of native americans found in the united states , blakeslee said . and it \u2019 s now , finally , the known location of a 1601 battle pitting outnumbered spaniards firing cannon into waves of attacking indian warriors .     be the first to know . no one covers what is happening in our community better than we do . and with a digital subscription , you ' ll never miss a local story . sign me up !     etzanoa has remained a mystery for 400 years . archaeologists could not find it . historians thought reports of a permanent settlement with 20,000 native americans in it were exaggerated .     but here in arkansas city , at the confluence of the walnut and arkansas rivers , blakeslee , an anthropologist and archaeologist at wichita state university , has found evidence of a massive town stretching across thousands of acres of bluffs and rich bottomland along two rivers . what clinched it was the discovery , by a high school kid , of a half-inch iron cannon ball .     he even found a still-functional water shrine , depicting communication with the spirit world , carved into a limestone boulder in tami and greg norwood \u2019 s backyard .     it \u2019 s a good story , all true , blakeslee said : a lost city , a forgotten mythology \u2014 and the story of the once-great wichita nation , decimated by european diseases , then pushed aside by american settlers and the united states army .     amazed by the size     with the discovery , arkansas city leaders are hoping to turn their town into a tourist destination .     \u201cwe always knew we once had a whole bunch of indians living around here , because we had found way too many artifacts to think otherwise , \u201d said jay warren , an arkansas city council member . \u201cbut we had no idea until dr. blakeslee came along about how big it was. \u201d     etzanoa might have been comparable in size to cahokia , blakeslee said . that alone should bring world attention .     the cahokia mounds state historic site in western illinois , with its pyramid monk \u2019 s mound , is the biggest native american urban complex ever built in the united states . it showcases the 14.4-acre mound that was the centerpiece of the ancient city , along with the outlines of the city , enclosed by fortress walls and filled with shrines of a powerful mythology and culture outside st. louis .     cahokia \u2014 the remnants of the largest pre-columbian settlement north of mexico \u2014 attracts 400,000 visitors a year , a fact that gets the attention of arkansas citians . if etzanoa was bigger , \u201cand it might have been , \u201d that will rewrite american history , blakeslee said .     \u201cthe spaniards were amazed by the size of etzanoa , \u201d blakeslee said . \u201cthey counted 2,000 houses that could hold 10 people each . they said it would take two or three days to walk through it all. \u201d     but for four centuries , the story of a big native american town in kansas made no sense to historians .     when french explorers came in the 1700s , 100 years after the spanish battle , they met only migratory bands of kanza , wichita , pawnee , kiowa , cheyenne and apache tribes .     so historians read the spanish accounts and raised questions : if there were a permanent mega-site named etzanoa , where was the huge accumulation of pottery shards ?     and where did those tens of thousands of people go ? twenty thousand , as the spaniards estimated in 1601 , is equivalent to modern-day derby , liberal or hays .     and how could plains hunters feed tens of thousands day after day ? bison are dangerous . the wichita had no horses and hunted on foot .     and where were the spanish cannonballs , fired by outnumbered and terrified spaniards ?     the battle     for years , blakeslee , 73 , had read the accounts of soldiers who served under the conquistador juan de onate , the founding governor of the colony of new mexico . onate \u2019 s soldiers said they fought a battle 60 years after coronado , somewhere in the great plains .     the battle reports said onate led 70 soldiers from new mexico and found a vast town at the junction of two rivers .     warriors on the outskirts threw dirt into the air as the spanish approached , signaling they were ready to fight . \u201cthe rayados , \u201d onate called the wichitas \u2014 \u201cthe striped ones , \u201d from the way they painted and tattooed their faces .     the spaniards entered the town , and the wichita fled , thousands evacuating to the north .     onate sent armed patrols into the empty town .     what his soldiers saw unnerved them . they told onate they \u2019 d counted 2,000 big beehive-shaped homes \u2014 clusters of these homes surrounded by cornfields . nervous about the size of the place , they turned around . indians told them later that the settlement extended for miles past where the spaniards stopped , meaning the true population might have been higher than the 20,000 spanish estimate .     onate turned his men south \u2014 and came face to face with hundreds of warriors , firing arrows and charging at onate \u2019 s small spanish troop .     the attackers were escanxaques , a tribe enemy to the wichita . they had come to attack etzanoa \u2014 and now attacked the spanish .     sixty of the 70 spaniards were wounded . their four cannons saved them , clusters of iron bullets fired from cannon-like shotgun blasts , whistling into trees and boulders . the escanxaques , stunned , regrouped in a rock-lined ravine , but then charged repeatedly uphill to attack before finally backing off .     cannonballs confirm     it was a high school kid , adam ziegler , who made the link that cinched the verification of etzanoa .     blakeslee says artifacts he and ziegler found in the past two years show the old stories were true , and that between the years 1450 and 1700 , at least 20,000 ancestors of today \u2019 s wichita nation thrived in and near what is now arkansas city .     blakeslee realized the confluence of the walnut and arkansas rivers could be the one described by the spanish . he found traces of houses and granaries . he \u2019 s walked over much of arkansas city and saw that the ravines and bluffs fit the spanish accounts .     after locals like hap mccleod told him people had been digging up \u201cliterally tons \u201d of flint tools and clay pottery shards for generations , blakeslee dug up his own shards , flint arrowheads , knife blades , hide-scrapers and awls .     two years ago he found a rock-lined ravine in mcleod \u2019 s backyard that matched the spanish account of where the escanxaques regrouped under fire to attack . he took a metal detector there , along with ziegler , a lawrence free-state high school freshman .     \u201cthey couldn \u2019 t find anything that day , \u201d ziegler recalled . \u201cdr . blakeslee said i could use his metal detector . an hour or two later , i found the little ball , buried four inches deep. \u201d     blakeslee found two more spanish cannonballs .     that did it , blakeslee said . the old story was true .     tough beyond belief     blakeslee says the wichita were wronged by fate , disease epidemics and war . he \u2019 s going to try to set right what he can .     smallpox and other illnesses killed probably tens of thousands after 1600 , he said .     war and relocation forced survivors to oklahoma reservations . the tribe lost most of its culture . the tribe \u2019 s last fluent speaker of the wichita language , doris mclemore , died last year .     the wichita were organized , cultured \u2014 \u201cand tough almost beyond belief , \u201d he said .     they and their wichita cousins in quivira , in rice county , built a trade network with ancestors of the pueblo indians in new mexico . they strapped 50-pound packages of dried meat and hides to themselves and their pack dogs , and walked 550 miles to the pueblos . they \u2019 d then walk back , bringing home cotton fabric , obsidian and turquoise .     they had no horses . the women and children likely helped hunt bison , blakeslee said , forming lines and waving hide blankets while driving bison toward warriors carrying bows and arrows . \u201cthink of the courage that took , \u201d blakeslee said .     they cultivated beans , maize ( corn ) , pumpkin and squash . they slaughtered bison meat and hides on an industrial scale . the men likely scouted , walking miles a day , shadowing herds . the women used flint hide-scrapers to thin down bison hides . \u201cfrom doing that all day , they probably had the toughest fists , \u201d blakeslee said . \u201cyou \u2019 d never want to get in a fistfight with a wichita woman. \u201d     intrigue , concern     modern-day wichitas number about 3,000 , based now in anadarko , okla. , said gary mcadams , who has held several leadership positions with the wichita and affiliated tribes .     the wichita are intrigued \u2014 and concerned \u2014 by what might come next , mcadams said . blakeslee has consulted with them for years , telling what he \u2019 s found , inviting them to visit sites at arkansas city and at the 160-foot-long serpent symbol still visible in the pasture grass in rice county . wichitas have helped on some of his digs .     \u201cwe would have some concern about how they go about developing their thinking about etzanoa as a tourist center , \u201d mcadams said . \u201cwe are supportive of any respectful endeavor they want to pursue there \u2014 but would want to provide our input. \u201d     jay warren , a city council member , says the town will explore development .     cahokia , in illinois , attracts 400,000 visitors a year , but mostly because of how striking the 100-foot-tall monk \u2019 s mound looks , and because it \u2019 s located next to st. louis and interstate 70.     arkansas city , in contrast , has pastureland .     but civil war battlefields don \u2019 t have a monk \u2019 s mound either , warren said . \u201cand yet they attract thousands of visitors by doing a great job with walking trails and signs that explain step-by-step what was going on. \u201d     if arkansas city with its 12,000 people could attract 20,000 students , archaeologists and tourists a year , it would give the city a boost , said mcleod , in whose backyard adam ziegler found that cannonball . mcleod now runs the etzanoa conservancy , and has worked for two years to polish ideas . \u201cwe \u2019 re really proud that all this history happened here , and we want to share it with the world , \u201d he said .     \u201cwe \u2019 re not talking about putting together a one-day wonder , \u201d warren said . \u201cwe \u2019 re looking at creating something that could be great for the region , and for 50 years and more down the road . we \u2019 re talking with ( unified school district ) 470 about how it could enhance education . and we think the site could also be a hands-on field training facility for archaeologists from all over the world. \u201d     they could build an interactive visitor center , he said . they could build reconstructions of the grass houses and granaries the wichita used . they could employ flint-knappers who could show how skilled craftsmen made arrowheads and knife blades .     etzanoa would have been beautiful , mcleod said . the river bluffs south of arkansas city look like picture postcards . the bluffs and hills pour out clear spring water from dells and nooks .     mcleod drove up recently to the tallest point in arkansas city \u2014 where the city \u2019 s golf course clubhouse sits .     blakeslee had told him that \u2019 s where caratax , the wichita chief in 1601 , probably kept his home .     \u201cyou can see 360 degrees in any direction from here , \u201d mcleod said .     \u201cand it \u2019 s all beautiful. \u201d\n"}], "eden": [{"url": "file://val/1/2/3", "title": "val/1/2/3", "content": "starting in 1996 , alexa internet has been donating their

there will be complaints from foreign leaders feeling slighted because the agency had not targeted them .     advertisement continue reading the main story     james r. clapper jr. , the director of

disclosures has opened the most extended debate on the agency \u2019 s mission since its creation in 1952. the scrutiny has ignited a crisis of purpose and legitimacy for the n.s.a. , the nation \u2019 s largest intelligence agency , and the white house has ordered a review of both its domestic and its foreign intelligence collection . while much of the focus has been on whether the agency violates americans \u2019 privacy , an issue under examination by congress and two review panels , the anger expressed around the world about american surveillance has prompted far broader questions .     if secrecy can no longer be taken for granted , when does the political risk of eavesdropping overseas outweigh its intelligence benefits ? should foreign citizens , many of whom now rely on american companies for email and internet services , have any privacy protections from the n.s.a. ? will the american internet giants \u2019 collaboration with the agency , voluntary or otherwise , damage them in international markets ? and are the agency \u2019 s clandestine efforts to weaken encryption making the internet less secure for everyone ?     advertisement continue reading the main

intercepts that cannot be read for lack of language skills ; and computers that \u2014 even at the n.s.a . \u2014 go haywire in all the usual ways .     mapping message trails     in may 2009 , analysts at the agency learned that iran \u2019 s supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , was to make a rare trip to kurdistan province in the country \u2019 s mountainous northwest . the agency immediately organized a high-tech espionage mission , part of a continuing project focused on ayatollah khamenei called operation dreadnought .     advertisement continue reading the main story     working closely with the national geospatial-intelligence agency , which handles satellite photography , as well as g.c.h.q. , the n.s.a . team studied the iranian leader \u2019 s entourage , its vehicles and its weaponry from satellites , and intercepted air traffic messages as planes and helicopters took off and landed .     they heard ayatollah khamenei \u2019 s aides fretting about finding a crane to load an ambulance and fire truck onto trucks for the journey . they listened as he addressed a crowd , segregated by gender , in a soccer field .     they studied iranian air defense radar stations and recorded the travelers \u2019 rich communications trail , including iranian satellite coordinates collected by an n.s.a . program called ghosthunter . the point was not so much to catch the iranian leader \u2019 s words , but to gather the data for blanket eavesdropping on iran in the event of a crisis .     advertisement continue reading the main story     this \u201ccommunications fingerprinting , \u201d as a document called it , is the key to what the n.s.a . does . it allows the agency \u2019 s computers to scan the stream of international communications and pluck out messages tied to the supreme leader . in a crisis \u2014 say , a showdown over iran \u2019 s nuclear program \u2014 the ability to tap into the communications of leaders , generals and scientists might give a crucial advantage .     advertisement continue reading the main story     on a more modest scale , the same kind of effort , what n.s.a . calls \u201csigint development , \u201d was captured in a document the agency obtained in 2009 from somalia \u2014 whether from a human source or an electronic break-in was not noted . it contained email addresses and other contact details for 117 selected customers of a mogadishu internet service , globalsom .     while most on the list were somali officials or citizens , presumably including some suspected of militancy , the document also included emails for a united nations political officer in mogadishu and a local representative for the charity world vision , among other international institutions . all , it appeared , were considered fair game for monitoring .     advertisement continue reading the main story     this huge investment in collection is driven by pressure from the agency \u2019 s \u201ccustomers , \u201d in government jargon , not only at the white house , pentagon , f.b.i . and c.i.a. , but also spread across the departments of state and energy , homeland security and commerce , and the united states trade representative .     photo     by many accounts , the agency provides more than half of the intelligence nuggets delivered to the white house early each morning in the president \u2019 s daily brief \u2014 a measure of success for american spies . ( one document boasts that listening in on nigerian state security had provided items for the briefing \u201cnearly two dozen \u201d times. ) in every international crisis , american policy makers look to the n.s.a . for inside information .     advertisement continue reading the main story     pressure to get everything     that creates intense pressure not to miss anything . when that is combined with an ample budget and near-invisibility to the public , the result is aggressive surveillance of the kind that has sometimes gotten the agency in trouble with the foreign intelligence surveillance court , a united states federal court that polices its programs for breaches of americans \u2019 privacy .     in the funding boom that followed the sept. 11 attacks , the agency expanded and decentralized far beyond its fort meade headquarters in maryland , building or expanding major facilities in georgia , texas , colorado , hawaii , alaska , washington state and utah . its officers also operate out of major overseas stations in england , australia , south korea and japan , at overseas military bases , and from locked rooms housing the special collection service inside american missions abroad .     the agency , using a combination of jawboning , stealth and legal force , has turned the nation \u2019 s internet and telecommunications companies into collection partners , installing filters in their facilities , serving them with court orders , building back doors into their software and acquiring keys to break their encryption .     advertisement continue reading the main story     but even that vast american-run web is only part of the story . for decades , the n.s.a . has shared eavesdropping duties with the rest of the so-called five eyes , the sigint agencies of britain , canada , australia and new zealand . more limited cooperation occurs with many more countries , including formal arrangements called nine eyes and 14 eyes and nacsi , an alliance of the agencies of 26 nato countries .     advertisement continue reading the main story     the extent of sigint sharing can be surprising : \u201cn.s.a . may pursue a relationship with vietnam , \u201d one 2009 g.c.h.q . document reported . but a recent g.c.h.q . training document suggests that not everything is shared , even between the united states and britain . \u201ceconomic well-being reporting , \u201d it says , referring to intelligence gathered to aid the british economy , \u201ccannot be shared with any foreign partner. \u201d     as at the school lunch table , decisions on who gets left out can cause hurt feelings : \u201cgermans were a little grumpy at not being invited to join the 9-eyes group , \u201d one 2009 document remarks . and in a delicate spy-versus-spy dance , sharing takes place even with governments that are themselves important n.s.a . targets , notably israel .     advertisement continue reading the main story     the documents describe collaboration with the israel sigint national unit , which gets raw n.s.a . eavesdropping material and provides it in return , but they also mention the agency \u2019 s tracking of \u201chigh priority israeli military targets , \u201d including drone aircraft and the black sparrow missile system .     newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you ' re not a robot by clicking the box . invalid email address . please re-enter . you must select a newsletter to subscribe to . sign up receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times ' s products and services . thank you for subscribing . an error has occurred . please try again later . view all new york times newsletters .     the alliances , and the need for stealth , can get complicated . at one highly valued overseas listening post , the very presence of american n.s.a . personnel violates a treaty agreed to by the agency \u2019 s foreign host . even though much of the eavesdropping is run remotely from n.s.a. \u2019 s base at fort gordon , ga. , americans who visit the site must pose as contractors , carry fake business cards and are warned : \u201cdon \u2019 t dress as typical americans . \"     \u201cknow your cover legend , \u201d a powerpoint security briefing admonishes the n.s.a . staff members headed to the overseas station , directing them to \u201csanitize personal effects , \u201d send no postcards home and buy no identifiably local souvenirs . ( \u201can option might be jewelry . most jewelry does not have any markings \u201d showing its place of origin. )     advertisement continue reading the main story     bypassing security     in the agency \u2019 s early years , its brainy staff members \u2014 it remains the largest employer of mathematicians in the country \u2014 played an important role in the development of the first computers , then largely a tool for code breaking .     photo     today , with personal computers , laptops , tablets and smartphones in most homes and government offices in the developed world , hacking has become the agency \u2019 s growth area .     advertisement continue reading the main story     some of mr. snowden \u2019 s documents describe the exploits of tailored access operations , the prim name for the n.s.a . division that breaks into computers around the world to steal the data inside , and sometimes to leave spy software behind . t.a.o . is increasingly important in part because it allows the agency to bypass encryption by capturing messages as they are written or read , when they are not encoded .     advertisement continue reading the main story     in baghdad , t.a.o . collected messages left in draft form in email accounts maintained by leaders of the islamic state of iraq , a militant group . under a program called spinaltap , the division \u2019 s hackers identified 24 unique internet protocol addresses identifying computers used by the lebanese militant group hezbollah , making it possible to snatch hezbollah messages from the flood of global communications sifted by the agency .     the n.s.a. \u2019 s elite transgression branch , created in 2009 to \u201cdiscover , understand , evaluate and exploit \u201d foreign hackers \u2019 work , quietly piggybacks on others \u2019 incursions into computers of interest , like thieves who follow other housebreakers around and go through the windows they have left ajar .     in one 2010 hacking operation code-named ironavenger , for instance , the n.s.a . spied simultaneously on an ally and an adversary . analysts spotted suspicious emails being sent to a government office of great intelligence interest in a hostile country and realized that an american ally was \u201cspear-phishing \u201d \u2014 sending official-looking emails that , when opened , planted malware that let hackers inside .     advertisement continue reading the main story     the americans silently followed the foreign hackers , collecting documents and passwords from computers in the hostile country , an elusive target . they got a look inside that government and simultaneously got a close-up look at the ally \u2019 s cyberskills , the kind of intelligence twofer that is the unit \u2019 s specialty .     in many other ways , advances in computer and communications technology have been a boon for the agency . n.s.a . analysts tracked the electronic trail left by a top leader of al qaeda in africa each time he stopped to use a computer on his travels . they correctly predicted his next stop , and the police were there to arrest him .     advertisement continue reading the main story     and at the big n.s.a . station at fort gordon , technicians developed an automated service called \u201cwhere \u2019 s my node ? \u201d that sent an email to an analyst every time a target overseas moved from one cell tower to another . without lifting a finger , an analyst could follow his quarry \u2019 s every move .     advertisement continue reading the main story     the limits of spying     the techniques described in the snowden documents can make the n.s.a . seem omniscient , and nowhere in the world is that impression stronger than in afghanistan . but the agency \u2019 s capabilities at the tactical level have not been nearly enough to produce clear-cut strategic success there , in the united states \u2019 longest war .     a single daily report from june 2011 from the n.s.a. \u2019 s station in kandahar , afghanistan , the heart of taliban country , illustrates the intensity of eavesdropping coverage , requiring 15 pages to describe a day \u2019 s work .     advertisement continue reading the main story     the agency listened while insurgents from the haqqani network mounted an attack on the hotel intercontinental in kabul , overhearing the attackers talking to their bosses in pakistan \u2019 s tribal area and recording events minute by minute . \u201cruhullah claimed he was on the third floor and had already inflicted one casualty , \u201d the report said in a typical entry . \u201che also indicated that hafiz was located on a different floor. \u201d     photo     n.s.a . officers listened as two afghan foreign ministry officials prepared for a meeting between president hamid karzai of afghanistan and iranian officials , assuring them that relations with the united states \u201cwould in no way threaten the interests of iran , \u201d which they decided mr. karzai should describe as a \u201cbrotherly country. \u201d     the n.s.a . eavesdropped as the top united nations official in afghanistan , staffan de mistura , consulted his european union counterpart , vygaudas usackas , about how to respond to an afghan court \u2019 s decision to overturn the election of 62 members of parliament .     advertisement continue reading the main story     and the agency was a fly on the wall for a long-running land dispute between the mayor of kandahar and a prominent local man known as the keeper of the cloak of the prophet muhammad , with president karzai \u2019 s late brother , ahmed wali karzai , as a mediator .     the agency discovered a taliban claim to have killed five police officers at a checkpoint by giving them poisoned yogurt , and heard a provincial governor tell an aide that a district police chief was verbally abusing women and clergymen .     advertisement continue reading the main story     a taliban figure , mullah rahimullah akhund , known on the united states military \u2019 s kill-or-capture list by the code name objective squiz incinerator , was overheard instructing an associate to buy suicide vests and a japanese motorbike , according to the documents .     and n.s.a . listened in as a saudi extremist , abu mughira , called his mother to report that he and his fellow fighters had entered afghanistan and \u201cdone victorious operations. \u201d     such reports flowed from the agency \u2019 s kandahar station day after day , year after year , and surely strengthened the american campaign against the taliban . but they also suggest the limits of intelligence against a complex political and military challenge . the n.s.a . recorded the hotel attack , but it had not prevented it . it tracked mr. karzai \u2019 s government , but he remained a difficult and volatile partner . its surveillance was crucial in the capture or killing of many enemy fighters , but not nearly enough to remove the taliban \u2019 s ominous shadow from afghanistan \u2019 s future .     advertisement continue reading the main story     mining all the tidbits     in the afghan reports and many others , a striking paradox is the odd intimacy of a sprawling , technology-driven agency with its targets . it is the one-way intimacy of the eavesdropper , as n.s.a . employees virtually enter the office cubicles of obscure government officials and the spartan hide-outs of drug traffickers and militants around the world .     advertisement continue reading the main story     venezuela , for instance , was one of six \u201cenduring targets \u201d in n.s.a. \u2019 s official mission list from 2007 , along with china , north korea , iraq , iran and russia . the united states viewed itself in a contest for influence in latin america with venezuela \u2019 s leader then , the leftist firebrand hugo ch\u00e1vez , who allied himself with cuba , and one agency goal was \u201cpreventing venezuela from achieving its regional leadership objectives and pursuing policies that negatively impact u.s. global interests. \u201d     a glimpse of what this meant in practice comes in a brief powerpoint presentation from august 2010 on \u201cdevelopment of the venezuelan economic mission. \u201d the n.s.a . was tracking billions of dollars flowing to caracas in loans from china ( radar systems and oil drilling ) , russia ( mig fighter planes and shoulder-fired missiles ) and iran ( a factory to manufacture drone aircraft ) .     advertisement continue reading the main story     but it was also getting up-close and personal with venezuela \u2019 s ministry of planning and finance , monitoring the government and personal emails of the top 10 venezuelan economic officials . an n.s.a . officer in texas , in other words , was paid each day to peruse the private messages of obscure venezuelan bureaucrats , hunting for tidbits that might offer some tiny policy edge .     photo     in a counterdrug operation in late 2011 , the agency \u2019 s officers seemed to know more about relations within a sprawling narcotics network than the drug dealers themselves . they listened to \u201cricketts , \u201d a jamaican drug supplier based in ecuador , struggling to keep his cocaine and marijuana smuggling business going after an associate , \u201cgordo , \u201d claimed he had paid $ 250,000 and received nothing in return .     advertisement continue reading the main story     the n.s.a. , a report said , was on top of not just their cellphones , but also those of the whole network of \u201cbuyers , transporters , suppliers , and middlemen \u201d stretching from the netherlands and nova scotia to panama city and bogot\u00e1 , colombia . the documents do not say whether arrests resulted from all that eavesdropping .     even with terrorists , n.s.a . units can form a strangely personal relationship . the n.s.a.-g.c.h.q . wiki , a top secret group blog that mr. snowden downloaded , lists 14 specialists scattered in various stations assigned to lashkar-e-taiba , the pakistani terrorist group that carried out the bloody attack on mumbai in 2008 , with titles including \u201cpakistan access pursuit team \u201d and \u201ctechniques discovery branch. \u201d under the code name treaclebeta , n.s.a. \u2019 s hackers at tailored access operations also played a role .     advertisement continue reading the main story     in the wiki \u2019 s casual atmosphere , american and british eavesdroppers exchange the peculiar shoptalk of the secret world . \u201ci don \u2019 t normally use heretic to scan the fax traffic , i use nucleon , \u201d one user writes , describing technical tools for searching intercepted documents .     advertisement continue reading the main story     but most striking are the one-on-one pairings of spies and militants ; bryan is assigned to listen in on a man named haroon , and paul keeps an ear on fazl .     a flood of details     one n.s.a . officer on the lashkar-e-taiba beat let slip that some of his eavesdropping turned out to be largely pointless , perhaps because of the agency \u2019 s chronic shortage of skilled linguists . he \u201cran some queries \u201d to read intercepted communications of certain lashkar-e-taiba members , he wrote in the wiki , but added : \u201cmost of it is in arabic or farsi , so i can \u2019 t make much of it. \u201d     it is a glimpse of the unsurprising fact that sometimes the agency \u2019 s expensive and expansive efforts accomplish little . despite the agency \u2019 s embrace of corporate jargon on goal-setting and evaluation , it operates without public oversight in an arena in which achievements are hard to measure .     advertisement continue reading the main story     in a world of ballooning communications , the agency is sometimes simply overwhelmed . in 2008 , the n.s.a. \u2019 s middle east and north africa group set about updating its sigint collection capabilities . the \u201cambitious scrub \u201d of selectors \u2014 essentially search terms \u2014 cut the number of terms automatically searched from 21,177 to 7,795 and the number of messages added to the agency \u2019 s pinwale database from 850,000 a day to 450,000 a day .     the reduction in volume was treated as a major achievement , opening the way for new collection on iranian leadership and saudi and syrian diplomats , the report said .     advertisement continue reading the main story     and in a note that may comfort computer novices , the n.s.a . middle east analysts discovered major glitches in their search software : the computer was searching for the names of targets but not their email addresses , a rather fundamental flaw . \u201cover 500 messages in one week did not come in , \u201d the report said about one target .     those are daily course corrections . whether the snowden disclosures will result in deeper change is uncertain . joel f. brenner , the agency \u2019 s former inspector general , says much of the criticism is unfair , reflecting a na\u00efvet\u00e9 about the realpolitik of spying . \u201cthe agency is being browbeaten for doing too well the things it \u2019 s supposed to do , \u201d he said .     but mr. brenner added that he believes \u201ctechnology has outrun policy \u201d at the n.s.a. , and that in an era in which spying may well be exposed , \u201croutine targeting of close allies is bad politics and is foolish. \u201d     another former insider worries less about foreign leaders \u2019 sensitivities than the potential danger the sprawling agency poses at home . william e. binney , a former senior n.s.a . official who has become an outspoken critic , says he has no problem with spying on foreign targets like brazil \u2019 s president or the german chancellor , angela merkel . \u201cthat \u2019 s pretty much what every government does , \u201d he said . \u201cit \u2019 s the foundation of diplomacy. \u201d but mr. binney said that without new leadership , new laws and top-to-bottom reform , the agency will represent a threat of \u201cturnkey totalitarianism \u201d \u2014 the capability to turn its awesome power , now directed mainly against other countries , on the american public .     advertisement continue reading the main story     \u201ci think it \u2019 s already starting to happen , \u201d he said . \u201cthat \u2019 s what we have to stop. \u201d     whatever reforms may come , bobby r. inman , who weathered his own turbulent period as n.s.a . director from 1977 to 1981 , offers his hyper-secret former agency a radical suggestion for right now . \u201cmy advice would be to take everything you think snowden has and get it out yourself , \u201d he said . \u201cit would certainly be a shock to the agency . but bad news doesn \u2019 t get better with age . the sooner they get it out and put it behind them , the faster they can begin to rebuild. \u201d\n"}, {"url":
