"train/36/2/1", "content": "ottawa -- the senate has voted to pass bill c-45 , the government \u2019 s legislation to legalize cannabis , meaning that recreational marijuana will soon be legal across canada .     some parliamentarians are calling it an \" historic \" moment in this country , while others are warning of the work left to be done : raising public awareness about the implications of this incoming major social policy change .     after more than a year of intensive study in both the house and senate , the bill cleared the final legislative hurdle tuesday evening , passing by a vote of 52 to 29 with two abstentions from the independent senators from quebec : sen. marie-fran\u00e7oise m\u00e9gie and sen. rosa galvez .     the vote was on a motion from sen. peter harder , the government representative in the senate , to accept the government \u2019 s position on the senate ' s amendments and pass the bill as is . it was all that was left in a short round of legislative ping-pong spurred by the upper chamber amending the government legislation .     the house of commons will be notified of the senate ' s decision . after that , all that is left will be royal assent to officially pass the bill and for the government to determine when the new law will come into force .     leader of the independent senators group sen. yuen pau woo told reporters after the vote that the mammoth study of bill c-45 was \u201ca bit of a stress test \u201d for the increasingly independent senate .     he said now , the work will have to begin on implementing the legislation , and making sure canadians understand what this new regime means .     \" we are now moving where in the legalized industry we have the chance to push out the illicit elements , we have the chance to do research on cannabis , we have the chance to properly educate our young people on the harms of cannabis use , and all of this should be the focus of the whole country now , \" sen. woo said .     the legislation -- an electoral promise of prime minister justin trudeau and the liberal party -- allows adults in canada to legally possess and use small amounts of recreational cannabis . it sets out parameters around the production , possession , safety standards , distribution , and sale of the drug . it also creates new criminal code offences for selling marijuana to minors . the proposed federal law spells out that it will be illegal for anyone younger than 18 to buy pot , but allows for provinces and territories to set a higher minimum age .     in a tweet , justice minister jody wilson-raybould , who was the bill ' s sponsor , and first introduced the legislation in april 2017 , said it was \" an historic milestone for progressive policy in canada . \"     the federal government is expected to formally respond to the bill ' s passage wednesday morning in the house of commons foyer .     last week , the government announced it would be accepting most but not all of the senate ' s more than 40 proposed amendments to bill c-45 . among the 13 amendments that the federal liberals rejected were the proposal to allow the provinces and territories to ban home-grown marijuana , and a proposed change to prohibit pot producers from distributing branded merchandise .     earlier in the evening , an attempt by conservative sen. claude carignan to insist on an amendment to let provinces ban marijuana home cultivation , failed .     reacting to his effort to push back on the government \u2019 s rejection of the change , carignan said his attempt was to give the provinces a right he believes they should have , in an effort to circumvent what is now likely : the matter winding up in court .     senators spent much of tuesday offering their final thoughts on the legislation , with some expressing disappointment and frustration over mps not accepting the senate ' s changes , and raising remaining concerns with the legislation as it stands .     others argued that the upper chamber had done its due diligence and that it was time to concede to the will of the elected house of commons , and pass the legislation .     in calling the vote , senate speaker george furey had a slip of the tongue and called \u201call those in flavour \u201d instead of \u201call those in favour , \u201d sending snickers through the chamber . \" it ' s getting late , \" sen. furey said .     speaking with reporters following the vote , sen. harder said he was finally pausing after the manoeuvrings and the procedural wrangling to acknowledge that after a very lengthy debate , canada is on the cusp of legalization after nearly a century of prohibition .     \" it is a step in the right direction and what we now need to do is to insure as we move forward in implementation , that everybody plays their role , that everybody understands the obligations that they have and uses the opportunity of the next number of weeks to inform themselves of what a legal cannabis market means for them , their family , their communities , and the opportunities and risks that it poses , \" said sen. harder .     so is marijuana legal ? no .     the bill still needs to receive royal assent , which is expected as soon as tomorrow . that is the final step -- essentially the crown approving the bill . it ' s overseen by canada ' s representative , the governor general .     once it passes , the government is expected to declare the date that legalization will come into force and be applicable .     on ctv ' s question period , parliamentary secretary and the federal government \u2019 s point-person on pot , bill blair said he expects the date to be some time this september .     that window of time between when the bill passes and when it becomes federal law is to allow for the provinces , territories , municipalities , police forces , and other stakeholders to make sure their piece of the pot pie is operating in accordance with the new rules .     blair said the date they decide on will be informed by discussions with their provincial and territorial counterparts , which have been given the ability to set regulations in their jurisdictions as to how a legalized marijuana regime will operate .     what you need to know :     many of the decisions around how legalized marijuana is sold and used will be up to the provinces and territories . here is what you need to know about what will be allowed :     the federally mandated public possession limit of 30 grams of dried cannabis has been maintained across the country , with most jurisdictions opting to keep their legal marijuana-smoking ages in line with those for drinking alcohol .     bill c-45 allows individuals to grow up to four marijuana plants per residence , though some provinces , like manitoba and quebec , plan to ban home cultivation .     provincial and territorial plans vary widely on whether you \u2019 ll be able to smoke in public .     provinces and territories also differ on whether pot shops will be publicly or privately owned . for those opting for publicly owned stores , these will be operated by provincial crown corporations that sell liquor . in some cases , provinces have even created subsidiaries of these companies with names . unless otherwise noted , these will be standalone stores wholly separate from those that sell alcohol .     while dried cannabis and cannabis oil -- both of which will be sold in 2018 -- can be used to make edible products at home , the federal government has said that packaged edible products won \u2019 t be commercially available .     for a comprehensive rundown of how each province is approaching legalized marijuana , click here .     outcome of drug-impaired driving bill pending     bill c-45 was introduced alongside bill c-46 which specifically deals with impaired driving . the government has hoped throughout the process that the two bills would pass in close succession .     this legislation proposes changes to the impaired driving laws to give police new powers to conduct roadside intoxication tests , including oral fluid drug tests , and would make it illegal to drive within two hours of being over the legal limit .     however , the senate amended bill c-46 to remove the provision that allowed police to conduct random roadside alcohol tests . the senate also sought to legally downgrade impaired driving offences so that they are not classified as \u201cserious criminality \u201d in order to protect foreign nationals and permanent residents from losing their statuses or becoming inadmissible to canada after such a conviction .     on monday , the government gave notice of its position on the senate changes , stating that it \u201crespectfully disagrees \u201d with these two changes . however , in the motion the government indicates it is willing to accept a handful of other senate amendments to the legislation .     the house has yet to send this message back to the senate but once that occurs , bill c-46 is in for a similar final debate and vote , as seen with bill c-45 , where senators will have to decide whether they insist , or accept and pass the bill .     the house of commons is scheduled to adjourn for the summer on friday , june 22 , but the senate is set to sit for a week longer . there is always the potential of an early adjournment , or the opportunity to sit longer in exceptional circumstances .     here ' s a recap of the final moments of debate in the senate . using our app ? touch here to see the recap below .\n"}], "parker":

parliament has passed a law legalising the recreational use of marijuana nationwide .     the cannabis act passed its final hurdle on tuesday in a 52-29 vote in the senate . the bill controls and regulates how the drug can be grown , distributed , and sold .     canadians will be able to buy and consume cannabis legally as early as this september .     the country is the second worldwide to legalise the drug ' s recreational use .     uruguay became the first country to legalise the sale of cannabis for recreational use in december 2013 , while a number of us states have also voted to permit it .     cannabis possession first became a crime in canada in 1923 but medical use has been legal since 2001.     the bill will likely receive royal assent this week , and the government will then choose an official date when the law will come into force .     prime minister justin trudeau tweeted that until now , \" it ' s been too easy for our kids to get marijuana - and for criminals to reap the profits \" .     but some groups objected to the new law , with opposition conservative politicians and indigenous groups among those voicing concerns .     the government is expected to give the provinces and territories , as well as municipalities , eight to 12 weeks to set up the new marijuana marketplace .     this timeframe will also allow industry and police forces to prepare for the new legal framework .     in 2015 , canadians were estimated to have spent about c$ 6bn ( $ 4.5bn , \u00a3 3.4bn ) on cannabis - almost as much as they did on wine .     how will legal marijuana in canada work ?     it is likely that by mid-september , canadians will be able to buy cannabis and cannabis oil grown by licensed producers at various retail locations .     canadians across the country will also be able to order the drug online from federally licensed producers , and grow up to four plants at home .     media playback is unsupported on your device media caption take a look inside the world ' s largest legal cannabis farm     adults will be able to possess up to 30 grams ( one ounce ) of dried cannabis in public .     edibles , or cannabis-infused foods , will not be immediately available for purchase but will be within a year of the bill coming into force . the delay is meant to give the government time to set out regulations specific to those products .     the minimum legal age to buy and consume marijuana has been set federally at 18 but some provinces have chosen to set it at 19.     provinces are in charge of how it is sold and have the power to set various other limits on its use within their jurisdiction - like where it can be smoked .     but the federal government has set guidelines for plain packaging with little branding and strict health warnings . it will also impose restrictions on promotions targeting young people , promotion through sponsorships , or depictions of celebrities , characters or animals in advertisements .     what will remain illegal ?     it will be illegal to possess more than 30 grams of cannabis in public , grow more than four plants per household and to buy from an unlicensed dealer .     image copyright press association image caption there will still be some restrictions on cannabis use in canada     penalties will be severe . someone caught selling the drug to a minor could be jailed for up to 14 years .     some critics say the penalties are too harsh and not proportional to similar laws like those around selling alcohol to minors .     what are the rules around the world ?     cannabis is banned in most countries but a number of places have decriminalised its use in recent years . the uk government said recently it would review the use of medicinal cannabis .     it is legal for medicinal purposes in 14 european countries , israel , argentina , puerto rico , panama , mexico , turkey , zambia and zimbabwe .     in the us , medicinal use is allowed in 29 states and the district of columbia , nine of the states have legalised both medical and personal cannabis use .     spain , the netherlands , portugal , slovenia , jamaica , chile , peru , colombia , ecuador and luxembourg are among countries that have relaxed legislation regarding personal use .     did anyone object ?     the new law has not been met with universal praise .     conservative party leader andrew scheer has previously said he was apprehensive it would normalise cannabis use and make it more accessible .     leo housakos , a conservative senator from quebec , tweeted to say that he thought the law would be \" catastrophic for canadian generations to come \" .     one specific concern being raised is the legal minimum age being set at 18 instead of 25 , as was recommended by multiple experts . however , the government ' s own task force recommended 18 , warning that setting the age limit too high could continue to encourage youth to buy marijuana on the illegal market .     opponents also question the potential public health impact of legalisation .     meanwhile , indigenous groups and politicians have voiced fears that their communities were not adequately consulted in the run-up to the vote .     indigenous services minister jane philpott and health minister ginette petitpas taylor had to write a letter to the chair and deputy chair of the senate ' s committee on aboriginal peoples earlier in june promising a full report to parliament addressing their concerns , narrowly averting a delay to the law ' s passage .     why is canada doing this now ?     this legislation fulfils a 2015 campaign promise by mr trudeau , the leader of the liberal party .     the prime minister has argued that canada ' s nearly century-old laws criminalising use of the drug have been ineffective , given that canadians are still among the world ' s heaviest users .     polls have repeatedly indicated that a solid majority of canadians are supportive of the move .     the decision to legalise recreational use of marijuana in canada comes as global trends shift away from criminal prohibition of the widely used drug .\n"}], "hannah": [{"url": "file://train/36/1/1", "title":
