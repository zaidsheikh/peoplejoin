university football players on scholarship are employees of the school and therefore entitled to hold an election to decide whether to unionize , an official of the national labor relations board ruled wednesday .     the stunning decision , coming after a push by former quarterback kain colter backed by organized labor , has the potential to shake up the world of big-time college sports .     the national collegiate athletic association and universities set the rules and cut the lucrative deals with tv networks and sponsors , exerting near total control over the activities of players known as \" student athletes . \" but now those football players , at least at northwestern , are employees too and may seek collective bargaining status , according to the 24-page ruling by peter sung ohr , the regional director of the nlrb .     ohr ' s decision is \" revolutionary for college sports , \" said robert mccormick , a professor emeritus at the michigan state university college of law who focuses on sports and labor law .     experts said the ruling could have wide impact beyond northwestern ' s locker room , potentially influencing other players , schools , and state and federal agencies . for example , mccormick said that if college players demand compensation for injuries suffered during training or a game , ohr ' s opinion could raise the question of whether they should be treated as employees under the state workers ' compensation act .     the decision also opens the door for athletes with scholarships at public universities to move more quickly to unionize because state labor boards , which govern public universities , usually follow labor law interpretations issued by the nlrb .     there were many questions left unanswered , including whether a union vote among northwestern players would succeed , but ohr ' s decision is preliminary . northwestern immediately said it will appeal to the nlrb in washington , and experts anticipate the case ultimately could be heard by the supreme court .     \" northwestern believes strongly that our student-athletes are not employees , but students , \" northwestern said in a statement . \" unionization and collective bargaining are not the appropriate methods to address the concerns raised by student-athletes . \"     northwestern ' s football players are the first in college sports to seek union representation . behind the effort is the college athletes players association , or capa , a union funded by ramogi huma , a former ucla linebacker who has become an advocate for players ' rights . capa is backed by the united steelworkers , which is covering the group ' s legal expenses .     \" this is a huge step toward justice for college athletes , \" huma said .     he said the ncaa invented the term \" student-athletes \" 60 years ago in an attempt to prevent students from unionizing . wednesday ' s decision , he said , asserts the rights of college athletes under labor law .     the union has said it would seek to negotiate over health and safety issues and does not intend to push for \" pay-for-play \" wages , which are not allowed under regulations issued by the ncaa .     among its demands , capa is seeking financial coverage for former players with sports-related medical expenses , independent concussion experts to be placed on the sidelines during games and the creation of an educational trust fund to help former players graduate .     it also wants players to receive compensation for commercial sponsorships , which it says is consistent with \" evolving \" ncaa regulations .     in siding with the union , ohr said the football players primarily have an economic relationship with the university , which controls and directs their daily activities and compensates them in the form of scholarships , which are worth about $ 76,000 per academic year if the player enrolls in summer classes .     \" the record makes clear that the employer ' s scholarship players are identified and recruited in the first instance because of their football prowess and not because of their academic achievement in high school , \" ohr wrote .     football players with scholarships , he said , \" fall squarely \" within in the labor law ' s definition of an employee . ohr said those players spend many more hours on their football duties than on their studies . furthermore , he said , the players are subject to special rules and policies that do not govern the general student population .     for example , he said , freshmen and sophomore students on scholarships are required to live on campus . upperclassmen , he added , can live off campus but are required to submit their lease for approval to their coach , pat fitzgerald .     \" even the players ' academic lives are controlled as evidenced by the fact that they are required to attend study hall if they fail to maintain a certain grade-point average ( gpa ) in their classes , \" ohr wrote .     northwestern argued that the term \" student athlete \" is still appropriate . \" we believe that participation in athletic events is part of the overall educational experience for those students , not a separate activity . \"\n"}, {"url": "file://val/33/2/1", "title": "val/33/2/1", "content": "northwestern football players qualify under federal law as employees of the university and

gary kohlman , the attorney representing the players , said in a telephone interview with bloomberg news .     it ' s a stunning ruling , but hardly the final one on the matter . northwestern has

huma listens during a news conference in chicago .... ( associated press )     the decision by a regional director of the national labor relations board means it agrees football players at the big ten school qualify as employees under federal law and therefore can legally unionize .     \" based on the entire record in this case , i find that the employer ' s football players who receive scholarships fall squarely within ( federal labor law ' s ) broad definition of ' employee , \" peter sung ohr , the nlrb regional director , said in his 24-page decision .     an employee is generally regarded by law as someone who receives compensation for a service and is under the direct control of managers . players argued that their scholarships are compensation and coaches are their managers .     the evanston , ill-based university argued college athletes , as students , don ' t fit in the same category as factory workers , truck drivers and other unionized workers . immediately after the ruling , the school announced it plans to appeal to labor authorities in washington , d.c.     alan cubbage , northwestern ' s vice president for university relations , said in a statement that while the school respects \" the nlrb process and the regional director ' s opinion , we disagree with it . \"     the specific goals of the college athletes players association , or capa , which would take the lead in organizing the players , include guaranteeing coverage of sports-related medical expenses for current and former players , ensuring better procedures to reduce head injuries and potentially letting players pursue commercial sponsorships .     but critics have argued that giving college athletes employee status and allowing them to unionize could hurt college sports in numerous ways , including by raising the prospects of strikes by disgruntled players or lockouts by athletic departments .     for now , the push is to unionize athletes at private schools , such as northwestern , because the federal labor agency does not have jurisdiction over public universities .     outgoing wildcats quarterback kain colter took a leading role in establishing capa . the united steelworkers union has been footing the legal bills .     colter , whose eligibility has been exhausted and who has entered the nfl draft , said nearly all of the 85 scholarship players on the wildcats roster backed the union bid , though only he expressed his support publicly .     capa attorneys argued that college football is , for all practical purposes , a commercial enterprise that relies on players ' labor to generate billions of dollars in profits . that , they contend , makes the relationship of schools to players one of employers to employees .     in its endeavor to have college football players be recognized as essential workers , capa likened scholarships to employment pay \u2014 too little pay from its point of view . northwestern balked at that claim , describing scholarship as grants .     the ncaa has been under increasing scrutiny over its amateurism rules and is fighting a class-action federal lawsuit by former players seeking a cut of the billions of dollars earned from live broadcasts , memorabilia sales and video games . other lawsuits allege the ncaa failed to protect players from debilitating head injuries .     ncaa president mark emmert has pushed for a $ 2,000-per-player stipend to help athletes defray some of expenses . critics say that isn ' t nearly enough , considering players help bring in millions of dollars to their schools and conferences .     during the nlrb ' s five days of hearings in february , wildcats coach pat fitzgerald took the stand for union opponents , and his testimony sometimes was at odds with colter ' s .     colter told the hearing that players ' performance on the field was more important to northwestern than their in-class performance , saying , \" you fulfill the football requirement and , if you can , you fit in academics . \" asked why northwestern gave him a scholarship of $ 75,000 a year , he responded : \" to play football . to perform an athletic service . \"     but fitzgerald said he tells players academics come first , saying , \" we want them to be the best they can be ... to be a champion in life . \"     an attorney representing the university , alex barbour , noted northwestern has one of the highest graduation rates for college football players in the nation , around 97 percent . barbour insisted , \" northwestern is not a football factory . \"     ___     follow michael tarm at https://twitter.com/mtarm\n"}]},
