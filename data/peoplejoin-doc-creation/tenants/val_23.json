( associated press )     the house committee on oversight and government reform is investigating several companies for exorbitant drug price increases , including embattled canadian drugmaker valeant pharmaceuticals .     shkreli became notorious after his company turing hiked the price of daraprim , the only approved drug for a rare and sometimes deadly parasitic infection , by 5,000 percent . since then , shkreli has been deluged with criticism from patients , politicians and the media , with some labeling him the \" most hated man in america . \"     last month , the 32-year-old former hedge fund manager was arrested in new york and charged with securities fraud and conspiracy related to another pharmaceutical company he previously ran called retrophin . shkreli pleaded not guilty and was released on $ 5 million bail . he resigned as ceo of turing , which he founded and ran .     he could not immediately be reached for comment wednesday evening .     the house committee issued the demand january 11 under chairman jason chaffetz , r-utah , according to a copy obtained by the associated press on wednesday .     \" i have been trying for the better part of a year to get information from martin shkreli about his outrageous price increases , and he has obstructed our investigation at every turn , \" said rep. elijah cummings , d-maryland , the committee ' s ranking democrat .     turing and valeant pharmaceuticals both previously refused requests for documents from cummings and other democrats .     the committee is also seeking testimony from turing ' s chief commercial officer , nancy retzlaff , valeant pharmaceutical ' s interim ceo , howard schiller , and experts from government and the private sector . calls placed to new york-based turing were not immediately returned .     a spokeswoman for laval , quebec-based valeant confirmed that schiller will testify next week . he was named interim ceo earlier this month after the company ' s chairman and ceo , j. michael pearson , was hospitalized for severe pneumonia .     concerns about sky-high drug prices have been building for years but boiled over last fall after news reports about turing , valeant and a handful of other drugmakers hiking prices of old drugs many times over their prior cost .     valeant drew congress ' interest following its purchase of the life-saving heart drugs nitropress and isuprel . the company , known for gobbling up smaller drugmakers to get their products and then slashing jobs and research programs , jacked up the drugs ' prices shortly after buying them from marathon pharmaceuticals in february , tripling one and raising the other six-fold .     daraprim , which turing acquired in august , is the only approved drug for a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women , cancer patients and aids patients .     amid mounting criticism from patients , doctors and politicians , shkreli pledged to lower daraprim ' s price , but later reneged and instead offered hospitals a 50 percent discount \u2014 still amounting to a 2,500 percent increase . patients normally take most of the weeklong treatment at home , so they still face the 5,000 percent price increase , though turing is offering financial aid to those who can ' t afford the drug .     both turing and valeant have also received multiple subpoenas from federal prosecutors seeking information about drug pricing and other business practices .\n"}, {"url": "file://val/23/0/3", "title": "val/23/0/3", "content": "breaking news emails get breaking news
