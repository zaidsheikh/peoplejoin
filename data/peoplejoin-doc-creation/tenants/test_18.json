and palo alto residents ,     this letter serves as my official resignation from the planning and transportation commission . my family has decided to move to santa cruz . after many years of trying to make it work in palo alto , my husband and i cannot see a way to stay in palo alto and raise a family here . we rent our current home with another couple for $ 6200 a month ; if we wanted to buy the same home and share it with children and not roommates , it would cost $ 2.7m and our monthly payment would be $ 12,177 a month in mortgage , taxes , and insurance . that \u2019 s $ 146,127 per year \u2014 an entire professional \u2019 s income before taxes . this is unaffordable even for an attorney and a software engineer .     it \u2019 s clear that if professionals like me cannot raise a family here , then all of our teachers , first responders , and service workers are in dire straits . we already see openings at our police department that we can \u2019 t fill and numerous teacher contracts that we can \u2019 t renew because the cost of housing is astronomical not just in palo alto but many miles in each direction . i have repeatedly made recommendations to the council to expand the housing supply in palo alto so that together with our neighboring cities who are already adding housing , we can start to make a dent in the jobs-housing imbalance that causes housing prices throughout the bay area to spiral out of control . small steps like allowing 2 floors of housing instead of 1 in mixed use developments , enforcing minimum density requirements so that developers build apartments instead of penthouses , legalizing duplexes , easing restrictions on granny units , leveraging the residential parking permit program to experiment with housing for people who don \u2019 t want or need two cars , and allowing single-use areas like the stanford shopping center to add housing on top of shops ( or offices ) , would go a long way in adding desperately needed housing units while maintaining the character of our neighborhoods and preserving historic structures throughout .     time and again , i \u2019 ve seen dozens of people come to both commission meetings and council meetings asking council to make housing its top priority . the city council received over 1000 signatures from palo alto residents asking for the same . in the annual our palo alto survey , it is the top issue cited by residents . this council has ignored the majority of residents and has charted a course for the next 15 years of this city \u2019 s development which substantially continues the same job-housing imbalance this community has been suffering from for some time now : more offices , a nominal amount of housing which the council is already laying the groundwork to tax out of existence , lip service to preserving retail that simply has no reason to keep serving the average joe when the city is only affordable to joe millionaires .     over the last 5 years i \u2019 ve seen dozens of my friends leave palo alto and often leave the bay area entirely . i \u2019 ve seen friends from other states get job offers here and then turn them down when they started to look at the price of housing . i struggle to think what palo alto will become and what it will represent when young families have no hope of ever putting down roots here , and meanwhile the community is engulfed with middle-aged jet-setting executives and investors who are hardly the sort to be personally volunteering for neighborhood block parties , earthquake preparedness responsibilities , or neighborhood watch . if things keep going as they are , yes , palo alto \u2019 s streets will look just as they did decades ago , but its inhabitants , spirit , and sense of community will be unrecognizable . a once thriving city will turn into a hollowed out museum . we should take care to remember that palo alto is famous the world over for its residents \u2019 accomplishments , but none of those people would be able to live in palo alto were they starting out today .     sincerely ,     kate downing     update : thank you so much for the outpouring of interest and support . while we are leaving palo alto , the organization i co-founded that is working to invest in housing and transportation will continue on its work so that maybe in the future we can have a more inclusive community . if you \u2019 d like to learn more , go here .     if you \u2019 d like to look into the belly of the beast , read the comments on our local paper : palo alto online . the loudest voices in the community feel that the desire to create more affordable housing is spoiled entitlement . until renters , younger people , and people of more modest means organize , this problem will continue throughout the bay area .\n"}, {"url": "file://test/18/0/4", "title": "test/18/0/4", "content": "in what \u2019 s becoming a regular story in the bay area , many peninsula towns \u2019 refusal to increase housing has led to a mass exit of long-time , working-class residents . first responders , police , teachers , grocery store clerks \u2014 the list goes on .     these small cities , rich with tech money and close-proximity desirability , have left it to san francisco , oakland , and only a few other areas to house the influx of new-moneyed arrivals .     and with that , another noteworthy exodus has taken place : palo alto planning and transportation commissioner kate vershov downing and her family have decided to leave the pricey town for santa cruz because they , like many other residents , can no longer afford the area .     in a letter of resignation , she starts off saying :     dear city council members and palo alto residents , this letter serves

welcome new arrival : kate and wills adopt pet cocker spaniel but the name remains a mystery         the duke and duchess of cambridge now have a three-month old puppy     the duke and duchess of cambridge have welcomed a new addition to their family - an adorable three-month old puppy .         the couple acquired the male cocker spaniel in early december and have been happily settling him in at their rented farmhouse in north wales .         remarkably , however , william and kate have given palace aides strict instructions not to publicly reveal the name of their pet , arguing that it is a \u2018private \u2019 matter .         \u2018he is a private pet and they do not want his name to be made public although the couple are happy to confirm that they do , indeed , have a new dog , \u2019 a spokesman at st james \u2019 s palace , the couple \u2019 s london headquarters , intoned .         royal sources say the black pup is \u2018a few months old \u2019 and comes from a litter bred by kate \u2019 s mother , carole middleton , who adores the breed .         \u2018i don \u2019 t know whether the middleton family dog is a boy or a girl , but the duke and duchess \u2019 s puppy is the result of the family dog breeding with one belonging to another breeder , \u2019 said an aide .         the new dog is the couple \u2019 s first together and replaces prince william \u2019 s black labrador , widgeon , who died about two years ago .         over the years , the royal family have embraced dogs as their favoured pets .     formal portraits from the 17th century onwards show kings , queens and their children happily posing with their beloved animals , from pugs to greyhounds , king charles spaniels to corgis .     some pets have even merited their own portraits , and , as in many households , were considered very much members of the family .     prince william \u2019 s black labrador , widgeon , died about two years ago ( left , stock picture ) but now he has acquired a male cocker spaniel with wife kate     when queen victoria \u2019 s beloved collie , noble , died at balmoral in 1887 , he was buried in the grounds of the castle and given his own gravestone , which read :         ' noble by name by nature noble too         faithful companion sympathetic true         his remains are interred here '         a terrier named caesar belonging to king edward vii was given even greater status when , having outlived the king , he walked behind his majesty \u2019 s coffin in the funeral procession .         the current queen is , of course , associated with the corgi .         the breed was introduced to the royal family by her father , king george vi , in 1933 when he bought a corgi called dookie from a local kennels .         for her eighteenth birthday , the queen was given a corgi named susan from whom numerous successive dogs were bred .         some corgis were mated with dachshunds ( most notably pipkin , who belonged to princess margaret ) to create \u2018dorgis \u2019 .     at present , the queen owns three corgis , monty , willow and holly and three dorgis , cider , candy and vulcan , who travel with her everywhere , with her majesty looking after them herself as much as possible .     tradition : the current queen is associated with the corgi     other members of the royal family own dogs of various breeds . the duchess of cornwall owns two jack russell terriers , tosca and rosie , and recently acquired a rescue pup called beth from battersea dogs and cats home .         spaniels are one of the oldest known breeds of dogs and are believed to have to come to the uk during caesar \u2019 s invasion in 55 and 54 bc .         it is assumed they originated from spain as the word spaniel is believed to have been derived from hispania or possibly from the french phrase chiens de l \u2019 espagnol ( dog of spain ) .         spaniels were initially bred to flush game out of dense brush but by the late 1600 \u2019 s had become specialized into water and land breeds .         the difference between cocker and springer spaniels is that the former are smaller , more compact , dogs and can have marginally more placid temperaments .         as a breed cocker spaniels have friendly , affectionate , happy natures and considered to be wonderful family pets .         the arrival of the couple \u2019 s anonymous new pooch is particularly timely as he will help keep kate , 30 , company while her husband is posted to the falkland islands for six weeks .         search and rescue pilot william , 29 , will fly out tonight with his sea king crew on a routine deployment to the region , leaving his wife on her own .         she is expected to spend more time in london while he is away and will largely live with her pup at kensington palace , the couple \u2019 s london base .         last night betting firm ladbrokes were offering odds of 10/1 on the dog being called charlie , 33/1 on bouncer and 66/1 on fenton , after the now world-famous hound seen chasing deer in richmond park , which became a youtube sensation .         the pup has not been formally revealed in public yet but has been seen being walked by the couple on beaches near their anglesey home .\n"}, {"url": "file://test/18/2/1", "title": "test/18/2/1", "content": "for years now , movie theater operators have been trying to dissuade their customers from chatting on cell phones or texting during shows . some issue stern pre-show warnings that anyone caught texting or talking will be shown the door .     it ' s not surprising then that the new chief executive and president of amc theaters , adam m. aron , caused a stir by suggesting that nation ' s second-largest movie theater company would consider the idea of making certain auditoriums \" more texting friendly \" in a bid to get millennials to go to the movies more often .     \" when you tell a 22-year-old to turn off the phone , don ' t ruin the movie , they hear please cut off your left arm above the elbow , \" said aron in an interview with variety published online wednesday .     \" you can ' t tell a 22-year-old to turn off their cellphone . that ' s not how they live , \" said aron , who hailed from outside the movie business before taking the reins of parent company amc entertainment holdings ( amc ) in january .     his suggestion that the company might revisit its stance on texting during shows didn ' t sit well with many movie buffs , who flooded amc ' s social media accounts with objections . some threatened to take their business elsewhere if amc followed through with the idea .     the company quickly responded to the backlash with the following post : \" press reports we are considering test allowing texts in a very few screens . we know vast majority of audience wants no texting . if ever , we only would pursue this in a way that we can be totally confident all our guests will fully enjoy the movie-going experience at amc . \"     that still wasn ' t enough to quell critics on twitter and facebook . by friday , amc retreated with a company statement that included the following tweet :     no texting at amc . won ' t happen . you spoke . we listened . quickly , that idea has been sent to the cutting room floor . pic.twitter.com/jr0fo5megr \u2014 amc theatres ( @amctheatres ) april 15 , 2016     aron , former ceo of starwood hotels &amp; resorts ( hot ) , is no doubt mulling new ways for amc to woo an increasingly distracted and demanding audience . rather than turn off their smartphones , many millennials would rather skip the theater altogether , or kick back at home and stream movies on their flat-screen tvs or mobile devices , via netflix ( nflx ) and other services .     in 2015 , america ' s 18- to 24-year olds represented 10 percent of the u.s. population and bought 14 percent of all movie tickets sold here , down from 16 percent in 2014 , according to stan meyers , a piper jaffray &amp; co. analyst who covers media and entertainment companies .     teens , somewhat surprisingly , are going to the movies more often these days , as are those in the 60-plus set , as measured by their percentage contributions to overall ticket sales between 2014 and 2015 , said meyers .     \" one of the things keeping millennials away from the movies is that they need to be on their phones all the time . what [ adam aron ] wants to do is segregate different groups so that people don ' t want to be on their phones , i.e. , older demographic groups , and those who do could be in different [ auditoriums ] , \" said meyers .     in his first few months as ceo , aron has taken other steps to ensure that amc , known as an innovator in the movie business , stays competitive in the face of demographic shifts and rapid technological change . in march , amc announced that it has struck a deal to acquire carmike cinemas ( ckec ) , a merger that would create the world ' s largest chain of movie theaters .     amc , a subsidiary of chinese conglomerate dalian wanda group , is also reportedly close to a deal with the screening room , a startup that will offer new releases in the home , via a set-top box that transmits movies , for $ 50 per view , according to variety .     the venture is controversial within the movie business , but variety reports that the screening room , backed by sean parker of facebook ( fb ) and napster fame , is seeking to pave its way by sharing its proceeds with distributors and providing customers with two free movie tickets per view , which would help boost concession sales for theater operators .     but it ' s the texting controversy that has put amc in the hot seat in the eyes of some moviegoers . that is perhaps not surprising given that some people feel so strongly about the etiquette surrounding cell phone use in theaters that the issue has sparked violence . in early 2014 an argument between two men in a theater in wesley chapel , florida , over texting ended in a fatal shooting . before the argument erupted , the man who was eventually shot was sending text messages to his daughter during the previews to the movie .\n"},
