happening at google \u2019 s campus today , emphasized the importance of engineers \u201cbuilding products for everyone in the world , \u201d and said that in order to do that , \u201cwe need to have people internally who represent the world in totality. \u201d     \u201ci want you to know there \u2019 s a place for you in this industry , \u201d pichai said to the teams of young women who were finalists in a months-long app-building competition . \u201cthere \u2019 s a place for you at google . don \u2019 t let anyone tell you otherwise . you belong here , and we need you. \u201d     pichai \u2019 s remarks were especially noteworthy because of their juxtaposition with the controversy happening at google right now , after a software engineer posted a diversity-related memo that went viral both within the company and in public sphere . the author of the memo , which questioned google \u2019 s diversity training and women \u2019 s aptitude for coding , has since been fired from the company , and has filed a complaint with the national labor relations board .     the public appearance by pichai also came just after google canceled a company-wide town hall meeting , which had been scheduled to address some of the fallout from the memo . the meeting was canceled , according to a report in recode , after employees who had sent preliminary questions started getting harassed online .     \u201cit ' s really important that more women and girls have the opportunity to participate in technology , to learn how to code , create , and innovate , \u201d pichai said .     \u201cseeing the girls here tonight gives me hope for the future. \u201d     the coding event this evening was co-hosted by iridescent learning , an la-based nonprofit that has run the technovation competition for the past several years . google offers a variety of education opportunities focused on coding , as do many other large tech companies ; this event was a part of its \u201cmade with code \u201d program , aimed at young women .     of course , as with other workshops , coding camps , and initiatives that tech companies offer , many of them still struggle with creating truly diverse workplaces , as their volunteered annual reports have shown . and google has also been sued for its salary records by the us department of labor , which has alleged that google doesn \u2019 t pay female employees fairly .     pichai \u2019 s full comments are below :\n"}], "dewei": [{"url": "file://val/11/1/0", "title": "val/11/1/0", "content": "google ' s ceo , sundar pichai , canceled a scheduled all-hands staff meeting \u2014 moments before it was scheduled to begin \u2014 meant to address concerns over a controversial essay published by former employee james damore .     in an email to staff , pichai explained that questions from employees had been leaked and that , in some cases , specific employees ' identities were revealed , exposing them to harassment and threats . instead of today ' s large-scale meeting , which was to be livestreamed to google ' s 60,000 employees worldwide , smaller groups will meet sometime in the future .     \" we had hoped to have a frank open discussion today as we always do to bring us together and move forward . but our dory questions appeared externally this afternoon , and on some websites googlers are now being named personally , \" pichai said in the email .     pichai said in the email that while the majority of googlers were supportive of the decision , some wished the company would do more . he said some also worried about not being able to speak freely at work .     \" all of your voices and opinions matter and i want to hear them , \" he said .     earlier in the day , questions began to be posted to google ' s internal message boards that were to be included in today ' s planned meeting .     \" can we get an update on progress toward identifying leakers ? \" one employee posted , saying multiple googlers had their team pages leaked to alt-right sites , resulting in a death threat in one instance .     \" i am a moderately conservative googler , \" wrote one employee , \" and i am and have been scared to share my beliefs . the loud voice here is a liberal one . conservative voices are hushed . what is leadership doing to ensure googlers like me feel *invited and accepted* , not just tolerated or safe from angry mobs ? \"     another question asked how to combat damore ' s assertion that google has a lower bar for diversity candidates . \" this is hurting minority googlers because it creates the perception they are less qualified , \" an employee wrote .     pichai , who said that parts of damore ' s manifesto violated google ' s code of conduct , had cut his vacation short to attend today ' s schediuled meeting .     \" clearly there ' s a lot more to discuss as a group -- including how we create a more inclusive environment for all , \" he wrote in an email sent to employees tuesday .     damore ' s 3,300 word manifesto claims there aren ' t more women in tech roles due to \" biological causes \" while also calling google left-leaning with a \" politically correct monoculture . \" the memo has spurred a conversation about systematic sexism in silicon valley , as well as what is and is not acceptable to debate in a workplace environment .\n"}, {"url": "file://val/11/2/0", "title": "val/11/2/0", "content": "herman cain expressed confidence at tuesday \u2019 s debate that his much-touted \u201c9-9-9 \u201d plan to revamp the tax code would pass congress , but the paid campaign consultant who scored the plan for cain said the idea was more of a theory than a politically viable solution \u2014 and not the route he would suggest himself .     \u201cyou \u2019 re trying to go to a system that taxes income once and only once and quits double-taxing savings , \u201d gary robbins told politico on wednesday . \u201cthat \u2019 s something that can really juice the economy , it \u2019 s probably worth 15 percent in growth . \u2026 the problem with the big-bang changes like that , the flat tax or the fair tax , is that they are so alien to the current system that it would be a great big shock. \u201d     text size -     +     reset 2012 field piles on 9-9-9 plan politico 44     though robbins says the plan would work fiscally and economically , he believes people would never accept such drastic changes .     cain has repeatedly declined to name the people involved with crafting the plan besides rich lowrie , cain \u2019 s chief economic adviser , a cleveland-based wealth manager for wells fargo who is not a trained economist . but it was robbins , an economist who has worked for steve forbes \u2019 s flat-tax campaigns and was a longtime treasury employee , who conducted a 10-page analysis of the plan in september . robbins found the plan to be revenue neutral , as cain \u2019 s been trumpeting in recent debates and in interviews .     \u201ceconomically , it \u2019 s fine , there \u2019 s nothing wrong with the plan and nothing wrong with the proposal , \u201d robbins said . \u201cwhat cain has done is really smart and saying if you go this route , this is the way to go . he \u2019 s done a very good job and the fellows who were beating on him last night were making a mistake. \u201d     robbins said he \u2019 s performed various economics-related tasks for the campaign . he said he answers questions from lowrie as recently as this week in response to a scathing wall street journal editorial that picked apart the 9-9-9 plan .     \u201cthey are really technical questions about how you describe things , \u201d robbins said . \u201che wanted to make sure he was describing faithfully what was happening. \u201d     cain spokesman j.d . gordon confirmed that robbins scored the 9-9-9 plan for the campaign but declined to address other questions about him . lowrie did not immediately respond to emails sent to his personal and campaign accounts .     robbins , who with his wife runs an arlington operation called fiscal policy associates , inc. , was once a senior fellow at the texas-based institute for policy innovation . in 2003 , jude wanniski , who is credited with coining the phrase \u201csupply-side economics , \u201d wrote in a washington times op-ed that robbins is \u201carguably the most respected of all supply-side tax experts. \u201d     robbins said he served for 16 years in the treasury department , leaving in 1985 after working as economist in the office of tax policy and for ronald reagan \u2019 s assistant secretary for economic affairs . he has a bachelor \u2019 s degree in math and physics from texas tech university and a master \u2019 s degree in economics from southern methodist university in dallas .     while robbins praised the idea of 9-9-9 , he took steps during an interview to distance himself from its author .     \u201cit \u2019 s not a plan that i concocted , \u201d robbins said . \u201cthere \u2019 s nothing wrong with the plan , it just wouldn \u2019 t be the one i picked. \u201d\n"}]}, "user_id_to_descriptions": {"alice": "Is interested in compiling a
