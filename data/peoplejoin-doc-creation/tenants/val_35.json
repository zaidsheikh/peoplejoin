( associated press )     britain immediately raised concerns about ghoncheh ghavami ' s trial . the case highlighted the limits to free expression inside iran and efforts by authorities to enforce strict interpretations of islamic norms despite a policy of greater openness being pursued by moderate president hassan rouhani .     the 25-year-old woman ' s brother , iman ghavami , said the family had been hoping she would be set free based on time already served since her june arrest . they are still trying to get official details of the verdict , he said .     \" we ' re disappointed and kind of shocked . we really hoped she ' d be released , \" he told the associated press .     ghavami ' s lawyer , mahmoud alizadeh tabatabaei , said in an interview that a court found her guilty of \" propagating against the ruling system . \" tabatabaei said he was shown the text of the verdict but is still waiting to receive it officially .     \" i was told at the court today that my client ' s case has been referred back to the prosecutor because ghavami is facing new charges . so , the verdict was not given to me , \" he said .     tabatabaei didn ' t elaborate what the new charges are or why fresh charges have been raised against his client now .     ghavami was detained in june at tehran ' s freedom stadium after trying to attend a men ' s volleyball match between iran and italy .     she is a graduate of the university of london ' s school of oriental and african studies and had been volunteering to help street kids in iran for a few months , her brother said .     women are banned from attending male-only matches in iran . ghavami tried to enter the stadium with other women to protest the ban , according to amnesty international . female photographers inside the complex were also ordered to leave , though none was arrested .     ghavami was held along with the other protesters for a few hours before being released . she was detained again a few days later and stood trial last month . her brother said she had no access to her lawyer until it came time for her court hearing .     \" this whole case has been full of abnormalities , \" iman ghavami said .     ghavami has been held in solitary confinement for much of her time at tehran ' s evin prison , according to amnesty . she went on hunger strike at one point last month to protest her detention .     the rights group sharply criticized sunday ' s verdict and called ghavami a prisoner of conscience .     \" it ' s an outrage that a young woman is being locked up simply for peacefully having her say about how women are discriminated against in iran , \" amnesty international uk director kate allen said .     iman ghavami said he believes authorities singled out his sister from the other female protesters because she holds both british and iranian citizenship . iranian authorities do not recognize dual nationalities for its citizens and treats them as iranians under law .     the british foreign office expressed doubts about the sentence sunday .     \" we have concerns about the grounds for this prosecution , due process during the trial and miss ghavami ' s treatment whilst in custody , \" it said in a statement .     iran ' s moderate president rouhani has faced resistance from hard-liners who feel he is too soft on those who challenge strict interpretations of islam .     in one case earlier this year , six young iranian men and women who shot a video of themselves dancing together and unveiled to pharrell williams ' \" happy \" were arrested along with the film ' s

370 that disappeared in 2014 , according to a source close to the investigation .     the source said there is a unique element to the boeing 777 ' s flaperon , a wing component , that boeing observers believe they are seeing in photos .     the debris was found wednesday off the coast of reunion island , a french department in the western indian ocean . it is being examined to determine whether it is connected to flight mh370 , a member of the french air force in reunion said wednesday .     the debris was found off the coast of st. andre , a community on the island , according to adjutant christian retournat .     boeing officials conducted an initial assessment of the debris using photographs . the source stressed the observations are preliminary .     police carry a piece of debris from an unidentified aircraft found off the coast of reunion island .     k.s . narendran , whose wife was on the plane , said he was reticent to call the discovery a major development .     \" i think this is very early days yet . all we know is that a small part has been found . it is still a little early to suggest it does belong to mh370 , \" he told cnn ' s \" erin burnett outfront \" from india . \" i think it is premature to feel that it is all coming to a close or that we are even closer to the truth . \"     sarah bajc , whose partner , philip wood , was on mh370 , said her \" heart has been in my throat for most of the day . \"     during the initial days of the search for the plane , there were several reports of possible debris sightings in the waters closer to where authorities believe the plane went down , but none of those was actual wreckage . bajc said as an emotional safety mechanism she disbelieves any reports like wednesday ' s discovery .     she wants verification , she told \" anderson cooper 360\u02da . \"     \" if ultimately this is the piece of the wing , then that little thread of hope that i have been holding on to will , will have to break . and reality will have to take over , \" she said holding back tears . \" but , yeah , up until now , i and most of the family members have continued to believe that until we have a body ... we can ' t give up hoping they will still come back . \"     if this turns out to be a piece of mh370 , it would be the first piece of physical evidence that the plane crashed .     malaysian team en route     earlier , retournat said the debris appeared to be a wing flap and had been taken to the island , about 380 nautical miles off the coast of madagascar .     the malaysian government has dispatched a team to reunion island to investigate the debris , malaysian minister of transportation liow tiong lai said in new york .     \" we need to verify . we have wreckage found that needs to be further verified before we can further confirm if it belongs to mh370 . so we have dispatched a team to investigate on these issues and we hope that we can identify it as soon as possible , \" the minister said .     malaysia airlines said it was working with authorities to determine where the part came from .     \" at the moment , it would be too premature for the airline to speculate on the origin of the flaperon , \" the carrier said .     cnn analysts said there are indications the airplane part could be from a boeing 777 , and if that ' s the case , it ' s likely from mh370 .     making the determination should be \" very simple \" because the serial numbers riveted to numerous parts of the plane can be linked to not only the plane ' s model , but also the exact aircraft , said cnn aviation analyst les abend , who flew 777s during his 30 years as a pilot .     this means crash investigators may be able to figure it out from photographs of the part , which could be an aileron , a flap or a flaperon , even before arriving on the island , he said .     several clues     airplane debris is being examined to see if it ' s connected to mh370 .     there are at least three elements of the discovery that are consistent with mh370 , said cnn safety analyst david soucie . the first is that the part appears to have been torn off the aircraft .     \" this is from a sudden impact , it looks like to me , \" soucie said .     there also is a seal on the top of the part that \" is consistent with what i would see on an inside flap on a triple 7 , \" he said , and the barnacles on the part are consistent with the \" parasitic activity \" that would take place from being underwater so long .     however , the part appears to be coated in white paint , which would run counter to soucie ' s other observations in that the 777 ' s parts would be coated in zinc chromate , not paint . soucie acknowledged , however , that the part could be coated in something from the ocean .     \" if it is a part from a triple 7 , we can be fairly confident it is from 370 because there just haven ' t been that many triple 7 crashes and there haven ' t been any in this area , \" said cnn aviation analyst mary schiavo .     antoine forestier , a journalist on the island where the debris was found , said people who were on shore gardening saw the plane part drifting in the ocean .     reporters from antenne reunion looked at the debris , which forestier said was about 2 meters by 1 meter ( 6.5 feet by 3 feet ) .     there was a marking \" bb670 \" on the part .     soucie said he believes the number is a part number , though it might be from a subcontractor .     drift possibilities     the head of the australian transport safety bureau , the agency tasked by malaysia with leading the search for mh370 , said the piece of debris is \" not inconsistent \" with drift modeling done by australian authorities .     \" if there was something from mh370 it could have reached reunion island from the area we ' re covering , \" said atsb chief commissioner martin dolan . \" it ' s not inconsistent with the drift modeling we ' ve done . it ' s not inconsistent with the search area we ' re covering . \"     dolan would not say how likely it was that any debris would move in a westerly direction .     \" there ' s a range of possibilities , \" he said . \" it ' s not an exact science . \" dolan said surface currents , wind direction and how high an object was floating in the water might all play a role .     photos : the search for mh370 two years after malaysia

noticed the article titled \" viscoelastic suppression of gravity-driven counterflow instability . \"     ok , maybe not . but it was actually worth a look . it turns out the article describes how engineers might have been able to stop the bp blowout in the gulf of mexico last year using a child ' s plaything : oobleck . it ' s a weird mixture of cornstarch and water . when it moves slowly , it flows like a liquid . move it fast , and it freezes into a solid .     the idea of using oobleck came to jonathan katz , a physics professor at washington university in st. louis , last may . he was on a small group of experts that u.s. energy secretary steven chu pulled together to advise him about the catastrophe .     so katz was on hand when bp tried to stop the well by pumping a dense fluid called drilling mud down it \u2014 the so-called top-kill approach . it failed .     \" we ' d predicted that [ would fail ] , so we were disappointed like everybody else was , but not enormously surprised , \" katz says . \" and so i was scratching my head and saying , ' is there some solution to this problem? ' \"     make your own oobleck oobleck is remarkably easy to make : just combine 2 parts cornstarch to 1 part water . slowly stir in the cornstarch into the water . mix slowly \u2014 you ' ll find that the more aggressive the stirring , the harder it is . add a few drops of food coloring if you wish .     oobleck vs. oil     the problem , as katz saw it , was that oil and gas blasting up the well tended to break up the drilling mud into fine particles , and a light mist like that ends up getting shot up the pipe and dumped onto the seafloor .     katz wondered whether there was some kind of fluid that wouldn ' t immediately be dispersed into tiny particles when it encountered the rapidly flowing oil .     \" i realized after a while that cornstarch suspension \u2014 oobleck , the kids call it \u2014 has this wonderful property that if it ' s not flowing rapidly , it ' s a liquid that flows pretty well , \" katz says . \" but if you try to make it flow rapidly , it suddenly turns stiff and it doesn ' t flow at all . \"     oobleck versus a stream of bubbling hot oil ? really ? yep .     \" i made some rough estimates ; it looked like it was going to work , \" katz says .     and katz had an inside track here \u2014 being on the energy secretary ' s advisory panel , he participated in daily telephone briefings and frequent e-mail exchanges . he had about as much access as you could hope .     \" so i certainly sent it to everybody on the lists . i don ' t know who read it \u2014 you can never tell , \" he says .     but katz was dismissed from the panel shortly thereafter because of some controversial social opinions on his website . even so , katz says he still dreamed that his solution could solve the problem and end in triumph . of course it didn ' t work out that way .     \" i don ' t fault the pros , \" he says . \" they have a toolbox ; they use the tools in their toolbox . this isn ' t the place to do physics experiments , especially one that would cost quite a bit of money . \"     cornstarch is cheap , but the rest of the operation would not be .     \" and of course the drilling mud industry isn ' t used to mixing cornstarch into their stuff , so it was completely new for them , \" he says . \" it wasn ' t something they had available in their tanks ready to go . they would have had to prepare a custom solution and take it out to the well . \"     a pumping problem     and that was not going to happen . instead , after bp stopped the well through more conventional means , katz and some associates at the lawrence livermore national laboratory did a small-scale experiment with the cornstarch mixture and mineral oil .     they report in that physical review letters article that it performed as katz had predicted under these highly idealized circumstances . whether it would have worked in the real world is an open question . prof. steve wereley , who teaches fluid dynamics at purdue university , says the concept is clever .     \" the problem with using something like cornstarch and water is getting it where it needs to be , \" wereley says .     you ' d have to pump a lot of it , fast , into the well if it ' s going to work . and there might be trouble pumping it \u2014 remember , oobleck gets stiff when it ' s put under pressure .     \" it would tend to create that same reaction when you ' re trying to pump it down the hole . \"     wereley calculates that you ' d have to pump it so slowly that you couldn ' t get it down the hole faster than the oil was rushing up . and that ' s a big problem .     a bp spokeswoman told npr their engineers reviewed the idea and decided it wouldn ' t work . but katz still figures it ' s a good idea worth exploring for the next time an oil well is running completely out of control .\n"}]}, "user_id_to_descriptions": {"alice": "Is interested in compiling a summary.", "farshid": "Knows about the following topics:\n", "parker": "Knows about the following topics:\nIran, Ghoncheh Ghavami, volleyball, ban, women", "dewei": "Knows about the following topics:\nMH370, Malaysia Airlines, Indian Ocean, wreckage, Xavier Tytelman\nIran, Ghoncheh Ghavami, volleyball, propaganda, prison\nGhoncheh Ghavami, Iran, volleyball, prison, anti-regime propaganda", "bhushan": "Knows about the following topics:\nAlexa Internet, Internet Archive, Wayback Machine\nMH370, debris, Indian Ocean, Boeing 777, Malaysia Airlines\noil well, top-kill, turbulent flow\nBP oil spill, oobleck, cornstarch, Jonathan Katz, Steven Chu"}, "user_id_to_table_names": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_templated": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_lowprecision": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_lowprecision_templated": {}}
