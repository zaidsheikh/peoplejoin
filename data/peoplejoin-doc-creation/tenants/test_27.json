at which guidelines recommend screenings start , a new analysis shows . one in seven colon cancer patients is under 50. younger patients are more likely to have advanced stage cancer , but they live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence because they are treated aggressively , the researchers reported . \" colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly , \" said study lead author dr. samantha hendren , an associate professor of surgery at the university of michigan in ann arbor .     \" this study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50 , \" she added .     however , hendren said it ' s too soon to say whether colon cancer screening guidelines should be altered to reflect that trend .     in the analysis , colon cancer among younger patients was often found at an advanced stage , meaning the disease has spread to lymph nodes or other organs . \" part of the reason for this is that these young patients are often diagnosed only after their cancers start to cause symptoms , such as anemia , bowel bleeding or a blockage in the colon , \" hendren explained .     doctors should be on the lookout for these warning signs of colon cancer , she added .     not all bowel bleeding is caused by cancer , she said . \" bright red bleeding with a bowel movement is usually due to hemorrhoids or fissures , but dark blood or blood mixed with the stool is a warning sign , \" hendren said .     people with a family history of colon cancer and others who are at higher risk should begin screening earlier than the age of 50 , she said . \" this is already recommended , but we don ' t think this is happening consistently , and this is something we need to optimize , \" she added .     the report was published online jan. 25 in the journal cancer .     dr. andrew chan , an associate professor of medicine at harvard medical school in boston , said the reasons for the increase in colon cancer among younger adults isn ' t known .     \" it is unexplained , \" he said . \" it ' s not simply a change in diagnoses , it ' s a very real increase . there may be an effect of our environment that could be contributing to the increase . \"     smoking , obesity and physical inactivity are all risk factors for colon cancer , as is a poor diet , chan said . \" when we are faced with patients who have many of these elements , we should think more about the potential of them developing colon cancer at an earlier age , \" he said .     for the study , hendren and her colleagues culled federal government data on nearly 260,000 patients diagnosed with colon cancer between 1998 and 2011.     of these patients , nearly 15 percent were younger than 50. these patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced cancer and more likely to have surgery than older patients ( 72 percent versus 63 percent ) . radiation therapy was also used more often in younger patients than in older patients ( 53 percent versus 48 percent ) , the researchers found .     younger patients lived a little longer without a cancer recurrence , even though they tended to have more advanced cancer , hendren said .     for patients under 50 , about 68 percent survived five years , while about 67 percent of the patients 50 and older survived five years , she said . \" it looks like patients ' young age helps them in their cancer treatment and survival , \" she added .     these findings raise the question of whether screening for colon cancer should begin at an earlier age , hendren said . \" this would be a big and costly change , and i don ' t know whether it would help more people than it would hurt , so a lot of research would be required to understand this before any changes should be made , \" she said .     chan noted that although the incidence of colon cancer is increasing among people under 50 , the risk is still low . \" i don ' t think the data at this point support expanding screening to younger age groups , \" he said .     hendren said that \" the cancer community needs to prepare for the increasing number of very young colorectal cancer survivors who will need long-term support to cope with the physical and psychological consequences of their disease and treatments . \"     more information     visit the u.s. national cancer

"file://test/27/1/2", "title": "test/27/1/2", "content": "( reuters health ) - one in seven colon and rectal cancers in the u.s. are now diagnosed in patients younger than age 50 , which is when people are advised to begin routine screenings for these tumors , a new study finds .     by 2030 , nearly one in four rectal tumors and more than one in 10 colon cancers will be diagnosed in people under 50 , researchers estimate in the journal cancer .     \u201ccolorectal cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly ; this study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colorectal cancers are occurring in young people , \u201d said senior study author dr. samantha hendren of the university of michigan in ann arbor .     researchers analyzed cancer registry data from 1998 to 2011 for about 258,000 patients with colorectal tumors and found that 37,847 of them , or almost 15 percent , were diagnosed before age 50.     compared with older patients , those under 50 were 30 percent more likely to be diagnosed with tumors that had spread to the lymph nodes and 50 percent more likely to have cancer that had advanced to other organs , the study found .     younger patients with tumors that had metastasized , or reached other organs , were also more likely than older people to get more aggressive treatments .     about 72 percent of people under 50 got surgery , compared with 63 percent of older individuals . and while 53 percent of younger patients received radiation , just 48 percent of older people did .     even though patients diagnosed younger tended to have more aggressive disease , they also lived slightly longer without tumors returning after their initial course of treatment .     five-year survival odds were about 95 percent for patients under 50 diagnosed with local tumors that hadn \u2019 t spread yet , compared to roughly 92 percent for older people .     with tumors that spread to the lymph nodes , five-year survival rates were 76 percent for young people and 70 percent for older patients , while with cancers that metastasized to other organs the survival odds were 21 percent versus 14 percent , respectively .     one shortcoming of the study is that researchers lacked data on family history and other risk factors for colorectal cancers , the authors note . it \u2019 s also possible that treatment choices and overall survival were influenced by what \u2019 s known as selection bias , when healthier people may get more interventions and have better outcomes .     often , patients may get an early warning of colorectal tumors with symptoms such as bleeding , changes in bowel habits or pain when going to the bathroom that can point to the need for diagnostic screening , said dr. joel randolph hecht , director of the gastrointestinal oncology program at the david geffen school of medicine at the university of california los angeles .     \u201cunfortunately , these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids , \u201d hecht , who wasn \u2019 t involved in the study , said by email .     there are guidelines for screening some people starting at age 40 if they have a family history of colorectal cancer , noted dr. sidney winawer of memorial sloan kettering cancer center in new york .     \u201cwithout a family history , physicians need to use their judgment when seeing young people who have bowel symptoms and refer those of concern to a gastroenterologist for a diagnostic workup , \u201c winawer , who wasn \u2019 t involved in the study , added by email . \u201cthis is difficult since we do not wish to expose young people to unnecessary tests. \u201d     it isn \u2019 t clear from the study findings , however , whether changing preventive screening guidelines to start at a younger age would ultimately prevent more cancer deaths , said dr. david weinberg , chairman of medicine at the fox chase cancer center in philadelphia .     \u201cif the goal of screening is disease prevention , as it generally is for colorectal cancer , it is not clear when screening should start , \u201d weinberg , who wasn \u2019 t involved in the study , said by email . \u201ctoo early and the yield of screening will be very low since young people are still less likely to get colorectal cancer than older people. \u201d     source : bit.ly/23o5qvc cancer , online january 25 , 2016 .\n"}], "dewei": [], "parker": [{"url": "file://test/27/0/0", "title": "test/27/0/0",
