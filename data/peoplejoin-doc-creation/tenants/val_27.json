the decision to become involved militarily in the libyan civil war couldn ' t take place within a less hospitable context . the u.s. is reeling from spending and deficits , we ' re already in two wars , our military has been stretched to the limit , we ' re restive at home , and no one , really , sees president obama as the kind of leader you ' d follow over the top . \" this way , men ! \" \" no , i think i ' ll stay in my trench . \" people didn ' t hire him to start battles but to end them . they didn ' t expect him to open new fronts . did he not know this ?     he has no happy experience as a rallier of public opinion and a leader of great endeavors ; the central initiative of his presidency , the one that gave shape to his leadership , health care , is still unpopular and the cause of continued agitation . when he devoted his entire first year to it , he seemed off point and out of touch .     this was followed by the bp oil spill , which made him look snakebit . now he seems incompetent and out of his depth in foreign and military affairs . he is more observed than followed , or perhaps i should say you follow him with your eyes and not your heart . so it ' s funny he ' d feel free to launch and lead a war , which is what this confused and uncertain military action may become .     what was he thinking ? what is he thinking ?     which gets me to mr. obama ' s speech , the one he hasn ' t given . i cannot for the life of me see how an american president can launch a serious military action without a full and formal national address in which he explains to the american people why he is doing what he is doing , why it is right , and why it is very much in the national interest . he referred to his aims in parts of speeches and appearances when he was in south america , but now he ' s home . more is needed , more is warranted , and more is deserved . he has to sit at that big desk and explain his thinking , put forward the facts as he sees them , and try to garner public support . he has to make a case for his own actions . it ' s what presidents do ! and this is particularly important now , because there are reasons to fear the current involvement will either escalate and produce a lengthy conflict or collapse and produce humiliation .     without a formal and extended statement , the air of weirdness , uncertainty and confusion that surrounds this endeavor will only deepen .     the questions that must be answered actually start with the essentials . what , exactly , are we doing ? why are we doing it ? at what point , or after what arguments , did the president decide u.s. military involvement was warranted ? is our objective practical and doable ? what is america ' s overriding strategic interest ? in what way are the actions taken , and to be taken , seeing to those interests ?     matthew kaminski of the editorial board explains america ' s role in the libyan campaign .     from those questions flow many others . we know who we ' re against \u2014 moammar gadhafi , a bad man who ' s done very wicked things . but do we know who we ' re for ? that is , what does the u.s. government know or think it knows about the composition and motives of the rebel forces we ' re attempting to assist ? for 42 years , gadhafi controlled his nation ' s tribes , sects and groups through brute force , bribes and blandishments . what will happen when they are no longer kept down ? what will happen when they are no longer oppressed ? what will they become , and what role will they play in the coming drama ? will their rebellion against gadhafi degenerate into a dozen separate battles over oil , power and local dominance ?     what happens if gadhafi hangs on ? the president has said he wants u.s. involvement to be brief . but what if gadhafi is fighting on three months from now ?     on the other hand , what happens if gadhafi falls , if he ' s deposed in a palace coup or military coup , or is killed , or flees ? what exactly do we imagine will take his place ?     supporters of u.s. intervention have argued that if we mean to protect libya ' s civilians , as we have declared , then we must force regime change . but in order to remove gadhafi , they add , we will need to do many other things . we will need to provide close-in air power . we will probably have to put in special forces teams to work with the rebels , who are largely untrained and ragtag . the libyan army has tanks and brigades and heavy weapons . the u.s. and the allies will have to provide the rebels training and give them support . they will need antitank missiles and help in coordinating air strikes .     once gadhafi is gone , will there be a need for an international peacekeeping force to stabilize the country , to provide a peaceful transition , and to help the post-gadhafi government restore its infrastructure ? will there be a partition ? will libyan territory be altered ?     none of this sounds like limited and discrete action .     in fact , this may turn out to be true : if gadhafi survives , the crisis will go on and on . if gadhafi falls , the crisis will go on and on .     everyone who supports the libyan endeavor says they don ' t want an occupation . one said the other day , \" we ' re not looking for a protracted occupation . \"     protracted ?     mr. obama has apparently set great store in the fact that he was not acting alone , that britain , france and italy were eager to move . that ' s good \u2014 better to work with friends and act in concert . but it doesn ' t guarantee anything . a multilateral mistake is still a mistake . so far the allied effort has not been marked by good coordination and communication . if the conflict in libya drags on , won ' t there tend to be more fissures , more tension , less commitment and more confusion as to objectives and command structures ? could the unanticipated results of the libya action include new strains , even a new estrangement , among the allies ?     how might gadhafi hit out , in revenge , in his presumed last days , against america and the west ?     and what , finally , about congress ? putting aside the past half-century ' s argument about declarations of war , doesn ' t congress , as representative of the people , have the obvious authority and responsibility to support the libyan endeavor , or not , and to authorize funds , or not ?     these are all big questions , and there are many other obvious ones . if the libya endeavor is motivated solely by humanitarian concerns , then why haven ' t we acted on those concerns recently in other suffering nations ? it ' s a rough old world out there , and there ' s a lot of suffering . what is our thinking going forward ? what are the new rules of the road , if there are new rules ? were we , in libya , making a preemptive strike against extraordinary suffering \u2014 suffering beyond what is inevitable in a civil war ?     america has been through a difficult 10 years , and the burden of proof on the need for u.s. action would be with those who supported intervention . chief among them , of course , is the president , who made the decision as commander in chief . he needs to sit down and tell the american people how this thing can possibly turn out well . he needs to tell them why it isn ' t mad .\n"}]}, "user_id_to_descriptions": {"alice": "Is interested in compiling a summary.", "hannah": "Knows about the following topics:\nObama, Libya, military action, speech, congress"}, "user_id_to_table_names": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_templated": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_lowprecision": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_lowprecision_templated": {}}
