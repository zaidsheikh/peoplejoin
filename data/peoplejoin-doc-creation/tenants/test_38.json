study .     researchers who took a fresh look at previously collected data found people who got flu shots were less likely to have heart problems during the next year than those who were given a fake shot , or placebo . that was especially true for people with recent heart troubles .     \" if there are those out there who for whatever reason don ' t get the flu shot or don ' t feel that they need it \u2026 this is one more reason why they might help , \" dr. jacob udell said .     udell is the study ' s lead author from the university of toronto ' s women ' s college hospital and peter munk cardiac center at toronto general hospital .     previous reports have shown people who come down with the flu have an increased risk over the near term of having a stroke , heart failure and heart disease , he told reuters health .     it ' s thought the infection triggers inflammation throughout the body and can aggravate existing heart problems .     for the new study , the researchers searched several databases for trials that compared people who received the flu shot to others who did not .     they found five published studies and one unpublished study that included 6,735 participants . participants were in their late 60s , on average . a little more than a third had a history of heart problems .     overall , 3 percent of those who received a flu shot went on to have a heart problem including a heart attack or stroke within a year . that compared to about 5 percent of those in the placebo groups .     among those with recent heart disease , the difference was more dramatic .     the researchers found about 10 percent of participants with a recent heart problem went on to have another after they received the flu shot . that compared to about 23 percent in the placebo groups .     \" clearly if you had a recent heart attack our research is showing \u2026 they ' re going to derive the most protection , \" udell said .     \" i think it adds a stronger bit of evidence to the recommendations that are currently being made , \" dr. david frid said .     frid , a preventative cardiologist at the cleveland clinic in ohio , was not involved with the new study .     \" from the clinical perspective , it gives us more supporting data to say to our patients , \u2018here ' s a recent study confirming what we ' ve been telling you that if you have heart disease you should be getting the flu vaccine , ' \" he told reuters health .     dr. kathleen neuzil from the global health nonprofit organization path in seattle wrote an editorial accompanying the new study in the journal of the american medical association .     she cautions that the findings can ' t say the flu shot prevents heart problems . however , neuzil writes that the known complications of flu among older people warrant the vaccine ' s use .     source : bit.ly/jotmp1 the journal of the american medical association , online october 22 , 2013 .\n"}, {"url": "file://test/38/2/0", "title":

physically and flavor-wise ( along with the cheese ) , between the two behemoth chicken filets . and there was a lot of discussion around whether the cheese was really a cheese spread , or if it had just melded with the special sauce.with a complete bite of chicken , cheese , bacon and sauce , this sandwich really isn ' t bad . while we probably wouldn ' t order another ( unless you ' re really

off a case of influenza , and as an added bonus you \u2019 ll reduce your risk of a heart attack , stroke or other type of unpleasant \u201ccardiovascular event , \u201d a new study finds .     for some time , researchers have suspected that flu shots can protect heart health as well as respiratory health . they have tested this theory in a handful of clinical trials , and the results have been mixed .     now an international group of researchers has compiled data from a dozen randomized clinical trials to see if they could get a clearer answer to the question . what they found was \u201ca consistent association between influenza vaccination and a lower risk of cardiovascular events , \u201d according to their report in wednesday \u2019 s edition of the journal of the american medical assn .     five of the trials the team examined were published in peer-reviewed journals and compared a flu vaccine to a placebo vaccine or other type of control . in those trials , 3,238 patients got a real vaccine and 95 of them \u2013 2.9 % \u2013 went on to experience \u201ca major adverse cardiovascular event , \u201d the jama report said . for the sake of comparison , 3,231 patients in those trials got a placebo or control and 151 of them \u2013 or 4.7 % \u2013 later had a cardiovascular event , according to the study .     that translates into a 36 % reduced risk of a serious heart problem simply by getting a flu shot \u2013 something everyone over the age of 6 months should be doing anyway . based on these figures , the researchers calculated that one death or serious illness due to heart trouble could be prevented by vaccinating 58 additional people .     three of the trials the researchers examined focused on patients with coronary artery disease . some of those patients had recently experienced acute coronary syndrome , and they benefited the most by getting a flu shot . patients who got the vaccine were 55 % less likely to have a serious heart problem than patients in the control groups , the researchers found . the team calculated that for these patients , only eight additional people would need to get a flu shot in order to prevent one case of death or serious illness .     when the researchers considered cardiovascular deaths on their own , they found no statistically significant difference between the 1.3 % of people who died after getting a flu shot and the 1.7 % who died after being assigned to a placebo or control group .     experts aren \u2019 t sure why the flu increases the risk of serious heart problems , but they have their theories . it may cause a plaque that has built up inside the arteries to rupture , or it may cause the heart muscle to become inflamed , among other possibilities . knowing what \u2019 s going on inside the body would help figure out who would get an extra boost from a flu shot , and why .     even with those uncertainties , the conclusion that a flu shot can protect patients with heart disease is convincing , according to an editorial that accompanies the study in jama .     \u201cthe estimate of 1.7 major cardiovascular events prevented for every 100 persons with cardiovascular disease vaccinated is plausible and would represent a significant public health benefit , \u201d wrote dr. kathleen neuzil , a vaccine expert at path , a seattle-based nonprofit that focuses on global health .     if you '
