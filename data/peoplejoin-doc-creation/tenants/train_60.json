is emblematic of a growing eviction and rent-hike horror overtaking non-homeowners in san mateo county .     \u201cthey \u2019 re trying to take away everything from me here , \u201d hatch said as she sat in her tidy living room , where fading photos of family gaze down on her collections of tiny ceramic bunnies and kitties . \u201cgee whiz , i don \u2019 t know what i \u2019 ll do if i have to

of their social security checks .     neither of the women can afford a new , more expensive place to live or have relatives they can move in with .     landlord david kantz tells his own version of the turn of events . he says he feels terrible that he is evicting hatch , but the trust left behind by his wife \u2014 the third of the previous landlord women who are now deceased \u2014 expires in july , and he is duty-bound to sell the property on behalf of his two sons .     previous landlord slain     he became the current landlord , he pointed out , when his wife was slain in 2006. the kantzes were getting divorced when pamela kantz , 55 , was killed by her boyfriend , tony mcclung , who is serving an 11-year prison term for voluntary manslaughter .     \u201cwe have come to this unexpected confluence of events , and i am responsible to do the best i can for the beneficiaries \u2014 my sons , \u201d said kantz , who lives in the sierra foothills town of coloma ( el dorado

that his wife \u2019 s grandmother , vivian kruse , told hatch she could stay for life , \u201cbut there \u2019 s no contract . there \u2019 s nothing in my wife \u2019 s will that directs me to do anything other than what is best for the beneficiaries. \u201d     and \u201cbest , \u201d he said , is not hard to determine , at least monetarily . the little century-old house that was bought for a few thousand dollars by his wife \u2019 s ancestors is currently listed on the zillow real estate website at $ 1.2 million .     \u201ci didn \u2019 t want to say , \u2018we \u2019 re going to just throw you out , \u2019 but i thought i would give her plenty of notice , \u201d said kantz , who sent his first letter of eviction intention in early december . \u201cthere is no one part of this whole thing i don \u2019 t feel bad about .     \u201ci feel bad for the elderly lady , i feel bad for my sons , i feel bad for me. \u201d     rents have skyrocketed across the bay area in the past couple of years , but the problem is particularly acute in wealthy san mateo county , which has the second-highest rate of income inequality after marin county , according to the silicon valley institute for regional studies .     a recent study by the san mateo county board of supervisors shows that rent in the county for a two-bedroom unit has increased by a wallet-busting 51 percent over the past four years .     \u2018no protections for anybody \u2019     federal guidelines indicate rent is unaffordable when it exceeds 30 percent of a household \u2019 s income \u2014 which means that in san mateo county , a household must earn at least $ 106,000 to afford the average current monthly rent of $ 2,648 for a two-bedroom unit , according to the county study .     u.s. census data show that about 35 percent of renter families in san mateo county are paying more than 30 percent of their income for housing .     \u201cmarie \u2019 s case is one of the most egregious examples of what \u2019 s going on in this county with renters , \u201d said cindy cornell , 66 , who founded the burlingame advocates for renter protections community group two years ago when her own rent was raised $ 850 a month at a seniors complex . \u201cthere is no rent control here at all . no protections for anybody. \u201d     she is leading an effort to place a measure on the november ballot that would institute rental and eviction safeguards in burlingame , replacing a 1988 law that prohibits rent control in the city .     the severity of the recent rent increases in all of san mateo county , not just burlingame , is compelling rep. jackie speier , d-hillsborough , to hold a town hall meeting on the subject monday night . seats for the 7 p.m. event at st. bartholomew auditorium in the city of san mateo have been booked solid in advance , but the meeting will be broadcast live on peninsula television and streamed at pentv .     meanwhile , hatch \u2019 s neighbor \u2014 also being evicted by kantz , since he owns her home and wants to sell it \u2014 has joined with cornell \u2019 s group to help the woman and her roommate fight the eviction .     legal help     cheryl graczewski , a 43-year-old education policy researcher , connected hatch and rothrock with a legal aid attorney on friday . she said she and her tech-worker husband are fortunate enough to be able to pay higher rent at the place they are moving to in march . \u201cbut for marie , it \u2019 s different , \u201d she said .     \u201cmarie has no money , really , and no real choices , \u201d graczewski said .

they are on the field during the performance but gives them the option to remain in the locker room if they prefer , it was announced wednesday .     the policy subjects teams to a fine if a player or any other team personnel do not show respect for the anthem . that includes any attempt to sit or kneel , as dozens of players have done during the past two seasons to protest racial inequality and police brutality . those teams also will have the option to fine any team personnel , including players , for the infraction .     \" we want people to be respectful of the national anthem , \" commissioner roger goodell said . \" we want people to stand -- that ' s all personnel -- and make sure they treat this moment in a respectful fashion . that ' s something we think we owe . [ but ] we were also very sensitive to give players choices . \"     goodell said the vote was \" unanimous \" among owners , although san francisco 49ers owner jed york said he abstained . york said that all owners that voted in the process supported the change . the policy will be part of the nfl ' s game operations manual and thus not subject to collective bargaining . the nfl players association said in a statement that it will review the policy and \" challenge any aspect \" that is inconsistent with the cba .     some important details remained unclear in the hours after the policy ' s approval , including the specific fine that teams would be subject to and also how the league will define respect for the flag .     \" to make a decision that strong , you would hope that the players have input on it , \" cleveland browns quarterback tyrod taylor said . \" but obviously not . so we have to deal with it as players , for good or a bad thing .     \" i think the main thing out of all of it is that each ballclub is having open communication with the players and ownership about the issues that are going on in the community and trying to change it . \"     nflpa executive director demaurice smith reacted with displeasure in a series of tweets wednesday .     \" history has taught us that both patriotism and protest are like water ; if the force is strong enough it cannot be suppressed . today , the ceo ' s of the nfl created a rule that people who hate autocracies should reject , \" smith tweeted .     \" management has chosen to quash the same freedom of speech that protects someone who wants to salute the flag in an effort to prevent someone who does not wish to do so . the sad irony of this rule is that anyone who wants to express their patriotism is subject to the whim of a person who calls himself an \" owner . \" i know that not all of the nfl ceo ' s are for this and i know that true american patriots are not cheering today . \"     after spending months in discussions , and another three hours over two days at the league ' s spring meetings , owners said this found a compromise that will end sitting or kneeling with an edict that stops short of requiring every player to stand .     the previous policy required players to be on the field for the anthem but said only that they \" should \" stand . when then-san francisco 49ers quarterback colin kaepernick began kneeling in 2016 , the league had no rule it could use to prevent it . the movement drew increasing criticism from president donald trump , as well as many fans , who believed it was a sign of disrespect toward the flag and country .     owners , however , had been divided on how to extricate the league from that criticism . some owners , including the dallas cowboys ' jerry jones and the houston texans ' bob mcnair , wanted all players to stand . others , such as the new york jets ' christopher johnson , wanted to avoid any appearance of muzzling players .     even the seemingly simple option of clearing the field prior to the anthem was rejected by some owners who thought it would be interpreted as a mass protest or at least a sign of disrespect .     earlier this week , the league finalized an $ 89 million social justice platform with players to help address \" some of the underlying issues \" that were under protest , said mark murphy , the green bay packers ' president/ceo .     \" i think we learned from each other in order to come to a unanimous consensus , \" murphy said . \" we also talked a lot about our players . i think when you look back at last fall , it was difficult for all of us within the league . but one of the positives that came out of it was an improved relationship with our players . \"     in a statement accompanying the announcement , goodell said the league wanted to eliminate criticism that suggested the protests were unpatriotic .     \" it was unfortunate that on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of nfl players were unpatriotic , \" goodell said . \" this is not and was never the case . \"     kaepernick and former 49ers safety eric reid have both filed collusion cases against the league after failing to find jobs as free agents .     eagles defensive end chris long tweeted that the policy is \" fear of a diminished bottom line . \" long , who is white , notably kept his hand on african-american teammate malcolm jenkins ' back for the entire playing of the anthem before a 2017 preseason game . long then gave jenkins a pat on the shoulder pads and a hug when the song was over .     \" it ' s also fear of a president turning his base against a corporation . this is not patriotism . don ' t get it confused , \" long tweeted . \" these owners don ' t love america more than the players demonstrating and taking real action to improve . it also lets you , the fan , know where our league stands . \"     jenkins is one of a handful of outspoken players who vowed wednesday to carry on the cause .     \" i will not let it silence me or stop me from fighting , \" he said . \" this has never been about taking a knee , raising a fist or anyone ' s patriotism , but doing what we can to effect real change for real people . \"\n"}, {"url": "file://train/60/1/1", "title": "train/60/1/1", "content": "atlanta ( cnn ) nfl players must stand

potential government shutdown crisis friday , as the house approved by a 219-203 vote a gop-authored short-term funding measure designed to keep the government running through nov. 18 and democrats in the senate immediately vowed to reject the bill .     \u201cwe expect a vote fairly quickly , \u201d said senate majority leader harry reid ( d-nev. ) on friday morning .     in an after-midnight roll call , house republican leaders persuaded conservatives early friday morning to support a stop-gap measure nearly identical to one they had rejected just 30 hours earlier . by a narrow margin , 213 republicans supported the plan , along with six democrats ; 179 democrats opposed it , joined by 24 republicans .     the bill , which will keep federal agencies funded through nov. 18 , passed over staunch objections from house democrats , who opposed a provision that would pair increased funding for disaster relief with a spending cut to a program that makes loans to car companies to encourage energy efficient car production .     but house speaker john boehner \u2019 s ( r-ohio ) victory is likely to be short-lived . reid said late thursday that the measure could not pass his chamber , with a vote expected sometime friday . a senate defeat would leave congress at a new standoff .     \u201cit fails to provide the relief that our fellow americans need as they struggle to rebuild their lives in the wake of floods , wildfires and hurricanes , and it will be rejected by the senate , \u201d reid said of the house bill .     without a resolution , the federal emergency management agency \u2019 s disaster relief fund will run out of money early next week and the rest of the government would be forced to shutdown oct. 1.     house leaders contend that the senate would be responsible for blocking desperately needed disaster dollars from flowing to fema if they reject their bill .     \u201cyou saw the house act , \u201d said house majority leader eric cantor ( r-va. ) as he left the capitol early friday morning . \u201cwe are intending that the money gets to fema and to disaster victims as they need it. \u201d     \u201ci think harry reid \u2019 s political ploy is not going to work , \u201d cantor continued , adding that blame for fema funding drying up if the senate rejects the bill would fall on senate democrats . \u201ci guess harry reid will have to bear the burden of denying disaster victims the money they need. \u201d     friday \u2019 s house vote marked a reversal of fortunes for boehner , who after losing the initial wednesday vote on the house spending resolution found himself roaming the contours of a familiar dilemma \u2014 capitulate to fiscal hawks in his own party who want to spend less , or compromise with democrats who want to spend more .     instead , boehner found another route : he huddled all day and night thursday with his rank-and-file , warning them he would give them one more chance to approve the bill or he would be forced to agree to drop the offsetting cut , as democrats had demanded .     in addition , after a 90-minute meeting with the house gop conference on thursday afternoon , the leadership agreed to an additional , largely symbolic cut by striking $ 100 million from a loan program that funded the bankrupt solar panel manufacturer solyndra . that company , which received the loan guarantees through the obama administration \u2019 s 2009 stimulus legislation , has become a favorite target for republicans in their critique of the white house \u2019 s handling of the economy .     as for the swipe at the program that had funded solyndra , rep. david dreier ( r-calif. ) told colleagues on the house floor late thursday that the goal was to \u201censure that hard-earned dollars of the american people are not wasted in the way that we have seen \u201d with the company .     rep. louise m. slaughter ( d-n.y. ) countered that the measure had hardly changed after a day of wrangling and still made \u201cunacceptable cuts to an essential manufacturing jobs program to pay for equally essential disaster relief. \u201d     the blow-up over what boehner had once hoped would be a routine matter \u2014 a bill to merely keep government operating until nov. 18 \u2014 illustrated what has become a central reality for the republican speaker : he controls the house majority only on paper .     on any given vote , he must contend with a sizable bloc of his own members willing to buck his leadership in the name of shrinking government .     this leaves him in the uncomfortable position of having to consider alliances with democrats \u2014 and facing negotiating those alliances from a position of weakness .     despite the embarrassing loss on wednesday \u2019 s vote , republicans defended the decision to hold the vote even though they realized it was likely to fail . the gop leadership wanted to demonstrate to the recalcitrant conservatives that their actions had real consequences . one senior republican adviser called the process \u201can educational experience. \u201d     \u201ci \u2019 ve always believed in allowing the house to work its will . i understood what the risk was yesterday . but why not put the bill on the floor and let the members speak ? and they did , \u201d boehner said thursday morning at his weekly press briefing .     according to gop lawmakers and aides , house majority whip kevin mccarthy ( r-calif. ) had reported to boehner and cantor that a few dozen republicans would oppose the legislation , mostly because they thought its spending levels were too far above those they voted for in the spring when they approved the 2012 budget originally proposed by house budget committee chairman paul ryan ( r-wis. ) .     boehner \u2019 s leadership team knew that it would need democratic votes to approve the plan , but only by wednesday afternoon did they fully understand that house minority leader nancy pelosi ( d-calif. ) and house minority whip steny h. hoyer ( d-md. ) were whipping their caucus to oppose the measure and make boehner deliver nearly all republican votes for passage . rather than pulling the bill from the floor , boehner told his deputies to hold the vote .     the extraordinary effort required to pass such a basic bill suggests even bigger battles later in the fall on potential blockbuster deficit-reduction plans .     the stopgap spending bill is necessary because the house and senate have stalemated over how to fund government through the whole year . without a stopgap in place to buy time for further negotiations , the government will shut down at month \u2019 s end .     house leaders had hoped to pass the short-term funding bill without the strife that had characterized recent debates , which they knew would erode financial markets \u2019 confidence and spark further disgust among voters . they would do it by agreeing to set spending in the bill at a rate of $ 1.043 trillion for the year , the amount set in the rancorous august deal to raise the nation \u2019 s debt ceiling .     but that plan ran headlong into the political realities of their divided chamber \u2014 as well as a congressional calendar that provides for a week-long recess starting friday so that jewish lawmakers can observe their holidays next week .     democrats , stung by accusations that they had made too many concessions in the debt fight during the summer , stood unified against the measure over a republican decision to pair $ 3.65 billion in funding for disaster relief with a $ 1.5 billion spending cut to the the advanced technology vehicle manufacturing program , which offers loans to car companies to encourage the production of energy-efficient cars . that particular cut was anathema to many democrats , who argued that the loan program has generated tens of thousands of jobs .     democrats relished the prospect that their unified opposition forced boehner to publicly struggle .     \u201cin the house , the majority controls all the mechanisms , \u201d said rep. anna g. eshoo ( d-calif. ) . \u201cyou \u2019 d better be able to produce the votes . you just cant go willy-nilly to the floor and then say , \u2018well , oopsy. \u2019 \u201d     staff writers david a. fahrenthold and felicia sonmez contributed to this report .\n"}, {"url": "file://train/60/2/1", "title": "train/60/2/1", "content": "washington -- the senate voted friday morning to reject the house ' s stopgap spending bill , less than 12 hours after the house ' s republican leaders had forced it through on their second try .     the senate vote was 59 to 36 to table the house bill , effectively killing it . some conservative republicans joined in rejecting the measure .     the house , in the wee hours of friday morning , had passed its latest version of a stopgap spending bill after rejecting on wednesday a nearly identical version of the legislation , which is needed to keep the government open after sept. 30 and to provide assistance to victims of natural disasters . the house vote was 219 to 203.     house republican leaders , trying to recover from a humiliating political defeat , had made one change in the bill -- but it was one that most democrats in the house and senate opposed , trimming green energy loans . the new version would offset more of the cost of disaster assistance by rescinding $ 100 million from an energy department program that guaranteed a loan for solyndra , the solar equipment manufacturer that filed recently for bankruptcy protection .     the bill , to finance government operations for seven weeks after the start of the fiscal year on oct. 1 , had faced problems in the senate , where democrats want to spend more without cutting other programs to offset the cost .     senate democratic leaders had said all along that the house version would be swiftly rejected in the senate , which had already passed a version of its own . indeed , the senators acted even before the house version had formally arrived for their consideration .     \" the house bill is not an honest effort at compromise , \" said the senate majority leader , harry reid , democrat of nevada . \" it fails to provide the relief that our fellow americans need as they struggle to rebuild their lives in the wake of floods , wildfires and hurricanes , and it will be rejected by the senate . \"     mr. reid said he had hoped that house republicans would move toward the middle . \" instead , \" he said , \" they moved even further toward the tea party . \"     it is not clear how the two houses will overcome the impasse and avert a government shutdown . most federal agencies need money to continue operations beyond oct. 1. the disaster relief fund of the federal emergency management agency is running short of money . and lawmakers are planning to leave town for a recess scheduled for next week .     house republican leaders , who lost control of their caucus on wednesday , worked furiously on thursday to round up votes for the revised version of the stopgap bill .     they prevailed by halving the number of defections from their ranks . on wednesday , 48 republicans voted against the bill . on friday , just 24 voted no . representative david dreier , republican of california and chairman of the rules committee , said it had been \" an ugly , messy , difficult process . \" the purpose of the change , he said , was to prevent \" another boondoggle like solyndra . \"     the new version of the house bill , like the original , would have partially offset the cost of disaster assistance by cutting a separate energy department loan program that promotes development of energy-efficient cars . this cut infuriates democrats in the house and the senate , who say the program is creating thousands of jobs at automakers and auto parts suppliers .     \" the bill was wrong yesterday , the bill is wrong today , \" representative louise m. slaughter , democrat of new york , said thursday night on the house floor . \" virtually nothing has changed . \"     the house democratic leader , nancy pelosi of california , said republicans were offering \" the same old warmed-over stew that was rejected \" on wednesday .     speaker john a. boehner had solicited the views of his colleagues at a meeting of the house republican conference , where lawmakers expressed frustration at the setback they suffered wednesday on the bill to provide $ 3.65 billion in disaster relief .\n"}]}, "user_id_to_descriptions":
