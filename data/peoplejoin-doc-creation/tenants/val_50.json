a teenage couple accused of violating the pashtun \u2018code of honour \u2019 killed with electric shocks . the murders executed by family members on the orders of a jirga of elders of the mohmand tribe .     first to fall prey to misconstrued notions of honour was the 15-year-old girl . by the next sunrise , the 17-year-old boy too was no more .     over the next few days , their bodies simply disappeared , buried in the dark of night . there was no mourning , no last rites and no prayers for the departed .     any reader would be forgiven for assuming this brutal tragedy occurred somewhere in the tribal reaches of the country . but this was in karachi , the largest urban centre of pakistan , where the laws of the country apply in full force .     the area where this atrocity played out was ali brohi goth , a locality in the suburbs of karachi that falls with the jurisdiction of the ibrahim hyderi police .     as per information garnered from local residents and police sources , the wheels of tribal \u2018justice \u2019 were set in motion on august 14 , the day the country celebrated 70 years of its existence .     the girl , 15-year-old bakht taj , daughter of hikmat khan , had allegedly attempted to elope with 17-year-old rehman , son of muhammad afzal . both families belong to the safi sub-clan of the mohmand tribe and reside in ali brohi goth .     on independence day , taj disappeared from her house with cash and jewellery . while she stayed at a house in the nearby area of gulshan-e-buner , rehman was to remain at his own home so as to not arouse suspicion .     as taj \u2019 s frantic parents scoured their daughter \u2019 s room for any clue to her whereabouts , they soon found a mobile sim card registered in rehman \u2019 s name . the oversight would prove fatal for the teenage couple as the elders managed to track taj down and brought her home on the same day .     a broken agreement     realising the gravity of the matter , rehman \u2019 s father , afzal , visited taj \u2019 s house to meet her father , hikmat , and extended a marriage proposal . knowing well the possibility of violent retribution from taj \u2019 s family , afzal relied on another archaic tribal practice , swara ( offering girls of the family for marriage ) , to pacify taj \u2019 s parents .     along with promising to give two of his daughters for marriage , afzal offered to bear all the expenses of taj and rehman \u2019 s wedding and also proffered a cow as compensation .     sources who followed the developments told the news that taj \u2019 s family had accepted afzal \u2019 s offer . an agreement was reached between the two families and over a dozen elders of the mohmand tribe residing in ali brohi goth , sherpao colony and muslimabad gathered on august 15 for a jirga to conclude the matter .     it was there that a staunchly conservative elder , sartaj khan alias shagalai , raised objections to the agreement . in his rigid view , the jirga had to punish the teenagers to discourage such acts in the future and their families had to be the ones to kill their children , all to save their and the tribe \u2019 s \u2018honour \u2019 .     murder most foul     shagalai \u2019 s contentions swayed the jirga members and the orders for cold-blooded murder were passed . the adolescents , though , were to die separately .     taj \u2019 s life was taken first . her father and uncle , zar khattab , made her consume a strong sedative and then tied the unconscious girl to a charpoy . she was then administered powerful electric shocks to end her life .     taj was buried that night in secrecy by five tribesmen at the maula madad graveyard in sherpao colony . the next day , rehman \u2019 s family was made to repeat the same harrowing exercise with their own flesh and blood .     rehman \u2019 s father , afzal , had opposed the decision but , according to his relatives , one of the jirga members threatened to have his family in his hometown harmed by taliban militants if he failed to comply .     the law strikes     everyone involved in the barbaric murders tried to keep it a secret . fortunately , though , news of the killings soon reached the authorities .     law enforcers have been conducting raids and the case has been transferred to the shah latif police . sho aman marwat told the news that four people , including afzal and hikmat , had been arrested so far while efforts were afoot to track down the main instigator , sartaj khan alias shagalai . the officer said the victims \u2019 bodies would be exhumed on september 13 for autopsies .     activists working on gender issues and women \u2019 s rights say the practice of killing people over misconstrued notions of honour remains rampant in the country , particularly among pashtun tribesmen .     \u201csuch incidents keep occurring in karachi \u2019 s pashtun-populated localities but due to geographical inaccessibility and an absence of a vibrant civil society in the neighbourhoods , news of these murders often does not make it to the media , \u201d said mahnaz rahman , resident director of women \u2019 s rights body , aurat foundation .\n"},

celebrity mogul whose brash and un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox presidential bid was counted out time and again , became the de facto republican nominee tuesday night after a runaway victory in indiana \u2019 s primary forced his two gop rivals , ted cruz and john kasich , to quit the race .     trump overcame a spirited last stand by cruz \u2014 and a patchwork movement of republicans working desperately to derail him in fear that his polarizing politics could doom the party \u2014 to gallop to the nomination . indiana \u2019 s results positioned him to easily accumulate the 1,237 delegates required to avert a contested convention .     republican national chairman reince priebus declared trump the \u201cpresumptive nominee \u201d and urged all republicans to unite behind him .     cruz dropped out tuesday night in the aftermath of the drubbing , saying he saw no path forward to the nomination . kasich , who won only his home state of ohio , is set to announce his departure from the race later wednesday in columbus .     [ kasich to leave gop race after a sunny campaign in a season of anger ]     sen. ted cruz ( r-tex. ) suspended his presidential campaign may 3 after suffering a stinging loss in the indiana primary to republican presidential front-runner donald trump . ( reuters )     on the democratic side , indiana proved a surprising aberration as bernie sanders scored an upset victory over hillary clinton , giving the vermont senator a needed psychological boost and a fresh rationale to soldier on against increasingly difficult odds .     but sanders \u2019 s success did not change the overall trajectory of the democratic race , which remains strongly in the former secretary of state \u2019 s favor . clinton holds what her campaign and many analysts argue is an irreversible lead in total delegates . although she has not clinched the nomination , she has shifted her focus to a likely general election campaign against trump .     in indiana , a large manufacturing state battered by shifts in the global economy , trump and sanders triumphed on the power of their populist pitches against free trade as well as by channeling the passions of voters who are distrustful of the nation \u2019 s political and economic systems .     as trump claimed the mantle of gop standard-bearer on tuesday night , he was uncharacteristically measured . he remarked on his unlikely journey \u2014 \u201cit \u2019 s been some unbelievable day and evening and year . . . a beautiful thing to behold \u201d \u2014 and promised republicans that he would not let them down . \u201cwe \u2019 re going to win big league , believe me , \u201d he said at trump tower in new york . \u201cwe \u2019 re going after hillary clinton . she will not be a great president . she will not be a good president . she will be a poor president. \u201d     clinton , who campaigned tuesday in the general election battleground of ohio , now has her focus squarely on trump . in a statement acknowledging trump \u2019 s status as presumptive nominee , clinton campaign chairman john podesta said , \u201cthroughout this campaign , donald trump has demonstrated that he \u2019 s too divisive and lacks the temperament to lead our nation and the free world . with so much at stake , donald trump is simply too big of a risk. \u201d     the hoosier state \u2019 s results capped an especially explosive day in the republican race . in a last gasp on tuesday morning , cruz unloaded a litany of personal charges against trump \u2014 a striking shift in tone that conveyed both the texas senator \u2019 s frustrations with his fading fortunes and his freedom to finally speak his mind about the rival he once praised lavishly .     [ the fix \u2019 s winners and losers from indiana primary night ]     republican presidential candidate donald trump held a campaign event at trump tower in manhattan , after sweeping the indiana primary . ( victoria walker/the washington post )     but as trump savored what his family members described as a shocking evening , he strived to be magnanimous in his remarks and singled out cruz for praise . \u201cted cruz \u2014 i don \u2019 t know if he likes me or he doesn \u2019 t like me , but he is one hell of a competitor , \u201d trump said . \u201che is a tough , smart guy . and he has got an amazing future. \u201d     moments earlier , cruz gave an emotional concession speech in indianapolis . flanked by his family and running mate carly fiorina , he said : \u201cwe left it all on the field in indiana . we gave it everything we \u2019 ve got . but the voters chose another path . and so with a heavy heart but with boundless optimism for the long-term future of our nation , we are suspending our campaign. \u201d     in a gop race that began with 17 candidates \u2014 including four sitting governors , four sitting senators and an astoundingly well-funded scion of the bush political dynasty \u2014 it was trump who won over the party \u2019 s most restive and confrontational voters . he looks to california , which awards 172 delegates on june 7 , the final day of primary voting , to make his nomination officially secure .     trump faces an immediate challenge to unify the fractured gop . there are already clear fissures , with republicans mark salter , a former top adviser to sen. john mccain ( r-ariz. ) , and ben howe , an editor of redstate , tweeting \u201ci \u2019 m with her \u201d \u2014 meaning they support clinton .     kasich held no public appearance on tuesday night and scrapped plans to hold a news conference wednesday morning at washington dulles international airport . he will read a statement announcing the end of his campaign at 5 p.m. wednesday , according to senior advisers .     kasich entered the race with an impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 : 18 years in the house , where he built a reputation as a budget cutter ; a stint as a fox news channel host ; and five years as the popular governor of a presidential swing state . he ran as a pragmatic conservative , one had defied his own party and expanded medicaid , the federal health-care program for the poor , in ohio . the message never caught on , and kasich struggled to attract both fundraising and attention .     [ the question of the moment : what will trump be like as gop nominee ? ]     for cruz , the last days of the race in indiana were a painful demonstration that his time had run out . after trump \u2019 s landslide april victories in six consecutive northeast and mid-atlantic primaries , cruz saw indiana as an essential lifeline . his political operation went into overdrive , and he barnstormed indiana as hard as any state since the kickoff iowa caucuses . his allied super pacs spent millions of dollars advertising in the state .     cruz \u2019 s moves over the past week signaled desperation . he struck a nonaggression pact with kasich , who effectively pulled out of indiana to give cruz a one-on-one shot against trump in exchange for cruz ceding coming primaries in oregon and new mexico .     cruz also named fiorina as a running mate , and the two of them hurled fiery insults at trump on the stump . cruz escalated his rhetoric at a news conference tuesday , labeling trump \u201cutterly amoral , \u201d a \u201cserial philanderer \u201d and a \u201cbraggadocious , arrogant buffoon , \u201d among other slurs .     none of it worked . pre-primary polls showed trump the chief beneficiary of the cruz-kasich deal and pulling farther ahead .     [ cruz unloads on trump : a \u2018narcissist at a level i don \u2019 t think this country has ever seen \u2019 ]     trump left nothing to chance . unlike in some earlier contests , his campaign aired television ads and ran a sizable field operation while the candidate kept up a busy schedule of massive rallies . trump toured the state with retired indiana university basketball coach bobby knight .     cruz , meanwhile , was beset by bad luck . the fiorina announcement was overtaken by news that former house speaker john a. boehner ( r-ohio ) had disparaged cruz as \u201clucifer in the flesh. \u201d cruz won a hard-sought endorsement from indiana gov . mike pence , but it drew notice instead for being markedly mealy-mouthed . pro-trump hecklers personally confronted cruz outside one of his events . and fiorina fell off a campaign stage .     cruz \u2019 s frustrations boiled over tuesday . after trump attacked cruz by referring to an unsubstantiated national enquirer story alleging that cruz \u2019 s father , rafael , was connected to president john f. kennedy \u2019 s assassin , cruz unleashed his tirade .     [ gop elites are now resigned to donald trump as their nominee ]     buoying trump , 6 in 10 indiana republican voters \u2014 a larger share than in most previous contests \u2014 said they wanted the next president to come from outside the political establishment , according to preliminary exit polling reported by abc news .     similarly , nearly half of indiana \u2019 s republican voters were supportive of deporting undocumented immigrants , while that figure in earlier contests averaged 41 percent , the data showed . and more republicans said that cruz had run the most unfair campaign than said so of trump , according to the exit polling .     trump neutralized cruz \u2019 s support from demographic groups \u2014 evangelicals , college graduates and voters who describe themselves as very conservative \u2014 that in previous primaries backed the texan heavily , exit polling showed .     on the democratic side , clinton \u2019 s earlier victories were so commanding that she could withstand even a string of lopsided losses in may and still secure the nomination . sanders has pledged to remain in the race until the end , even though his fundraising has slowed considerably and the scale of his political operation has been downsized accordingly .     but sanders told reporters tuesday night that he felt \u201ca great deal of momentum. \u201d     \u201ci sense some great victories coming , \u201d sanders said . \u201cand i think while the path is narrow , and i do not deny that for a moment , i think we can pull off one of the great political upsets in the history of the united states. \u201d     david a. fahrenthold and scott clement in washington ; david weigel in louisville ; and jenna johnson in new york contributed to this report .\n"}, {"url": "file://val/50/0/1", "title": "val/50/0/1", "content": "heidi cruz , wife of republican presidential candidate , sen. ted cruz , r-texas , talks with supporters during a campaign stop at lincoln square pancake house , tuesday , may 3 , 2016 , in westfield , ind .

least 45 delegates for his victory in indiana , putting him on a solid path to clinch the nomination and avoid a contested convention .     there are still 12 delegates left to be allocated .     trump needs to win just 43 percent of the remaining delegates to capture the nomination by the end of the primaries on june 7.     he has won a majority of the delegates allocated so far .     trump ' s rivals , ted cruz and john kasich , have been mathematically eliminated from reaching the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination before the convention . their only hope is to block trump and force a contested convention in which no one arrives with a majority of the delegates .     the ap delegate count :     trump : 1,041.     cruz : 565.     kasich : 152.     ___     7 : 00 p.m.     donald trump has won the republican presidential primary in indiana , continuing his surge toward clinching the gop nomination .     the win for trump is a blow to ted cruz , who will fall further behind the billionaire in the race for the 1,237 delegates needed to claim the republican nomination .     among his supporters tuesday was roger willett , a 51-year-old republican who says he has been a trump supporter since the businessman ' s campaign began .     willett works as a driver escorting oversize truck loads and complained that the economy in rural western indiana offers few prospects , particularly for people just getting out of school . he says he ' s tired of voting for career politicians and called trump \" a working man , for us . \"     ___     5 : 18 p.m.     the economy is weighing heavily on the minds of indiana voters as they cast ballots in their state ' s primary election .     more than 9 in 10 republican primary voters and more than 8 in 10 democratic primary voters are either very or somewhat worried about the economy , according to early results from exit polls conducted for the associated press and television networks by edison research .     asked about some specific economic issues , two-thirds of democratic primary voters say wall street mostly hurts the economy . and they ' re evenly divided over whether trade with other countries mostly helps or hurts the american economy .     ___     5 : 12 p.m.     donald trump and bernie sanders have both attacked their parties ' nomination processes . they ' ve also gone after their opponents for what they say are unfair tactics . but indiana voters on both sides don ' t see much of a fairness gap in the presidential race .     only a third of gop voters say their party ' s nomination process has been unfair , according to early results from exit polls conducted for the associated press and television networks by edison research .     when it comes to tactics , most democratic primary voters don ' t see either sanders or former secretary of state hillary clinton as having attacked the other unfairly .     republican primary voters were about equally likely to say that each of the top two candidates ran the most unfair campaign . four in 10 voters say trump did , while four in 10 say texas sen. ted cruz did .     ___     5 : 04 p.m.     indiana democrats voting in the state ' s primary election say they ' ve been energized by their party ' s nominating process , while most gop voters say their party has been divided by the political sparring among their top candidates .     that ' s according to early results from exit polls conducted for the associated press and television networks by edison research .     three-quarters of indiana democrats in tuesday ' s election say they think the nominating process has energized rather than divided their party . but nearly 6 in 10 republicans say they think their party has been divided by the nominating process .     about 7 in 10 democrats say they ' d be excited or at least optimistic about the presidency of either former secretary of state hillary clinton or vermont sen. bernie sanders .     but only about half of indiana gop voters are excited or even optimistic about billionaire donald trump , texas sen. ted cruz or ohio gov . john kasich becoming president .     still , most gop primary voters say they would probably support trump , cruz or kasich in november .     ___\n"}, {"url": "file://val/50/0/2", "title": "val/50/0/2", "content": "fresh off his victory in indiana , democratic

victory in the hoosier state breaks clinton ' s recent winning streak . but though he won indiana , the state ' s democratic primary allocates delegates proportionally , so he will barely make a dent

pledged delegate and sway more superdelegates to his side to reach that threshold .     on tuesday night , sanders said he will continue to \" make the case \" to the superdelegates that reside in states where he claimed resounding victories .     \" i believe we \u2019 ll be able to make the case to many of those superdelegates that what is most important is not whether hillary clinton or

residential customers in dozens of cities across the country , according to a study released on monday .         the study , conducted by internet activists battleforthenet , looked at the results from 300,000 internet users and found significant degradations on the networks of the five largest internet service providers ( isps ) , representing 75 % of all wireline households across the us .     the findings come weeks after the federal communications commission introduced new rules meant to protect \u201cnet neutrality \u201d \u2013 the principle that all data is equal online \u2013 and keep isps from holding traffic speeds for ransom .     tim karr of free press , one of the groups that makes up battleforthenet , said the finding show isps are not providing content to users at the speeds they \u2019 re paying for .     \u201cfor too long , internet access providers and their lobbyists have characterized net neutrality protections as a solution in search of a problem , \u201d said karr . \u201cdata compiled using the internet health test show us otherwise \u2013 that there is widespread and systemic abuse across the network . the irony is that this trove of evidence is becoming public just as many in congress are trying to strip away the open internet protections that would prevent such bad behavior. \u201d     the study , supported by the technologists at open technology institute \u2019 s m-lab , examines the comparative speeds of content delivery networks ( cdns ) , which shoulder some of the data load for popular websites . any site that becomes popular enough has to pay a cdn to carry its content on a network of servers around the country ( or the world ) so that the material is close to the people who want to access it .     in atlanta , for example , comcast provided hourly median download speeds over a cdn called gtt of 21.4 megabits per second at 7pm throughout the month of may . at&t provided speeds over the same network of \u2155 of a megabit per second . when a network sends more than twice the traffic it receives , that network is required by at&t to pay for the privilege . when quizzed about slow speeds on gtt , at&t told ars technica earlier this year that it wouldn \u2019 t upgrade capacity to a cdn that saw that much outgoing traffic until it saw some money from that network ( as distinct from the money it sees from consumers ) .     at&t has strongly opposed regulation of its agreements with the companies that directly provide connectivity between high-traffic internet users and their customers . cogent , level3 and others have petitioned the fcc to make free interconnection to cdns a part of the conditions for the proposed merger between at&t and directv .     \u201cit would be unprecedented and unjustified to force at&t to provide free backbone services to other backbone carriers and edge providers , as cogent et al seek , \u201d said the company in a filing replying to the cdns \u2019 suggestion , part of a brief opposing the merger . \u201cnor is there any basis for requiring at&t to augment network capacity for free and without any limits . opponents \u2019 proposals would shift the costs of their services onto all at&t subscribers , many of whom do not use opponents \u2019 services , and would harm consumers. \u201d     fcc chairman tom wheeler has taken an aggressive regulatory tack when it comes to mergers in the telecommunications sector . \u201chistory proves that absent competition a predominant position in the market such as yours creates economic incentives to use that market power to protect your traditional business in a way that is ultimately harmful to consumers , \u201d he told industry leaders at the internet and television expo last month .     the dispute over traffic speeds comes as the telecoms and cable industry readies legal challenges to the net neutrality rules . most telecoms are content letting their lobbyists , notably trade associations cellular telecommunications industry association ( ctia ) and ustelecom , sue the fcc over net neutrality rules , but at&t has been one of the few companies to sue the fcc directly .\n"}]},
