thursday by the pew research center .     but that doesn ' t mean women are waiting for the right moment : the study also found that half of mothers surveyed said parenthood \" just happened . \"     while most women giving birth are doing it within the context of marriage , researchers said a record 41 percent of births were to unmarried women in 2008. that ' s up from 28 percent in 1990 , according to the study , \" the new demography of american motherhood . \" the trend crossed major racial and ethnic groups .     nearly 14 percent of mothers of newborns were 35 or older two years ago _ and only about 10 percent were in their teens . the age trend was reversed in 1990 , when teens had a 13 percent share of births .     \" i think everyone will welcome a decline in births to teens , \" said d ' vera cohn , a senior writer on the study . \" it ' s notable that the population of teens is larger than it used to be , so there were more who could have become teen mothers . \"     today , one in seven babies is born to a mother at least 35 years old . in 1990 , one in 11 had a mother in that age group .     most mothers of newborns ( 54 percent ) had at least some college education in 2008 , an increase from 41 percent in 1990. among mothers 35 or older , 71 percent had at least some college education .     improvements in medical care and fertility treatment , along with marriage and childbearing postponed to seek additional education , all factor into the shifts .     \" the rise in women ' s education levels has changed the profile of the typical mother of a newborn baby , \" the report said . cohn added that a lower share of mothers ended their education after high school , \" so some of those mothers who would have been high school graduates in 1990 have some college education today . \"     the report is based on data from the national center for health statistics and the u.s. census bureau , along with a telephone survey in april 2009 of about 1,000 parents , likely parents and other adults of both genders .     overall , there were 4.3 million births in the u.s. in 2008 , compared with 4.2 million in 1990. the number had risen each year from 2003 to 2007 , then dipped in an apparent link to the economic downturn , the researchers said .     when american parents are asked why they decided to have a child , most cite \" the joy of having children , \" the study said . for nearly half of parents , though , an important explanation is : \" it wasn ' t a decision ; it just happened . \"     women surveyed were more likely than men to cite \" it just happened \" as somewhat or very important in their decision to give birth the first time .     stephanie coontz , director of research and public education for the nonprofit council on contemporary families and a writer who teaches history and family studies at the evergreen state college in olympia , wash. , said the rise of single motherhood is significant .     \" it ' s yet another nail in the coffin in the hope that we can solve the challenges facing us today by shoehorning everyone back into marriages , \" she said . \" one of the big problems with that at this point is very often kids do worse if their mother rushes into a marriage that may be unstable . \"     multiple births associated with the trend toward older motherhood were up sharply , including a 70 percent increase in the twin birth rate from 1980 to 2004.     \" not only are women in their 30s more likely than younger women to conceive multiples on their own , they also are more likely to undergo fertility treatments , which are linked to births of multiples , \" the researchers said .\n"}], "cassie": [{"url": "file://test/62/0/2", "title": "test/62/0/2", "content": "these crawls are

new study released thursday .     the pew research center , citing census and government health statistics , said the trend toward mothers who are older and better educated cuts across all ethnicities in the united states .     between 1990 and 2008 , the number of births to mothers older than 35 leapt from 368,000 to 603,000. one in seven babies -- or 14 percent of a total of about 4 million births -- were born to older mothers in 2008. almost one in four were first-time mothers . the vast majority , 71 percent , had at least some college education before giving birth .     by contrast , births to women younger than 20 declined from 533,000 in 1990 to 441,000 in 2008 , or one in 10 babies . the teenage birthrate has declined steadily since 1990 , except for a spike in 2006 and 2007.     the statistics reflect far-reaching changes for women in society , affecting their decisions on when to marry and start families . the average age for marriage has been rising , as has the share of women who have attended college . women with more education often delay marriage and childbearing while they complete their schooling and establish careers .     the average age at which women have their first child is 25 , a year older than in 1990.     \" it ' s clear that young adult transitions are being postponed , \" said suzanne bianchi , a sociologist at ucla . \" children born to highly educated mothers increasingly are born later in life . the mothers are usually married , and they have a much higher chance of raising children in a stable marriage that lasts through a child ' s childhood . \"     the delay in getting married also helps explain two seemingly contradictory trends . the number of unwed mothers has risen sharply in the united states , so that about four out of every 10 births are to unmarried women , which includes most births to women in their early 20s . at the same time , there has been an increase in the number of women who have never had children .     experts say some of that may be by choice , and some of it is timing .     \" we ' re trained to think science can solve all fertility problems , \" said wendy manning , a sociologist at bowling green state university , who teaches a class in fertility and family planning . \" in fact , there are quite a few limitations . \"     the pew report included a survey on american attitudes toward parenthood that suggests there is less stigma attached to older mothers than once was common . about one in three disapproved of women having babies after age 40 , undergoing fertility treatment or remaining childless ; the rest said those were good things or made no difference to society .     maria bachman , 42 , who runs the web site mothersover35.com from her home outside tucson , said actresses like sandra bullock and nicole kidman , who are older mothers , have helped create a positive image of women who have children at the onset of middle age .     \" when they ' re put on the cover of magazines , they ' re showing it ' s not too late to be an older mom , \" said bachman , who was 37 when she had her first child and 40 when she had her second . \" in fact , older moms are considered sexy . \"     when asked why they decided to have their first child , 87 percent of the parents in the pew survey answered , \" the joy of having children . \" but nearly half said , \"
