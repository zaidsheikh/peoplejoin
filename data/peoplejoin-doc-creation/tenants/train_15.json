two-year moratorium on any new laws , rules or regulations governing the internet . \"     \" together , we can make washington take a break from messing w/ the internet , \" issa said on reddit ,

which would seek to protect u.s. copyrights and trademarks from infringement by foreign websites .     initial reaction on reddit to his proposed moratorium was mixed . some users were confused about what point issa was trying to make , while others saw the move as a stunt .     \" i have a problem with legislation that preemptively ties your hands for years at a time . you can ' t know what the internet or society will look like in six months , let alone two years , and making it harder to respond to emerging threats or opportunities is an abdication of your responsibilities as a member of congress , \" wrote one reddit user . \" this just seems to me to be more cheap political theater , along the lines of grover norquist ' s ' we will never ever ever raise taxes for any reason ' pledge . \"     \" the answer is not to ban new regulation . we need regulation , \" another said . \" but , i don ' t believe anybody in congress has the vocabulary , is intelligent in knowing how the

congressman introduced the bill , a spokesman for issa told cnn , \" after sopa and pipa ( the senate ' s similar protect intellectual property act ) , it became very clear that we needed a

( many of the u.s. marshals \u2019 15 most wanted have been on the lam for a very long time , such as raymond abbott-baerga , who escaped a maximum-security prison , amid a hail of gunfire , in 1992. )     as with so many criminal-justice issues in the news this year , there aren \u2019 t reliable , comprehensive statistics on prison escapes . but richard culp , a professor at the john jay college of criminal justice , surveyed the available data in 2005 and came up with some useful context . combing various calculations and data sets , culp calculated that about three-quarters of all escaped inmates were recaptured . break those numbers out and the figures get even less favorable for matt and sweat : more than 92 percent of fugitives from medium- and high-security prisons were captured within a year ( compared to less than 70 percent of work-release escapees ) . and that estimate is conservative .     monday \u2019 s discovery of dna belonging to both men in a cabin only about 25 miles from the prison \u2014 dna seemingly just a few days old \u2014 suggests that police may be getting closer to them . that \u2019 s very different from having the two men in hand . but statistics on prison escapees suggest that sweat and matt will have a very hard time avoiding recapture \u2014 though if they make it past the first month , their odds seem to improve .     for days after richard matt and david sweat \u2019 s june 6 escape from the clinton correctional facility in dannemora , new york , there seemed to be little concrete evidence of where they were . reports had them heading toward vermont or perhaps canada . then they were thought to be near the pennsylvania border . as hundreds of law enforcement officers combed through roads and fields and forests , matt and sweat stayed out of sight .     in a separate 2005 paper , culp and elizabeth bracco looked at how quickly escapees were captured , and found that most were snagged within the first 24 hours after escape . nine out of 10 of those who were caught were collared within the first month :     time until prison escapees were captured     time of capture frequency percentage cumulative within 1 hour 7 9.6 9.6 within 1 day 36 49.3 58.9 within 1 week 15 20.5 79.4 within 1 month 6 8.2 87.6     data : culp and bracco . created with the html table generator     chuck jordan , president of the national association of fugitive recovery agents , estimated the magic number for escapees as being six months . after that , he said , \u201cthe fugitive has had a chance to acclimate to life on the run , establish a life somewhere , or establish a low profile . the long-term fugitive , who \u2019 s on the run for years \u2014 they tend to settle down . some of these people have become well-regarded in the communities where they \u2019 re at. \u201d sometimes they get brazen : jordan had heard of a fugitive who was caught after more than 20 years when he ran for local city council . and jordan noted that law-enforcement agents had an edge over those who pursue a typical bail-jumper , since authorities knew within hours of the escape that matt and sweat were missing .     more successful escapes are rare , but not unheard of . in may , an akron , ohio , man made headlines after he was captured by u.s. marshals in florida . frank freshwaters , who was 79 , had escaped a prison farm in sandusky in 1959 and managed to elude capture for decades .     just how common is escape from prison ? the associated press set out to figure out how many escapees there are on the loose right now and struggled to fully resolve the question . as its report noted , the bureau of justice statistics tallies about 2,000 escapees in 2013 , but some of those are people who left minimum-security prisons or disappeared while on work release . the ap surveyed states and came up 224 escapees ; that number is incomplete , but also includes some fugitives who are almost certainly dead by now . if that 2,000 number is right , it \u2019 s a serious decline from the 1990s . for 1997 , for example , culp found estimates ranging from 4,500 to 8,500.     in one particularly humiliating case , an inmate who was enlisted to role-play an escapee during a dog-training exercise slipped away .     in some ways , sweat and matt are atypical fugitives . not only have they been on the lam much longer than average , but most escapees are not violent offenders ( both the new york escapees are murderers ) ; matt is older than the typical escapee ; and of course , it \u2019 s very difficult to escape from a maximum-security prison . like most escapees , however , both are white and male .     often , escapees depend on finding and exploiting weaknesses in staffing at a facility , as matt and sweat seem to have done . ( culp records one particularly humiliating case for authorities in which an inmate who was enlisted to role-play an escapee during a dog-training exercise slipped away. ) but few escapes involve a sophisticated plan , as matt and sweat \u2019 s did , and few depend on the assistance of corrections staff , as they allegedly did by relying on joyce mitchell .     now , however , matt and sweat may be out on their own , while hundreds of police with night-vision binoculars , dogs , and helicopters scour new york for them . chuck jordan said he didn \u2019 t expect them to escape the cops permanently . \u201cthey \u2019 ve got to be lucky every day , and law enforcement only has to get lucky once , \u201d he said . \u201ctheir time is going to run out. \u201d\n"}, {"url": "file://train/15/2/0", "title": "train/15/2/0", "content": "issa looks to ban internet regulations     by brendan sasso -     rep. darrell issa ( r-calif. ) is seeking input on a bill that would impose a two-year ban on new laws or regulations that affect the internet .     issa released a draft of his internet american moratorium act on monday night and said that he would answer questions about the legislation on reddit , a social news and discussion site , on wednesday morning .     the one-page draft bill would prohibit congress and all regulatory agencies from enacting rules that affect the internet for two years , with an exception for national security emergencies .         many reddit users are fierce defenders of internet freedom , and the site helped organize opposition to the stop online piracy act ( sopa ) earlier this year . issa , a member of the house judiciary committee , was one of the leading opponents of the controversial anti-piracy legislation .     but gigi sohn , president of consumer advocacy group public knowledge , explained that issa ' s bill would not actually prevent congress from passing laws like sopa .     \" even if they pass this bill , congress could pass another internet regulation bill that would supersede the previous bill , \" sohn said .     issa ' s bill would , however , prevent regulatory agencies , such as the federal communications commission ( fcc ) , from adopting new rules that affect the internet .     sohn warned that prohibiting all government regulation of the internet would \" throw the internet into corporate hands . \"     most democrats support the fcc ' s net neutrality rules , which prohibit internet service providers from slowing down or blocking legitimate websites . supporters say the rules are critical for ensuring an open and free internet .     but issa and other republicans argue that net neutrality is an unnecessary burden on businesses .     sohn noted that issa ' s bill wouldn ' t stop the net neutrality rules since the fcc already enacted them , but the bill could block other potential regulations , such as rules on broadband caps .     the fcc isn ' t drafting any rules on broadband caps , but sohn and other consumer advocates argue the agency should investigate whether providers should be allowed to limit their customers ' internet usage .     sohn said issa ' s bill could also block future regulations on internet privacy . the federal trade commission is currently working on an update to the children ' s online privacy protection act ( coppa ) , which restricts the ability of websites to collect information from children younger than 13.     sohn said that depending on how broadly the courts interpret the definition of the \" internet , \" the bill could also derail efforts to provide more radio frequencies for cellphone service providers , which are struggling to keep pace with the booming demands placed on their networks by smartphones and tablet computers .     \" this bill could have unintended consequences that even its proponents would not be happy with , \" sohn said .     the bill might also prevent the president from issuing an executive order on cybersecurity . president obama is considering an executive order to pressure owners of \" critical infrastructure \" to meet cybersecurity standards after the senate failed to pass legislation on the issue .     a spokesman for issa said the draft bill is not about trying to block any particular regulation , like net neutrality . instead , the measure is intended to start a discussion about the appropriate role of the government in overseeing the internet , the spokesman explained .     he added that issa hopes to formally introduce a more detailed version of the bill next year after reviewing responses on reddit and on his own site for discussing legislation , project madison .     sohn said that while she has serious concerns with the measure , she agrees that it could be a \" good conversation starter . \"\n"}, {"url": "file://train/15/2/2", "title": "train/15/2/2", "content": "please enable cookies on your web browser in order to continue .     the new
