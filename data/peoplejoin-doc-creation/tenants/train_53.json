national parks as he lay severely injured for six days .     but he said the thought only crossed his mind a few times . the 33-year-old experienced hiker , rock climber and rafting guide was determined to live -- and he did .     from a wheelchair tuesday at community regional medical center in fresno , hein talked about breaking his leg on july 5 , hiking down from 13,600-foot mount goddard , and his eventual rescue thursday by a national park service helicopter .     hiking down the mountain , he dislodged a boulder that plowed into the back of his right calf , breaking bones in three spots . the impact forced bone to protrude about an inch and a half through the skin , hein said .     his foot was soon \" dangling , \" hein said . \" i had to grab it so hopefully it wouldn ' t rip off . \"     after sliding down several ice fields , he was without food for six days -- except for a few crickets and moths -- but he managed to drink a little melted ice and later , from a stream .     rescue crews starting combing the high sierra on wednesday , the day hein ' s dad , doug hein , called the fresno county sheriff ' s office . gregory hein had been expected home two days earlier .     \" i can ' t commend them enough for the efforts and the energies that they put out to try and save one person ' s life , \" gregg hein said of the rescue teams from fresno county and the park service -- about 80 people in all -- who helped look for him .     hein said tuesday he has at least two more surgeries on his right leg to combat infection and repair bones , and that he could be in the hospital into next week . the eventual goal is to install a metal rod into his calf .     hein has family ties to clovis unified : his mother is randy hein , principal of temperance-kutner elementary school , and his grandfather is floyd \" doc \" buchanan , former longtime district superintendent .     hein ' s perilous trek began july 3. he parked his car at florence lake in fresno county and within two days , had hiked alone more than 20 miles -- much of it cross-country -- to the summit of mount goddard . after summiting on july 5 , he hoped to make it to blayney hot springs that evening , but the goal was soon shattered with his leg .     hein wasn ' t due home until july 7 , and he said he realized he had at least three days to survive before anyone would start looking for him .     in an attempt to avoid potential rockfall , and knowing he had to get further down the mountain to find help , hein left his backpack on the side of mount goddard . he grabbed only a few things from the pack : a poncho , pocket knife , cords , whistle and a bivvy sack -- a small , lightweight shelter .     he didn ' t take more because he miscalculated , believing he was closer to evolution valley , where he hoped he ' d see hikers .     as he lay bleeding , hein contemplated applying a makeshift tourniquet , a device used to tightly clench blood vessels connected to an injury .     it was a big decision : if he did , \" i would have lost a limb . \"     by the time night fell , hein wasn ' t feeling light-headed . so he took a chance and didn ' t cinch his leg . by the next morning , the bleeding had slowed significantly .     for four days , he lay near the edge of a small glacier , nursing his injury with ice .     hein stabilized his leg with hiking poles , wrapping them with a belt and some cord , and on wednesday , headed for davis lake -- crawling about a mile and dropping about 1,000 feet . he hoped the new location might increase his chance of being found .     on thursday , he saw helicopters -- but they didn ' t see him . two flew over him several times , he said . \" it was kind of wrenching . \"     but around 7 : 30 p.m. thursday , a park service helicopter landed about 50 feet from him at davis lake . the pilot was dropping off a search-and-rescue crew in the area when hein came into view .     after seeing the crew spot him , \" i laid down on my back for a while , and breathed a deep sigh of relief . \"     alive and safe at community regional medical center , hein has a lot to look forward to . he just finished his undergraduate degree in environmental studies at humboldt state and hopes to attend the san joaquin college of law in clovis .     the next time hein treks into the wilderness -- which he says will \" definitely \" happen again -- he plans to be \" more cautious about my own life . \" in the future , hein plans to carry a reflective mirror , which can be used to signal rescue aircraft ; a satellite-linked device , which can be used to alert rescuers about a location ; and more medical supplies and gear .     hein said backpackers should also apply for a wilderness permit so there is documentation of a proposed route , and make sure loved ones are aware of that route , too .     as for hein ' s parents , there ' s just a \" lot of relief \" to see their son \" alive , breathing , talking . \"     \" i ' ve been amazed at the outpouring of support from friends and family , \" father doug hein said . \" it took a huge team , not just the searchers , but the prayer network , that helped bring him back . \"     the reporter can be reached at ( 559 ) 441-6386 , cgeorge@fresnobee.com or @carmengeorge on twitter .\n"}], "parker": [{"url": "file://train/53/1/1",
