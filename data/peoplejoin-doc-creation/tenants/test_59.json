capitol ahead of the inauguration of president trump on jan. 20 . ( bill o \u2019 leary / the washington post )     on the morning after donald trump \u2019 s inauguration , acting national park service director michael t. reynolds received an extraordinary summons : the new president wanted to talk to him .     in a saturday phone call , trump personally ordered reynolds to produce additional photographs of the previous day \u2019 s crowds on the mall , according to three individuals who have knowledge of the conversation . the president believed that the photos might prove that the media had lied in reporting that attendance had been no better than average .     trump also expressed anger over a retweet sent from the agency \u2019 s account , in which side-by-side photographs showed far fewer people at his swearing-in than had shown up to see barack obama \u2019 s inauguration in 2009.     according to one account , reynolds had been contacted by the white house and given a phone number to call . when he dialed it , he was told to hold for the president .     for trump , who sees himself and his achievements in superlative terms , the inauguration \u2019 s crowd size has been a source of grievance that he appears unable to put behind him . it is a measure of his fixation on the issue that he would devote part of his first morning in office to it \u2014 and that he would take out his frustrations on an acting park service director .     ( the washington post )     word rapidly spread through the agency and washington . the individuals who informed the washington post about the call did so on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the conversation .     neither reynolds nor the park service would talk about it .     \u201cthe national park service does not comment on internal conversations among administration officials , \u201d agency spokesman thomas crosson said .     white house deputy press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said the call simply demonstrated that trump \u2019 s management style is to be \u201cso accessible , and constantly in touch. \u201d     \u201che \u2019 s not somebody who sits around and waits . he takes action and gets things done , \u201d sanders said . \u201cthat \u2019 s one of the reasons that he is president today , and hillary clinton isn \u2019 t. \u201d     on saturday , the same day trump spoke with reynolds , the new president used an appearance at cia headquarters to deliver a blistering attack on the media for reporting that large swaths of the mall were nearly empty during the event .     \u201cit \u2019 s a lie , \u201d trump said . \u201cwe caught [ the media ] . we caught them in a beauty. \u201d     1 of 109 full screen autoplay close skip ad \u00d7 the scene in washington on inauguration day view photos trump supporters and protesters gather in the capital as a new presidency begins . caption trump supporters and protesters gather in the capital as a new presidency begins . jan. 20 , 2017 keilaun wilson of columbia , s.c. , sells t-shirts to trump supporters leaving parties . sarah l. voisin/the washington post buy photo wait 1 second to continue .     \u201cit looked like a million , a million and a half people , \u201d trump said , vastly inflating what the available evidence suggested .     [ federal agencies ordered to restrict their communications ]     later that day , white house press secretary sean spicer reiterated trump \u2019 s complaints about media coverage of the crowd in a tongue-lashing from the lectern of the briefing room .     \u201cthese attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong , \u201d spicer said .     the park service does not release crowd estimates . experts , however , have estimated that the 2017 turnout was no more than a third the size of obama \u2019 s eight years earlier .     reynolds was taken aback by trump \u2019 s request , but he did secure some additional aerial photographs and forwarded them to the white house through normal channels in the interior department , the people who notified the post said . the photos , however , did not prove trump \u2019 s contention that the crowd size was upward of 1 million .     reynolds , who had served as the park service \u2019 s deputy director of operations for six months before assuming the post of acting director , is a third-generation employee who has worked there for more than 30 years . as deputy director , he oversaw the park service \u2019 s $ 2.8 billion budget and more than 22,000 employees .     in the days since trump \u2019 s election , the park service has become an unlikely protagonist in a battle between the new president and some career government employees .     the trouble began late friday , when the agency \u2019 s official twitter account retweeted two messages that could be perceived as critical of the new administration : the one comparing the relative crowd size for trump \u2019 s inauguration to that of obama \u2019 s 2009 swearing-in , and another that noted policy pages that had been removed from the white house \u2019 s website .     that prompted an \u201curgent directive \u201d to interior employees that they \u201cshut down twitter platforms immediately until further notice , \u201d which was lifted early saturday morning . crosson then apologized on twitter for \u201cmistaken rts from our account. \u201d     on tuesday , the badlands national park \u2019 s twitter account became a social-media sensation when it posted four tweets in a row about rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and the threats posed by climate change .     those tweets were then deleted . an nps official later explained that badlands nps officials learned they were posted by a former employee who still had access to the account , and decided to remove them .     [ interior department reactivates twitter accounts after shutdown following inauguration ]     spicer told reporters this week that white house officials had not dictated any agency to impose new restrictions on public communications and that some federal officials , such as those at the park service , were not in compliance with their own department \u2019 s policies .     trump , meanwhile , has continued to press the argument that the media has given a misleading account of the crowds that attended his inauguration .     \u201ci had a massive amount of people here , \u201d the president told abc news anchor david muir in an interview wednesday . \u201cthey were showing pictures that were very unflattering , as unflattering \u2014 from certain angles \u2014 that were taken early and lots of other things. \u201d     as he guided muir through the west wing , trump paused at a photo on the wall , taken from behind him as he delivered his inaugural address : \u201chere \u2019 s a picture of the event . here \u2019 s a picture of the crowd . now , the audience was the biggest ever , but this crowd was massive . look how far back it goes . this crowd was massive. \u201d     brady dennis and lisa rein contributed to this report .\n"}], "dewei": [], "eden": [], "bhushan": [{"url": "file://test/59/2/0", "title": "test/59/2/0", "content": "scott weiland will filed ... ex-wife wants to call the shots     scott weiland will filed ... ex-wife wants to call the shots     exclusive     the woman scott weiland divorced nearly 9 years ago , and often battled over his drug use , is asking the courts to name her the executor of his will ... tmz has learned .     mary forsberg filed docs in l.a. saying scott himself named her as executor , and she ' s filed a will with his signature as proof . here ' s the catch ... the will was written in april 2007. that ' s right around the time scott and mary ' s marriage was falling apart , and when he was in the throes of addiction .     mary wrote a memoir called ' fall to pieces ' about life with scott and his battles with drugs .     the docs say scott had about $ 2 million in assets as part of his estate . he also created a trust during his lifetime that has undisclosed assets .     scott ' s widow jamie wachtel was with him for 2 years before his death , and could still contest forsberg ' s filing .\n"}], "parker": [{"url": "file://test/59/1/1", "title": "test/59/1/1", "content": "archaeologists with the university of leicester uncovered remains of two skeletons holding hands believed to have been resting that way for at least 700 years .     university of leicester archaeological services has so far excavated 11 skeletons , dated to the 14th century by radiocarbon , under the \" lost chapel of st. morell , \" which overlooks the small village of hallaton in leicestershire , england .     ulas     the archaeologists , who said there are likely to be more skeletons in the ground , were not certain why the people were buried there rather than in the main church in the village . they said it was possibly a special place of burial for pilgrims .     ulas     among the other skeletons was an older male apparently killed by a sharp implement , such as a pole axe , to the head , according to vicki score , project manager for university of leicester archaeological services . a young male was buried in a pit with his legs raised to his chest , which archaeologists said was possibly the result of a disease , she said .\n"}]}, "user_id_to_descriptions": {"alice": "Is interested in compiling a summary.", "hannah": "Knows about the following topics:\nDonald Trump, inauguration, crowd size, National Park Service, Barack Obama", "cassie": "Knows about the following topics:\nancient skeletons, chapel of st morrell, hallaton fieldwork group, archaeologist vicky score, university of leicester", "farshid": "Knows about the following topics:\nTrump, inauguration, crowd size, National Park Service, Michael T.
