( others credit abraham lincoln , who once spared a turkey destined for christmas dinner when his son tad pleaded for mercy , but that clearly didn ' t catch on for decades. )     ronald reagan was technically the first president to \" pardon \" a thanksgiving turkey , in 1987 \u2014 but he did it as a joke to distract the press from scandal . reporters had been hounding the president about whether he planned to grant pardons to key iran-contra figures like oliver north and john poindexter . reagan merely quipped that he would have pardoned that year ' s turkey had it not been en route to a petting zoo already .     two years later , in 1989 , reagan ' s successor george h.w . bush made the turkey pardon an annual ritual . but it all started as a glib one-liner meant to deflect attention away from white house lawbreaking . hardly a sacred convention .     -- the pardoned turkeys aren ' t that much better off \u2014 because the life of a turkey is misery and pain . this is going to get gruesome , and i ' m sorry about that . but modern-day domestic turkeys aren ' t bred to have a happy life . they ' re raised to be as large as possible so that they can be slaughtered as soon as possible and produce the greatest volume of delicious turkey meat .     some fun facts : turkeys bred for eating now grow to an average of 30 pounds \u2014 much bigger than wild turkeys . * ( the two turkeys on their way to the white house are over 37 pounds apiece. ) these domesticated turkeys are often so fat that their skeletons are unable to support that weight . they frequently develop bone deformities and degenerative joint diseases . they ' re incapable of breeding on their own . they often suffer heart failure or bleeding around the kidneys .     so it ' s no coincidence that , as us news &amp; world report and national journal have discovered , most pardoned turkeys die within a year of being granted a reprieve anyway . the white house wants us to believe these turkeys are living out a life of leisure on the farm and bopping along to their favorite lady gaga tracks . not so :     for the record , i ' m not opposed to raising turkeys for food ( and , yes , it ' s possible to get humanely raised turkeys ) . but it ' s not clear why we need an elaborate white house ceremony designed to obscure where that food actually comes from .     -- it ' s a mockery of the presidential pardon , which is an all-too neglected issue . maybe this isn ' t surprising , since the turkey pardon was basically invented as a way of mocking presidential pardons . still , it ' s worth mentioning .     after tomorrow , obama will have \" pardoned \" 10 turkeys in all ( turkeys that , as best we can tell , haven ' t actually committed any crimes ) . by contrast , he will have only pardoned or commuted the sentences of 40 actual living human beings .     the latter is a record low for modern-day presidents . at the same point in his presidency , ronald reagan had pardoned 313 people . harry truman had pardoned 1,537 people :     last year , sam morrison , an official who spent 13 years in the justice department ' s office of the pardon attorney before retiring in 2010 , described the prevailing attitude toward pardons this way : \" they tend to view any grant of clemency not as a good thing , as a criminal justice success story , but almost as a defeat \u2014 that you ' re taking away something from what some good prosecutor achieved . \" ( the justice department disputed this characterization. )     over at national journal , ron fournier pointed out that , at the bare minimum , obama could grant clemency to all the people still serving extra time in prison under the old crack-sentencing guidelines \u2014 guidelines that obama himself opposed as excessive and which congress reduced for all new prisoners in 2010. so far , however , there ' s no sign that the white house will do this .     the white house does , however , have a flashy web site up letting you vote on your favorite soon-to-be-pardoned turkey . yes , there are hashtags .     * fixed the weight numbers .\n"}, {"url": "file://val/15/1/2", "title": "val/15/1/2", "content": "rio de
