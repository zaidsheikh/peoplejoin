( photo : charles leclaire , usa today sports )     cleveland \u2014 it no longer defies imagination , but assaults the senses , wondering how sheer and utter fantasy could become reality .     how in the world could a baseball player spend six months just learning to walk again after a devastating knee injury , not playing in a single game , and lead the chicago cubs to their first world series victory since 1945 , with a 5-1 victory over the cleveland indians , evening the series at 1-game apiece ?     \" it \u2019 s the ' legend of kyle schwarber , ' \" catcher david ross said .     and the way this narrative is playing out , cubs third baseman kris bryant predicts , it will soon be coming to a movie theater near you .     \" i can \u2019 t even describe what he \u2019 s doing right now , \" said left fielder ben zobrist , who \u2019 s hitting .625 this series and is like a back-drop to center stage . \" no one \u2019 s ever seen anything like it . \"     there has never been a position player in baseball history whose first hit of the season was in the world series until schwarber came along . he doubled off cleveland ace corey kluber in game 1 , and then went 2-for-4 with two rbi and a walk in wednesday \u2019 s victory .     \" he better not take one single swing in the offseason , \" first baseman anthony rizzo said .     indeed , the dude is making a total mockery out of spring training , let alone rehab assignments .     this is a guy who had no hits in four at-bats in april before he blew out his left knee . he had one hit in eight at-bats in the arizona fall league . now , on baseball \u2019 s greatest stage , he is hitting .429 , reaching base five times in nine at-bats , with a double , two singles and two rbi .     if he keeps this up , and schwarber leads the cubs to their first world series title since 1908 , there will be generations of schwarbers who will never have to pay for a drink or adult beverage in their lifetimes in the city of chicago .     \" if we win three more , \" rizzo said , \" he doesn \u2019 t have to take another swing in his life . take your time , and enjoy your life . \"     considering that schwarber has all of four months of baseball experience on his bubble-gum card , and is baseball \u2019 s ultimate gym rat , there \u2019 s a better chance of him conducting hitting lessons when he \u2019 s 80 than ever giving up this gig .     \" he \u2019 s just a dirt bag , \" rizzo said . \" he \u2019 s always around the field . he \u2019 s always watching baseball . always watching film . sometimes , too much .     \" when he was on the dl , he \u2019 s there watching film , studying scouting reports , and i would yell at him , ' what are you doing ? what are you doing?

they are going back to national league rules . there will be no dh at wrigley field . can he possibly play the field when he hasn \u2019 t played the outfield since tearing two knee ligaments on april 7 ?     \" he may be catching for all we know , \" rizzo said .     well , it \u2019 s safe to say he won \u2019 t be catching until next spring , but considering the way he \u2019 s running the bases every time he \u2019 s aboard , there \u2019 s a certain manager who will be pushing for the cause .     \" i ' m waiting to hear from our guys from our medical side , \" cubs manager joe maddon said , \" because obviously he looks good . he looks good at the plate . running the bases , he looks pretty good so far .     \" there ' s nothing about watching him that tells me that he ' s inhibited right now .     \" he \u2019 s a different cat , he absolutely is . \"     it \u2019 s one thing if there had been the scintilla of discussion that schwarber could possibly be ready for the playoffs , even privately among the cubs \u2019 front office . or even if schwarber had told a few teammates that this was his secret plan all along . but nothing . absolutely nothing .     sure , there were times during the season when schwarber would tease his teammates , saying he \u2019 d be back for that day-night doubleheader in august against the milwaukee brewers , and everyone would laugh . it was a running joke all season . the laughter stopped when rizzo was having dinner with strength coach tim buss before game 3 of the nlcs in los angeles .     \" i said , ' what? ' \" rizzo said . \" ' seriously ? for real? ' i couldn \u2019 t believe it . \"     the cubs still can \u2019 t .     \" i just took it day by day , \" schwarber said . \" there were days i just wasn \u2019 t feeling it . my teammates picked me up and i had some guys come over and say to me , ' world series , you \u2019 re coming back. \u2019 i \u2019 d just laugh it off .     \" then , when it came to reality , it was a shock . \"     imagine how the rest of us feel .     \" the legend of kyle schwarber , \" ross slowly said again .     stay tuned . the sequel is friday , the first world series night game in wrigley field history .     \" they are going to go nuts , \" ross said .     follow nightengale on twitter and facebook     gallery : cubs , indians clash in world series\n"}], "cassie": [{"url": "file://test/32/1/2", "title": "test/32/1/2", "content": "part of the exchange a woman received from a fitness trainer , who body-shamed her .

me. \u201d     yet , the cubs are the people least surprised by all this . they understand that schwarber possesses rare offensive gifts . they know how much he cares about the club . and they saw how hard he worked to return .     \u201cthis guy has been running in pools , doing rehab stuff the entire summer , hoping somehow he could contribute , \u201d hoyer said . \u201cwe let him rehab in chicago because he was such a big part of it , so great to be around .     \u201ca lot of guys we wouldn \u2019 t have allowed to stay here . but with him , he \u2019 s such a good teammate , he wants it so badly . if he had any possibility he was going to come back and help us , he was going to do it. \u201d     most players , ross said , would have \u201cchecked out \u201d after suffering such a major injury ; they would have gone home , done their rehab , played with their kids and prepared for the following season .     schwarber was different . schwarber always was part of the team .     \u201call of this was for these guys in the clubhouse and our organization , \u201d he said . \u201cit wasn \u2019 t for me. \u201d     the players could not help but notice .     \u201che stayed locked in when he was hurt , \u201d ross said . \u201cmentally , he \u2019 s been competing in his mind for a long time with us .     \u201cour new weight room has all mirrors . you look in there and he was in a full sweat by the time i get to the field . he \u2019 s got his day in before we start and he stays , does all his rehab , stays for the game , grinds out the game with us , cheering guys on , watching video , doing scouting reports . he \u2019 s a baseball rat. \u201d     call hollywood . hold wrigley . and if the doctors say ok , clear out left field .     lights ! schwarber ! action !\n"}]}, "user_id_to_descriptions": {"alice": "Is interested in compiling a summary.", "parker": "Knows about the following topics:\n", "eden": "Knows about the following topics:\nInternet Archive, web pages, broken links", "farshid": "Knows about the following topics:\nCubs, World Series, Kyle Schwarber, Cleveland Indians, Wrigley Field", "cassie": "Knows about the following topics:\nCassie Young, body-shaming, personal trainer, wedding, body acceptance\nMouse Mingle, Disney, dating site, Dave Tavres", "hannah": "Knows about the following topics:\nCassie Young, Facebook\nTwitter, location, privacy\nDisney, dating website, MouseMingle.com, Dave Tavres", "bhushan": "Knows about the following topics:\nbody shaming, personal trainer, wedding, body positivity, self worth", "dewei": "Knows about the following topics:\nKyle Schwarber, Chicago Cubs, World Series, baseball, comeback"}, "user_id_to_table_names": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_templated": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_lowprecision": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_lowprecision_templated": {}}
