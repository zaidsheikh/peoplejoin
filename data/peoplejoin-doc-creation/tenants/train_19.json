partners , and is soon to attend fordham law school in new york on a scholarship .     the princess , who like all female members of the imperial family who marry a \u201ccommoner \u201d would lose her royal status , was due to wed the 26-year-old paralegal in november this year , but in february their nuptials were abruptly postponed until 2020.         japan ' s princess mako postpones wedding until 2020 read more     the couple said they needed more time to prepare and to \u201cthink about marriage more deeply \u201d . there were also concerns that preparations for the wedding , the first in the imperial family since akihito \u2019 s only daughter married in a low-key ceremony in 2005 , could overshadow his abdication on 30 april next year .     the 84-year-old will be replaced on the chrysanthemum throne the following day by his eldest son , crown prince naruhito .     \u201cwe have come to realise the lack of time to make sufficient preparations for various events leading up to our marriage this autumn and our life afterward , \u201d mako said in a statement at the time . \u201cwe believe that we have rushed various things. \u201d     japanese media have reported , however , that mako \u2019 s parents , prince akishino and princess kiko , were increasingly troubled by media reports that komuro \u2019 s mother was experiencing financial problems stemming from a loan she received from her former partner to cover her son \u2019 s tuition .     mako \u2019 s parents reportedly told the komuros at several face-to-face meetings that the wedding could be marred by the mother \u2019 s reported debts and that the wedding could not go ahead until the matter had been resolved .     there are also concerns that the couple could invite public criticism , as they will receive a lump sum of about 100 million yen ( $ 900,000 ) from the government to help ease mako \u2019 s exit from the imperial family and into her new non-royal life .     komuro left for new york earlier this month to begin three years of study for the state \u2019 s bar exam . no date has been set for the wedding or the series of rituals that precede it , but kyodo news , citing a source close to the couple , said mako and komuro were in regular contact and still intended to marry .     \u2022 this article was amended on 9 august 2018 to correct a description of kei komuro as a lawyer , and to change a reference to kako that should have been mako . kako is a sister .\n"}], "dewei": [{"url": "file://train/19/0/3", "title": "train/19/0/3", "content": "thorsten heins , ceo of research in motion , introduces the blackberry 10 .

the couple , both 26 years old , announced their engagement after receiving the emperor ' s blessing . but the imperial household agency announced in february the postponement , citing a \" lack of

( credit : blackberry )     the z10 will be available from march in the us on at&t , verizon , sprint , and t-mobile , but price will vary by carrier . heins attributed the network testing phase as being the main reasons for the delay . it will be available in the uk tomorrow on all carriers -- including ee , o2 , vodafone , bt , and three -- with pricing set by carrier . the z10 will be available in canada on february 5.     the smartphone maker said the z10 will retail for \" around $ 149.99 on a three-year contract . \"     the q10 will be made available to worldwide carriers in april , and pricing will range between \u00a3 36 and \u00a3 45 per month for a two-year contract on most networks . in most cases , upfront fees should be expected .     today , blackberry chief executive thorsten heins said , \" finally , here we are . \" he noted that today was not the end point of more than two years ' work ; it was the \" starting line \" for a new wave of blackberry products .     and then heins dropped a surprise bomb on the audience by announcing that \" research in motion \" would become \" one consistent brand that is recognized around the world . \" rim will therefore become \" blackberry , \" combining the name of the company and the platform together .     \" one brand , one promise , \" heins said .     rim -- sorry , i mean blackberry -- has already garnered support from the three major carriers : verizon , at&t , and t-mobile . in total , blackberry has more than 650 carriers around the world .     blackberry global creative director alicia keys -- yes , the singer -- also shows that the company formerly known as rim is also targeting not just soccer moms , but also moms in the workplace , according to heins ' introduction .     she said , almost too honestly , that she left the blackberry platform but came back after balancing two phones between work and home . interestingly , blackberry has a solution to such a problem : blackberry balance , which targets bring-your-own-device ( byod ) users . the software allows users to separate work and home lives with blackberry balance , by splitting secure enterprise email and work apps with personal email accounts .     read this blackberry 10 launch : by the numbers blackberry , previously known as research in motion ( rim ) , launched the new blackberry 10 platform this morning . here are the numbers you need to know . read more     last week , blackberry released the back-end mobile device management service blackberry enterprise service ( bes ) 10 , which powers the new blackberry ' s secure message service , along with policy management of the devices , along with both ios and android phones .     the launch of the new platform and devices comes at a crucial time for the ontario , canada-based smartphone maker .     blackberry has been under pressure to release the next wave of blackberry smartphones -- its primary business focus -- in a bid to reclaim a considerable quarter-on-quarter loss in mobile market share .     blackberry 10 was also delayed by a whole fiscal quarter following poor first-quarter sales put the company ' s cash-flow situation in the spotlight . the company also cut 5,000 jobs as part of a major restructuring effort to refocus the company ' s efforts on the blackberry 10 platform .     blackberry -- which remains $ rimm on the nasdaq -- climbed by more than 4.6 percent in early morning trading , but dropped dramatically to more than 5 percent by the end of the launch event .\n"}, {"url": "file://train/19/1/1", "title": "train/19/1/1", "content": "okay , it \u2019 s been four months , no excuses \u2014 you should have finished \u201chouse of cards \u201d by now . if not , the clock \u2019 s ticking , because another online-only tv show set in washington is officially on the way .     \u201calpha house , \u201d a political satire about four republican senators who live together in a rowhouse on capitol hill , has been ordered to series by amazon studios , the company announced wednesday morning ; 13 episodes will air this year and early next year . the studio , a production arm of amazon.com , performed a nifty experiment about a month ago , posting more than a dozen television pilots \u2014 eight comedies and six children \u2019 s shows \u2014 to its consumer site . it called on customers to give feedback about which pilots they would like to see turned into full-fledged shows that would stream online .     apparently , viewers are fans of middle-aged men living like frat brothers and running the country in their spare time . \u201calpha house , \u201d created and written by \u201cdoonesbury \u201d cartoonist garry trudeau , was one of just two comedy pilots picked up for a full season .     but does the popularity of netflix \u2019 s \u201chouse of cards \u201d \u2014 which attempted to defy tv conventions in releasing all its episodes to its streaming site on the same day \u2014 hurt another washington series on the internet ? not at all , says executive producer jonathan alter . in fact , the kevin spacey drama was a huge benefit to the fledgling \u201calpha house. \u201d     \u201cit helped introduce people to the idea of watching online television , and especially online television about politics , \u201d said alter , a washington-based writer for bloomberg news who spent nearly three decades at newsweek .     the show , based on a real property in the district that has housed a rotation of various democratic senators for years , has been the brainchild of trudeau since about 2008. inspired by a new york times story about the house , trudeau originally wrote the pilot for network television , but things didn \u2019 t pan out .     last january , alter , a close friend of trudeau \u2019 s , brought up the idea of resurrecting the abandoned pilot . trudeau \u2019 s response , alter said , was something along the lines of , \u201cwell , be my guest. \u201d although trudeau was unsure about pitching the script to amazon studios , alter said , alter convinced him that an online series was the way to go .     having trudeau \u2019 s name attached to the project certainly helped it stand out , alter said , especially above the thousands of scripts amazon received when it announced an open call for ideas . but roy price , amazon studios director , insists that \u201conce you \u2019 re on the development slate , it \u2019 s all about the material. \u201d even though certain projects come into the studio in different ways , he said , \u201ci think we apply the same criteria to all the ideas that we look at. \u201d     either way , price added , studio execs were thrilled when they heard trudeau , a known political satirist , wanted to do a show about the district . \u201cwhen it comes to washington and its foibles and what makes it unique , few people have been more insightful and more knowledgeable than garry trudeau , \u201d price said .     alter agrees that trudeau \u2019 s voice was key to the show \u2019 s success , along with connections that helped land bill murray and stephen colbert in small roles in the pilot .     \u201ci do think it helped we got those cameos , \u201d alter said , then paused . \u201cand then it really helped when we got john goodman. \u201d     goodman plays gil john biggs , a brash , unfiltered senator from north carolina who seems to be the leader of the alpha house . when he \u2019 s not making fun of his roommate-colleagues , he \u2019 s on the phone with his wife , back in his home district , who \u2019 s telling him to step up his game , because the beloved duke basketball coach is planning to run against him in the next election . goodman is joined by clark johnson , matt malloy and mark consuelos , who also play republican senators .     ( trudeau went against the political affiliations of the actual house because , he said in a washington post interview , democrats are currently pretty boring , while republicans \u201care tearing themselves apart and will be for the foreseeable future. \u201d )     the pilot skewers various aspects of washington , cracking jokes at the expense of both conservatives and liberals . in one exciting coincidence , trudeau penned a scene about an epic filibuster years before the 13-hour speech in march by sen. rand paul ( r-ky. ) . at first , the writers of the show were worried that an all-night filibuster might seem unrealistic ; after paul \u2019 s performance , truth proved stranger than fiction , and the scene stayed .     once the crew learned that filming on the capitol grounds would be next to impossible , they wound up shooting most of the pilot in new york , with exterior shots of the district , including a rowhouse on maryland avenue that will stand in for the alpha house . while taking creative license for the comedy , alter said , they try to keep everything as realistic as possible for eagle-eyed viewers . this means the little details : the bowl of tiny american flag pins the senators keep on hand , low-level staff members sitting against the walls \u2014 instead of at the table \u2014 in meetings . ( it doesn \u2019 t stop there : alter said they \u2019 ll be making adjustments in the future on set after he noticed on c-span that the real senate floor chairs differed slightly from theirs. )     in the original article that inspired \u201calpha house , \u201d housemate sen. richard j. durbin ( d-ill. ) was quoted , saying that , in theory , everyone wanted to do a tv show about the unusual living situation , but \u201cthen they realize that the story of four middle-aged men , with no sex and violence , is not going to last two weeks. \u201d     hearing that quote , alter laughed . \u201cwe \u2019 ve addressed the question of sex , \u201d he said , referring to a scene in the pilot in which the newest senator , played by consuelos , is shown enthusiastically keeping busy during the all-night filibuster at the capitol .     \u201cand , \u201d alter added , in case any viewers need more enticement about another political show , \u201cthere may actually be some violence that \u2019 s coming , too. \u201d\n"}]}, "user_id_to_descriptions": {"alice": "Is interested in compiling a summary.", "eden": "Knows about the following topics:\nAlicia Keys, Blackberry, celebrity, creative director, technology\nPrincess Mako, Kei Komuro, marriage, financial scandal, royal status", "dewei": "Knows about the following topics:\nBlackberry, Z10, Q10, smartphone, touchscreen\nPrincess Mako, Kei Komuro, engagement, financial dispute, Japan", "cassie": "Knows about the following topics:\nBlackberry 10, Z10, Q10, RIM, Thorsten Heins", "parker": "Knows about the following topics:\nBlackberry, Blackberry 10, Blackberry Z10, Blackberry Q10, Thorsten Heins\nAlpha House, Amazon Studios, Garry Trudeau, John Goodman, political satire"}, "user_id_to_table_names": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_templated": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_lowprecision": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_lowprecision_templated": {}}
