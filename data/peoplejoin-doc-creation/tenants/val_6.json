     forsyth county sheriff duane piper said the shooter , dennis marx , walked into forsyth county administration building on east main street at about 10 : 30 a.m. and opened fire . he was armed with an assault rifle , according to authorities . piper said marx threw stop sticks on the road so that cars could not approach .         marx was approached by deputy daniel rush who he then shot in the leg , piper confirmed .     \u201cthe only way i can describe it is in a frontal assault on our court house , \u201d piper said .     piper said rush was taken to north fulton hospital in roswell with non-life threatening injuries .     \u201cfrom the video , it looks like he saw that deputy , swerved to try and run over the deputy . the deputy engaged him . he was shooting at mr. marx in the vehicle , mr. marx was shooting through the windshield at the deputy , \u201d piper said .         the swat team , which was on its way to a separate incident , arrived at the courthouse within 37 seconds . marx was shot dead in front of the court house a short time later .     none of the other deputies involved in the incident were injured .         piper described marx \u2019 s home as a \u201cbomb. \u201d when officers entered the home friday night , they found pipe bombs and other incendiary devices but none were booby-trapped to go off .         the sheriff said evidence showed that marx had not been living at his home for more than a week and instead had been staying at a hotel . piper said it will take hours to clear the courthouse .     \u201cit ' s kind of creepy to find out a whacko lives in your neighborhood , \u201d jane bizzell said . she along with others was not allowed into the neighborhood . neighbor dorothy varano who lived up the street from marx said police visited her home a number of times throughout the day and told her to stay indoors for her safety .     but learning the house was filled with explosives made browning wonder about her now deceased neighbor .     \u201ci know a lot of people build up a lot of hatred , but i think he built up a double dose to do what he did , \u201d said margaret browning .     the gunman ' s attorney told channel 2 she was representing him until thursday , when she withdrew because he was unsatisfied with her negotiating skills . he was due in court on friday for marijuana and firearms charges . the attorney said the man was a gun buyer and trader .     \u201chis emotional state was very fragile . he was very sensitive , very , very , scared . he has no prior criminal history . he was obsessed with not going to jail , \u201d said marx \u2019 s former attorney ann shafer .     the area is still closed as police investigate and drivers are asked to avoid the area of downtown cumming until further notice .     rush posted on his facebook page that he was \u201cok. \u201d     one construction worker was just feet away when the shooting happened . gary womack described the situation as

nearly three-minute long gunfight friday ended with marx dead , after being confronted by a swarm of law enforcement officers .     they seemingly came from everywhere -- from the jail across the street , as part of a swat team that happened to be nearby and even inside the courthouse where they busted out windows in order to get more angles to target the attacked .     dennis marx was shot

confronted marx , who then tried to run the deputy over -- for his vital part in deterring the attacker . shot twice in the leg , the deputy was the only person wounded despite what the sheriff called \" a full frontal assault . \"     \" it was very close to being a major catastrophe , \" piper said . \" the deputy that was shot ... averted what , i think , would have been a lot more deaths . \"     swift , significant response to attack     marx was supposed to be at the forsyth county courthouse in cumming . court documents show he faced 11 felony charges -- 10 of them related to the manufacture , possession and sale of illicit drugs , including marijuana , plus one count of having a firearm while in the commission of a felony -- dating back to august 2011.     according to the sheriff ' s office , he was expected to enter a plea friday before chief superior court judge jeffrey bagley .     needless to say , he never made it .     instead , around 10 a.m. friday , marx drove up to the courthouse , threw out \" homemade spike strips \" to delay any police response , and tried to run over the deputy , piper said .     the deputy -- a 30-year veteran whose duties include canvassing the scene outside the courthouse -- opened fire , and marx returned fire through his windshield .     he didn ' t stop with bullets . according to the sheriff , marx tossed tear gas grenades , smoke grenades and pepper spray grenades -- something he could do more easily with his gas mask strapped on .     despite this barrage of weapons , the sheriff ' s deputy was able to distract marx , to slow him . even a little delay made a big difference , as officers armed with assault rifles came over from the jail across the street .     just watched suspect in custody in

fire at one point , authorities don ' t yet know which one of them fired the fatal shot .     ' he was there to occupy the courthouse '     afterward , the wounded deputy -- identified by local media as james daniel rush -- was transported to a local hospital .     there , the officer had surgery for fractures to his fibula and tibia in the lower right leg , injuries piper said weren ' t life-threatening .     but his colleagues still had to work to do . they went to marx ' s home in cumming , a small city about 35 northeast of downtown atlanta , with every expectation that it was booby trapped .     as piper said : \" last time we were at the home , we were suspicious because it had been booby trapped before . \"     once they finally made their way in and cleared the house , they found homemade explosives , according to a law enforcement source . it wasn ' t clear whether those were attempted booby traps .     a preliminary investigation found that marx hadn ' t been in his cumming home for about 10 days . besides that , little is known about him beyond that he began working at the transportation security administration in october 2002 , according to a u.s. official , and left either the next year or in 2004.     the sheriff said friday that he and others weren ' t ready yet to discuss marx ' s motive or his thinking .     that said , piper said it was evident that marx \" came prepared to stay a while . \"     \" we don ' t know who he was coming to the courthouse for , but with the flex ties and the restraining devices he had with him , \" said the sheriff . \" we have to assume that he was there to occupy the courthouse . \"     who is the student who pounded on the seattle gunman ?     canada shooting : suspect yelled ' i ' m done ' at time of arrest     navy seals off virginia military hospital in hunt for stabbing suspect\n"}, {"url": "file://val/6/2/2", "title": "val/6/2/2", "content": "2-year-old brody allen , diagnosed with a rare brain cancer , is celebrating christmas early as his family tries to make their remaining time with him happy ( photo : provided by the allen family )     colerain police arrested two teens wednesday night , who they say confessed to slashing christmas decorations on adair court .     the decorations are up for brody allen , a 2-year-old suffering from a rare brain cancer . the community is giving the toddler an early christmas .     more : christmas comes early to colerain twp . tot suffering with brain cancer     chief mark denney said the teens were caught after someone saw them slashing a decoration on niagara at 11 p.m.     brody allen ' s house is all decked out for christmas .

study indicates that those in consensual open relationships are just as satisfied .     the study , led by um associate professor of psychology and women ' s studies terri conley , showed that heterosexuals in consensual open relationships reported high levels of satisfaction and trust , as well as low levels of jealousy .         \" overall , the outcomes for monogamous and consensual nonmonogamous participants were the same - indicating no net benefit of one relationship style over another , \" said conley , in a news release .         conley and colleagues conducted analyses of different relationships among participants older than age 25. the sample included 2,124 people - including 1,507 individuals in monogamous relationships and 617 individuals in committed non-monogamous relationships .     the group rated relationship components : satisfaction , commitment , trust , jealousy and passionate love , which is the intense love feeling often described in new relationships .         researchers found no differences between monogamous and consensual nonmonogamous participants in terms of satisfaction and passionate love .     furthermore , levels of jealousy were lower and trust was higher among those engaged in committed non-monogamous relationships .     another finding differed from people ' s assumptions that those in non-monogamous relationships do not care about each other enough to be happy in their primary relationship . the study , however , showed that an individual had more satisfaction , trust , commitment and passionate love in their primary mate than in their secondary relationship .     the study did show that people in open relationships generally reported somewhat poorer relational functioning than monogamous individuals . individuals in open relationships were significantly less satisfied and less committed to their relationship than their monogamous counterparts .     they also reported lower levels of passionate love and fewer jealous cognitions than monogamous people and also scored marginally lower on the index of behavioral jealousy than monogamous individuals .     the findings appear in the current issue of perspectives on psychological science .\n"}, {"url": "file://val/6/0/2", "title": "val/6/0/2", "content": "sex is a big part of most romances , whether a marriage or a more experimental union . a recent survey of europeans shows that people in the most sexually liberated partnerships aren \u2019 t having the best time . monogamous couples reported that they were the most sexually satisfied of all the groups in a large , representative survey conducted in march 2017.     among the 1,885 people who said they were in monogamous relationships , 82 % reported that they were broadly satisfied with their sex life . that compared to 80 % of people in a marriage , civil union or other legal partnership , while 71 % of people in open or polyamorous relationships said they were fulfilled .     the survey , conducted by dalia , a berlin-based research company , included over 11,000 people from the 28 countries in the european union aged 14-65 , though for the purposes of reporting they then excluded those aged under 18.     the findings echo us research that showed that people with young kids had the most sex of all americans . people who live together ( as couples with children often do ) have readier access to sex than those in relationships who don \u2019 t live together . the eu survey only found 275 people , or 2.5 % of the total , who said they were in open relationships .     age and gender also affect sex-life satisfaction . men overall reported a slight increase in satisfaction as age increased , while women \u2019 s satisfaction remained stable . for both genders , the highest peak was between the ages of 25 and 30. and though not every country in the eu provided enough respondents to produce a statistically significant finding , some that did showed marked differences . spain proved to be the most sexually satisfied country with 41 % of people saying they were \u201cvery satisfied \u201d with their sex lives , while in germany that number was 38 % . in poland only 23 % said they were \u201d very satisfied , \u201d compared to 28 % in italy and 29 % in both the uk and france .     opening up a relationship can be about more than sex . advocates talk
