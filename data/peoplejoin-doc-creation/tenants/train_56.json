"washington \u2014 the federal government is on track to forgive at least $ 108 billion in student debt in coming years , as more and more borrowers seek help in paying down their loans , leading to lower revenues for the nation \u2019 s program to finance higher education .     the government accountability office disclosed the sum wednesday in a report to congress which for the first time projected the full costs of programs that set borrowers \u2019 monthly payments as a share of their earnings and eventually forgive portions of their debt .     the gao report also sharply criticized the government \u2019 s accounting methods for its $ 1.26 trillion student-loan portfolio , pointing to flaws that have led it to alter projected revenues significantly over the years . the government says it still expects the program to generate a profit over the long term , but it has repeatedly trimmed expectations for revenues .     president barack obama has promoted income-driven repayment plans \u2014 passed by congress in the 1990s and 2000s \u2014 to stem a sharp rise in borrowers defaulting on their loans since the recession . enrollment in such plans has more than tripled over the past three years to 5.3 million borrowers , who owe roughly $ 269 billion , according to education department statistics cited by the gao .     a new federal report shows that the government is expected to forgive at least $ 108 billion in student debt in the coming years . the relief is part of an obama administration plan to help borrowers , but is proving costly . wsj ' s lee hawkins explains .     ted mitchell , undersecretary at the education department , said such programs \u201care helping millions of borrowers successfully manage loan repayment , particularly those for whom standard repayment may prove challenging. \u201d     he added that the administration has proposed changes to reduce costs . mr. obama , for example , has called for capping how much debt public-service workers can have forgiven .     the most generous version of income-driven repayments caps a borrower \u2019 s monthly payment at 10 % of discretionary income , which is defined as adjusted gross income above 150 % of the poverty level .     that formula typically lowers monthly payments of borrowers by hundreds of dollars . public-service workers \u2014 those employed by a government agency or at most nonprofits \u2014 have balances forgiven after 10 years , tax-free . private-sector workers have balances forgiven in 20 or 25 years , with the forgiven amount taxed as ordinary income .     president-elect donald trump said during his campaign he supported the idea of helping student-loan borrowers . he has proposed setting payments at 12.5 % of income and forgiving balances after 15 years . he has also suggested winding down the federal student loan program and shifting lending to the private sector .     growing evidence suggests many of the most hard-pressed borrowers \u2014 college dropouts who owe less than $ 10,000 \u2014 aren \u2019 t taking advantage of the programs , while workers with graduate degrees , such as doctors and lawyers who don \u2019 t necessarily need help , are .     the figures that the gao cites suggest the average balance of borrowers in income-driven repayment plans stands at roughly $ 51,000 . that sum suggests a disproportionate share of those benefiting from the plans are graduate-degree holders . undergraduate borrowers owe about $ 30,000 , on average , upon graduation , other research shows , and the government caps lifetime borrowing from federal programs for undergraduates at $ 57,500 . it doesn \u2019 t limit how much grad students can borrow . and graduate-degree holders typically have higher incomes and have low rates of unemployment , labor department data show .     there are still about 8 million americans in default on their student loans , and the number of defaults among borrowers who recently left school has come down only slowly .     meanwhile , senate budget committee chairman mike enzi ( r. , wyo . ) , who ordered the gao study , has criticized the obama administration \u2019 s use of executive authority to sweeten terms of the repayment plans , which he said would add to the national debt .     \u201cthis administration has been manipulating the terms of the student loan program without the consent of congress , while shirking its statutory duty to carefully assess the cost impact of those changes , \u201d mr. enzi said in a statement , adding that he was considering legislation to force changes in the government \u2019 s accounting methods .     some outside academics say it is increasingly likely that the projected surpluses of the federal student loan portfolio \u2014 which has more than doubled over the past decade \u2014 won \u2019 t materialize . \u201ci \u2019 m not at all confident that the federal government will end up making money on student loans , \u201d said robert kelchen , an assistant professor of higher education at seton hall university .     in addition to debt forgiveness under income-driven repayment programs , the administration is also moving to forgive loans for borrowers who can show they were lured to enroll at schools \u2014 mostly for-profit colleges \u2014 that used deceptive advertising .     students at the rutgers university graduation ceremonies in piscataway , n.j. , in may . photo : mel evans/associated press     income-driven repayment plans are also causing concern that as more students become aware of the benefits , they will become less sensitive to tuition increases , enabling universities continually to raise tuition ultimately at taxpayer expense . higher education costs have increased by an average of 5.2 % a year in the past decade , far faster than inflation , which has been running at under 2 % .     and some borrowers with graduate-school loans are refinancing their debt at lower interest rates with private lenders such as sofi . congress , through legislation , has set higher interest rates for grad students than undergrads , to ensure the programs don \u2019 t lose money . when private lenders pick off those borrowers , the surpluses dwindle .     the gao estimates $ 137 billion owed under income-driven repayments won \u2019 t be repaid . most of it \u2014 the $ 108 billion disclosed wednesday \u2014 would be forgiven because of borrowers fulfilling their obligations under the plans . the other $ 29 billion will be written off because of disability or death , the gao projects , the only other circumstances under which the government takes a loan off its books . the government can garnish wages and social security checks for those in default .     and that $ 108 billion only covers loans made through the current fiscal year . the overall sum could continue to grow alongside enrollment increases . the gao said it could take 40 years to know the full costs of the programs .     still , supporters say the plans offer a lifeline to borrowers who are unemployed or earning little , while the obama administration has credited the programs with leading to a reduction in the number of new graduates defaulting on their loans .     supporters point out that under current law , any amount forgiven would be taxed as ordinary income for private-sector workers , limiting the benefits for individuals . public-sector workers aren \u2019 t taxed on forgiveness .     the gao report also criticizes how the education department has produced budget estimates for the loan program . for example , it said the department has failed to account for inflation when estimating borrowers \u2019 future earnings . and it said the agency failed to account for further increases in enrollment in income-driven repayment plans .     write to josh mitchell at joshua.mitchell@wsj.com     corrections &amp; amplifications :     borrowers enrolled in plans that forgive student debt owe an average of about $ 51,000 and a combined $ 269 billion , according to education department statistics cited by the government accountability office . an earlier

( oliver contreras for the washington post )     the price tag on a popular student loan repayment program is far larger than education department estimates , the government accountability office said wednesday . the gao pegged the true cost at about $ 108 billion and called the education department \u2019 s accounting unreliable .     [ what you need to know about obama \u2019 s latest student loan plan before enrolling ]     to help people manage their student loans , the obama administration has expanded programs that cap monthly payments to a percentage of earnings and eventually forgives the balance . enrollment in these income-driven repayment plans is soaring and so is the cost , but the government \u2019 s budget estimates are not keeping pace , an oversight that fuels criticism of a federal policy that conservatives say has become far too expensive .     current budget estimates for income-driven plans are more than double what was originally expected for loans made in fiscal 2009 through 2016 , climbing from $ 25 billion to $ 53 billion , according to the gao report . the growth is primarily a result of the rising volume of loans in the plans , but researchers at the gao say faulty projections from education officials may cause costs to be over- or understated by billions of dollars .     [ lowering student debt payments is costing taxpayers billions of dollars ]     \u201csome uncertainty is unavoidable when anticipating long-term loan costs , \u201d the gao wrote , \u201cbut we found numerous shortcomings in education \u2019 s estimation approach and quality control practices that call into question the reliability of its budget estimates and affect the quality of information congress has to make informed budget decisions. \u201d     the report takes issue with education officials \u2019 assumption that borrowers \u2019 incomes will not grow with inflation , which could lower estimated costs by more than $ 17 billion . the model also fails to account for people switching in or out of the plans in the future , which frequently happens when they have to certify their income to remain in the program each year .     in a letter to the gao , amy mcintosh , a deputy assistant secretary in the education department , said the agency has been working with treasury to revise its estimates and agreed that there is room for improvement . the department in its annual budget report said the money being repaid through other student loan programs offsets some of the expense of the income-driven plans .     \u201cthe life cycle of a student loan is exceedingly complex , with a multitude of projection paths and outcomes , \u201d mcintosh wrote . \u201cwe are constantly seeking to enhance and refine our cost estimation models. \u201d     still , she noted that the decisions made , and critiqued in the report , were \u201cbased on existing staff and system resources available , assessed impact and consideration for conservatism. \u201d the observation calls into question whether the government agency is capable of managing a multibillion-dollar program that is projected to grow .     \u201creading between the lines of the gao report makes it sound like the department of education \u2026 has got one or two staff with a 30-year-old computer or maybe index cards trying to figure out costs , \u201d said jason delisle , a resident fellow at the american enterprise institute , a conservative think tank . \u201cyou need to hire a firm that is skilled at estimating the value of financial securities to tell you what these loans are worth and what they \u2019 ll cost taxpayers. \u201d     as it stands , there are 5.3 million people enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan with about $ 353 billion in outstanding student loans . although the government has let people repay education debt based on their income for the past 20 years , few took advantage until the obama administration expanded the number of options and eligibility . plans are designed to prevent borrowers from defaulting on their loans and ruining their credit .     \u201cthis is a way that we can ensure that graduates are fulfilling their basic responsibility to repay the government for the money that they borrowed , \u201d white house press secretary josh earnest told reporters wednesday . \u201cbut we want to make sure that when students graduate , that they \u2019 re not saddled with so much debt that they \u2019 re essentially penalized financially for pursuing college education opportunities. \u201d     the gao estimates that $ 215 billion , or 61 percent of the debt in income-driven plans , will be paid in full . another $ 108 billion will be forgiven , with the remaining $ 29 billion discharged because of death or disability . but those estimates are only for loans made from 1995 to 2017. as more people sign up , the cost of the program will soar .     \u201cat a time when our nation is facing a mammoth national debt , the department of education has expanded a student loan program that will cost twice as much as originally estimated , \u201d senate budget committee chairman mike enzi ( r-wyo . ) , who requested the gao study , said in a statement . \u201cthis administration has been manipulating the terms of the student loan program without the consent of congress , while shirking its statutory duty to carefully assess the cost impact of those changes. \u201d     enzi said at the very least there needs to be greater transparency in the way education officials calculate costs , but his office said he is not calling for any major changes to the repayment plans at the moment .     congressional republicans have called president obama \u2019 s expansion of the repayment program fiscally irresponsible and pushed for dialing back eligibility . even obama has proposed limiting forgiveness for graduate students . yet president-elect donald trump has said he would lower the period of repayment , a move that will probably raise the cost for taxpayers .

from the moment they moved into the five-bedroom , 4,900-square-foot manse along the potomac river in fort washington .     in five years , they have never made a mortgage payment , a fact that amazes even the most seasoned veterans of the foreclosure crisis .     the ritters have kept the sheriff at bay by repeatedly filing for bankruptcy and by exploiting changes in maryland \u2019 s laws designed to help delinquent homeowners avoid foreclosure .     those efforts to protect homeowners have transformed maryland \u2019 s foreclosure process from one of the country \u2019 s shortest to one of the longest . it now takes on average 634 days to complete a foreclosure in maryland , compared with 132 days in virginia .     champions of maryland \u2019 s system , including gov . martin o \u2019 malley ( d ) , credit it with driving down the state \u2019 s foreclosure rate and helping thousands of victims of predatory lending , fraud and other abuses hang on to their homes .     \u201cthe market won \u2019 t fix itself , \u201d said anne norton , maryland \u2019 s deputy commissioner for financial regulations . \u201cby the time it does , how many homeowners will be churned up and spit out by the machine ? \u201d     critics , including economists and lenders , blame the state \u2019 s go-slow approach for a growing backlog of foreclosures and a weak-to-nonexistent recovery in home prices . to them , the system puts too much emphasis on helping individual homeowners and not enough on quickly clearing the market of foreclosures so prices can rebound and hard-hit communities can recover . and they say it also creates opportunities for abuse by those determined to drag the process out for as long as possible .     \u201chow is it people can stay in a house for five years without ever making a mortgage payment ? \u201d said thomas a. lawler , a former senior vice president at fannie mae who now runs his own consulting firm in loudoun county . \u201cthat \u2019 s a screwed-up process . it \u2019 s an example of how the process is broken. \u201d     the ritters , who bought their house for $ 1.29 million with almost no money down , are hardly representative of the vast majority of maryland \u2019 s distressed homeowners .     during the boom , they set out to become mini real estate moguls , buying properties and flipping them for a profit . in the process , keith ritter , 54 , went from being on probation for bankruptcy fraud and making minimum wage to being a successful real estate investor and landlord with a six-figure income . then , when the housing market tanked five years ago , the couple found themselves facing multiple foreclosures .     the ritters have tried to negotiate different payment arrangements with their lender to save their posh home near national harbor , they said , but to no avail .     \u201cit was never our intention to get here and never make a mortgage payment , \u201d keith ritter said . \u201cwe don \u2019 t believe in living for free. \u201d     but he and janet , a 51-year-old real estate agent , make no apology for using every tactic available to them to stay in their house , including challenging the foreclosure sale in court , requesting mediation and claiming they had a tenant living with them . their adversaries , they argued , are giant financial institutions with armies of lawyers that are out to make as much money as possible at the expense of homeowners .     \u201cwhen a bank does all it can to save itself , that \u2019 s good business , \u201d keith said . \u201cwhen a homeowner does the same thing , he \u2019 s called a deadbeat. \u201d     reprieve after reprieve     for a guy who has lost much of his wealth and is on the verge of getting booted from his home , keith ritter is oddly calm . he says things such as , \u201cno matter what happens , we are at peace \u201d and likes to quote scripture .     he and janet pray daily , read the bible , attend pentecostal services and are reliable tithers . their faith fuels their hope that they can somehow stave off eviction . but they also keep the sheriff \u2019 s office on speed dial . keith calls the number every few days , always with the same question : \u201cdo you have a date for us yet ? \u201d     by now , he recognizes the voices that answer the phone at the sheriff \u2019 s office . they keep the conversation brief .     no , nothing yet . another reprieve .     ritter \u2019 s composure in the face of eviction may be due to the fact that he has survived worse . a native of detroit , he settled in the washington area after college and started a successful company cleaning commercial buildings . through his business , he got interested in real estate .     \u201ci saw real estate as the way to wealth , \u201d ritter said .     by the 1990s , he was buying up properties in northern virginia , and he quickly learned that making money in real estate can be harder than it looks .     \u201ci made a lot of mistakes , \u201d he said .     according to federal prosecutors and court records , ritter bought real estate and then put the properties in the names of family members . when he fell behind on mortgage payments , he filed for bankruptcy protection in his relatives \u2019 names in various jurisdictions to stop foreclosure proceedings . then he tried to get the bankruptcy filings dismissed without telling the mortgage lenders . he pleaded guilty in 2000 to bankruptcy fraud and was sentenced to 15 months in federal prison in petersburg , va. , where he wrote the first of three books about his deepening faith , \u201clife from the inside. \u201d     \u201ci \u2019 ve always loved god , \u201d ritter said . \u201ci haven \u2019 t always obeyed god , but i \u2019 ve always loved him. \u201d     when he got out of prison , he spent two years on probation , working at a sears to pay $ 10,000 in court-ordered restitution .     by the time his probation ended in 2004 , the housing boom was underway . he and janet settled in fort washington , an affluent , fast-growing community south of the beltway .     the ritters started out in a $ 360,000 , 2,300-square-foot house with a circular driveway and a pool . as its value skyrocketed , the couple borrowed against it to buy other properties in fort washington that they would fix up and then sell . they were convinced that national harbor , a massive planned hotel , retail and convention center complex , would raise home values .     at one point , they owned seven properties . in 2004 , the run-up in prices was so steep that the ritters grossed more than $ 200,000 in six months , off two deals . in 2006 , they made close to that amount with a single sale .     the couple , who have no children , began driving mercedes-benz sedans and taking trips to europe and the middle east . they also donated $ 6,000 to a church in springfield , court records show .     ritter said he began to worry in 2006 , when a few deals started falling through because the buyers could not get financing . he started looking into buying a restaurant , where he could showcase his wife \u2019 s cooking . then a real estate agent friend came by , saying , \u201ci \u2019 ve got a house for you. \u201d     the custom-built property , on three-quarters of an acre on riverview road , was a showstopper , with palladian windows , high ceilings and a gabled roof . inside , french patio doors led to a magnificent sunroom . the dining room had red walls , a tray ceiling and a chandelier the original owner had brought back from prague . upstairs , the master bedroom had a sitting area and a three-way fireplace . the windows surrounding the tub in the master bath offered incredible views of the potomac . and the house next door had sold for $ 1.7 million .     the ritters were not sure they could afford the million-dollar-plus price tag until they were approved by realty mortgage corp. , a now-defunct mississippi lender , for $ 1 million . another lender covered the down payment .     the couple called their new residence \u201cgod \u2019 s house \u201d because , as keith ritter put it , \u201cthat \u2019 s the only way we could have been approved for a loan. \u201d     they did not get to revel in their good fortune for long . by the time they moved in at the end of 2006 , home prices had begun their disastrous free fall .     the housing crash     the market soured with ferocious speed . between 2006 and 2008 , housing prices in prince george \u2019 s county fell 17 percent while the number of properties in foreclosure surged from 3,094 to 32,338 , according to a state report . housing counselors went from seeing one homeowner behind on a mortgage a week to seeing 10 a day .     for the ritters , the housing crash was a catastrophe . the couple still owned five properties , four of which they had rented out .     but falling home values meant they could not refinance the mortgages , some of which carried adjustable rates . pretty soon the rents they were charging were not covering the mortgages . janet ritter \u2019 s sales commissions started to dry up , along with other sources of income . by the time the first mortgage payment of almost $ 7,600 on the riverview road house was due in january 2007 , they faced a decision : which properties to save .     \u201cdo we put the money we had left in this one ? or is it better to spread it to the others ? \u201d keith ritter recalled wondering .     they chose the latter course , expecting to be able to catch up on the riverview road payments later . but that didn \u2019 t happen .     the first foreclosure against the riverview road house was filed in 2007. by that time , realty mortgage no longer owned their loan , which would change hands at least two more times . the foreclosure case was brought by lawyers representing mortgage electronic registration systems , or mers , the controversial electronic mortgage registry that some lenders used as a proxy to initiate foreclosures . but the proceedings ground to a halt the next year after janet ritter filed for bankruptcy protection . the bankruptcy case was later dismissed at her request .     meanwhile , the couple \u2019 s rental properties and previous residence , which they had held on to , were also facing foreclosure .     in 2009 , the year foreclosure proceedings began on their old house on clay drive , keith ritter filed for bankruptcy twice . both bankruptcy cases were later dismissed , but they managed to disrupt the foreclosure of the clay drive home three separate times . the property was even sold on the courthouse steps in upper marlboro in spring 2010. however , a county circuit court judge later declared the sale invalid because the bankruptcy case was still active when the sale took place .     ritter defended his tactics .     \u201canytime anyone tries to take your home , \u201d he said , \u201cyou are going to use the legal system to save it. \u201d     only they didn \u2019 t save it . in 2010 , the riverview road house went into foreclosure for the second time shortly after kondaur capital , a california company that buys and services troubled home loans , purchased the note from morgan stanley .     talks with kondaur began . the ritters initially agreed to a short sale , with a starting sales price of $ 1 million that was later dropped to $ 799,000 . the house did not get any takers .     at different times , the couple said , they offered to make payments , but they said kondaur turned them down , preferring to foreclose . kondaur did not return calls and e-mails asking for comment . the company \u2019 s attorney , robert hillman , also declined to discuss the case .     the ritters then asked for a remedy that had just been approved by maryland lawmakers to help distressed homeowners : mediation .     \u201cdefendant( s ) , humbly prays that the honorable judge , will recognize that this process , written into law by governor o \u2019 malley was to prevent just this situation , whereby the note holder can . . . trample on the rights of the homeowner , \u201d keith ritter wrote in a december 2010 mediation request .     when the mediation day arrived in april , however , the ritters were not there . they later said that , because of a mailing address mix-up , they never got the necessary paperwork . they complained that they were denied mediation , but prince george \u2019 s circuit court judge thomas p. smith ordered the house sold .     janet ritter filed for bankruptcy , this time in georgia , where the couple owned another house that was later lost to foreclosure . the foreclosure on the riverview road house was stopped again until that bankruptcy was dismissed , too . the house finally went on the auction block in july , and kondaur bought it back for $ 552,500 , a common industry practice .     the ritters immediately challenged the sale in court . judge smith ratified the sale . the couple then said they had a tenant living with them , potentially triggering recently passed state and federal laws that prohibit tenants from being tossed out when their landlords are foreclosed on . kondaur \u2019 s attorneys again demanded possession of the house , usually the last step before eviction . a hearing was set for mid-december .     the day of the hearing , the hallway outside the courtroom buzzed with speculation that the couple in the million-dollar home had finally reached the end of the road .     hillman , the kondaur attorney , arrived first . as he placed his briefcase on the plaintiff \u2019 s table , he said to the few people seated inside the courtroom , \u201cit \u2019 s old me \u2014 the underdog. \u201d     the ritters arrived soon after to represent themselves . the tenant , whom the judge had ordered to appear , was a no-show .     janet ritter argued that kondaur had no right to foreclose , because it could not prove it owned the note on the house . she said some of the paperwork documenting the mortgage \u2019 s many transfers from one pool of mortgages to another was fraudulent because it had been \u201crobosigned , \u201d a legacy of hasty processing during the boom in which foreclosure-mill employees signed thousands of documents without reading them . such errors have been sufficient to halt foreclosures in other states . and widespread evidence of robosigning led to a recent $ 25 billion settlement with several major banks on behalf of hundreds of thousands of homeowners . but in maryland , the courts have ruled that if the lender can provide records of a note \u2019 s history , and how it came to possess it , it has the right to foreclose , even if the records weren \u2019 t properly endorsed .     in response to janet ritter \u2019 s argument , hillman held up an original copy of the note , with keith ritter \u2019 s signature in blue ink .     judge smith awarded kondaur possession of the property . two days later , kondaur filed for eviction . the ritters knew it was only a matter of time before the sheriff showed up at their door to deliver it .     a long-shot hope     on a rainy wednesday in february , keith ritter stood in front of a foreclosed brick house a few miles from his home on riverview road . on the garage door , the county had posted a notice that said the property needed to be cleaned .     ritter , dressed in jeans , a knit cap and a jacket , had come to clear the house as part of his new business , beat it movers , which cleans and maintains foreclosed homes so they can be sold . ritter gets the irony of working for some of the same banks that have foreclosed on him . but he has to make money somehow .     \u201call i know is real estate , \u201d he said .     the job took only 30 minutes . afterward , ritter decided to stop at another house nearby that he and janet bought in 2006. it was also in foreclosure , although it had not been auctioned yet .     the tenant had moved out about two months earlier , and the house was empty except for a leather sectional just off the kitchen . the beeping sound of smoke detectors with dead batteries pierced the air at regular intervals . ritter and the other men went inside to bring out the couch .     being able to clear out your own house is a luxury , and far better than the alternative . ritter dreads coming home to riverview road to find his belongings \u2014 the fine furniture and framed artwork , his wife \u2019 s designer shoes \u2014 spread out on the front lawn .     \u201cpeople think , because you haven \u2019 t paid , you must be a bad person . but not everything is black and white , \u201d ritter said . \u201ca lot of things happen between the lines. \u201d     ritter still thinks he can work something out to save his house . he is trying to persuade an investor to buy the house from kondaur and then sell it back to them . it \u2019 s a long shot , and ritter said he has been praying a lot . in january , he fasted for 30 days \u201cfor spiritual cleansing and guidance , \u201d he said .     he has found solace in his bible , especially a passage from matthew that he has bracketed in black ink from the parable of the unforgiving servant .     \u201cat this the servant fell on his knees before him , \u201d the passage reads . \u201c \u2018be patient with me , \u2019 he begged , \u2018and i will pay back everything. \u2019 \u201d     staff researchers jennifer jenkins and magda jean-louis contributed to

education department drastically underestimated the cost of the government ' s income-driven repayment plans for student loans in its original estimates , the government accountability office said in a highly critical report wednesday .     the gao report finds that estimates of the cost to the government of income-driven repayment plans -- which eventually discharge a student ' s remaining debt after 20 years or more of payments -- has jumped from $ 28 billion to $ 53 billion for student loans issued from 2009 to 2016. and it found that nearly a third of student loan debt expected to be repaid via income-driven repayments ( $ 108 billion ) will be forgiven by the federal government through programs such as public service loan forgiveness .     observers of federal financial aid policy said those numbers -- and the apparent inability of the department to estimate the cost of student loan programs -- could provide new ammunition to republican lawmakers looking to target expensive student aid programs to rein in costs , if not drastically downsize the department itself . the gao investigated the costs of the income-driven repayment program at the request of wyoming republican mike enzi , chairman of the senate budget committee .     the obama administration made enrolling student loan borrowers in income-driven repayment plans a major tool for assisting borrowers struggling with student loan debt . the original income-driven repayment program predated the administration , but the obama department of education oversaw the addition of several new , more generous repayment programs . and it ramped up efforts to enroll student borrowers in those programs as total outstanding loan debt ballooned in recent years .     on the campaign trail , president-elect donald trump spoke favorably about income-driven repayment plans , saying in one speech that \u201cstudents should not be asked to pay more on their loans than they can afford. \u201d he proposed in a speech a repayment program that would be even more generous than the programs already available to student loan borrowers .     data released by the department of education this year indicated that those programs have seen steady increases in enrollment . almost 4.6 million federal direct borrowers had enrolled in income-driven repayment plans by december 2015 -- up 48 percent from 2014 and 140 percent from 2013. as of june , 5.3 million borrowers had enrolled in one of those plans .     but according to the gao \u2019 s report , the cost of each successive loan cohort has been greater than the one that preceded it since 2012. and the fiscal 2017 cohort of student loans is expected to carry a cost five times that of the 2012 cohort .     the higher-than-expected costs of income-driven repayment are a result of multiple flaws in the cost estimate methods used by the department , according to the report :     the department assumed no existing student borrowers would switch to income-driven plans .     until 2015 , the department assumed no borrowers of graduate plus loans , which are uncapped , would switch to income-driven plans .     the department \u2019 s estimates assumed no growth in enrollment , even as the obama administration was seeking to enroll two million additional borrowers in the plans .     the gao concludes that the department has consistently underestimated the value of subsidies going to income-driven repayment plans in each year . it also reports that the cost estimates used by the department of education lack appropriate transparency .     alexander holt , a policy analyst with the education policy program at new america , said the report showed the department has no business being involved in budgeting the repayment program .     \u201cthis is insane incompetence , \u201d he said . \u201cif you go through the report , there are just basic things that they missed or that they didn \u2019 t do. \u201d     jason delisle , a resident fellow who specializes in higher ed finance at the american enterprise institute , said the report was a vote of no confidence in the department \u2019 s abilities to estimate what income-driven repayment will cost taxpayers .     \u201creally what the gao is saying is that the obama administration \u2019 s expansion of this program has been done without good information about the effects , \u201d delisle said .     under secretary of education ted mitchell said income-driven repayment plans are helping millions of borrowers successfully manage loan repayment , particularly those who find standard repayment challenging .     \u201cidr plans also help keep borrowers from financial strain and reduce default , which can wreak havoc on struggling families ' credit rating and ability to get back on their feet , \u201d mitchell said in a statement . \u201cthe department of education has proposed several common-sense reforms that would reduce costs by about $ 49 billion over 10 years , and taken action to protect students and taxpayers from colleges that are failing students by leaving them with unaffordable debt and poor employment outcomes , ensuring they either improve or risk losing access to the federal student aid programs. \u201d     the department of education oversees a $ 1.3 trillion loan portfolio and $ 150 billion annually in new loans . jessica thompson , the policy and research director at the institute for college access and success , said it was important to put the numbers in the report in that context . thompson said income-driven repayment programs were designed to be a safety net for students who couldn \u2019 t repay their loan debt after many years . she also said the gao report showed important fixes that the department of education could make in its cost estimates .     policy experts have criticized the administration \u2019 s changes to the program for making income-driven plans more generous to graduate student borrowers , who have some of the highest volumes of student loan debt but are best positioned to pay off their student loans . income-driven plans are the basis for public service loan forgiveness , which goes into effect next year . and a large proportion of loan debt being repaid through income-driven plans is driven by the graduate plus program or graduate stafford loans , delisle said .     it \u2019 s possible that republican lawmakers looking to tackle the costs associated with the programs could take steps like capping the amount of loan debt that can be taken out for graduate studies , eliminating public service loan forgiveness or otherwise limiting student borrowing .     a spokeswoman for tennessee republican senator lamar alexander , chairman of the senate education committee , said the gao report raises concerns about the costs of income-driven repayment programs .     \u201cin the upcoming higher education act reauthorization , senator alexander looks forward to working with senator enzi and committee republicans and democrats on re-evaluating , simplifying and better targeting these repayment plans to reduce these costs and better protect the taxpayer , while still providing a manageable repayment option for borrowers , \u201d the spokeswoman said .\n"}, {"url": "file://train/56/1/0", "title": "train/56/1/0", "content": "prince george

single mortgage payment on the showcase home along the potomac river after buying it at the end of 2006.     sheriff \u2019 s deputies showed up at the house wednesday morning with an eviction order issued last week by the county circuit court . the order had been sought by kondaur capital corp. , a california firm that buys foreclosed properties and now owns the house .     the ritters could not be reached for comment .     during the real estate boom , the ritters earned six-figure incomes by flipping houses \u2014 buying and reselling rapidly . most of their activity was in the fort washington area . the ritters ran into financial trouble once the housing bubble burst . they had said previously that they did not make payments because they were scrambling to save other investment properties from foreclosure .     the mortgage on the million-dollar house passed through several lenders , at least two of which tried to foreclose . the ritters held them off with repeated bankruptcy filings in different states , temporarily halting the foreclosure process . they also benefited from a national moratorium on foreclosures following the     robo-signing scandal and from maryland \u2019 s unusually long foreclosure process , one of the most protracted in the nation .     attorneys for kondaur successfully foreclosed on the house late last year and obtained an eviction order in december . in march , after an article about the couple appeared in the washington post , sheriff \u2019 s deputies pulled up to the house but had to leave because of another last-minute bankruptcy filing by janet ritter . kondaur \u2019 s lawyers last week secured the court order that allowed the eviction to go forward .     the ritters had filled their home with art and furnishings . one witness to the eviction said it took the entire day to remove the couple \u2019 s belongings .     by friday afternoon , the front door sported a new lock and a real estate lock box . there were

vandalized .     neighbors in the small development of custom-built , high-end homes were reluctant to talk to a reporter about the eviction . one man , who did not give his name , said , \u201cthis
