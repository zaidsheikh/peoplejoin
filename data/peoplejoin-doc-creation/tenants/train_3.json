peter smith stands up for airline passengers everywhere     a document appearing to be the full transcript of a judge \u2019 s bench badgering of british airways over his lost luggage has emerged .     fleet street last week cast the chancery court \u2019 s mr justice peter smith \u2014 whom the times newspaper described as \u201cone of the legal profession \u2019 s more colourful figures \u201d \u2014 as the common air travellers hero after he castigated lawyers for the \u201cworld \u2019 s favourite airline \u201d .     but the bench-slapping had nothing to do with their submissions in the \u00a3 3 billion lawsuit smith was hearing \u2014 a spat in which ba was accused of colluding to fix air cargo charges . instead it related to an entirely unrelated incident which had seen smith \u2019 s luggage go missing on a ba flight during a recent trip to italy .     legal cheek cannot verify the authenticity of the document that is doing the rounds of legal london . however , it appears to be a comprehensive transcript of the court stenographer \u2019 s note .     emerald supplies ltd v british airways     taking the brunt of smith \u2019 s ire was jon turner , a silk of nine years \u2019 standing from monkton chambers in gray \u2019 s inn . as ba \u2019 s lead counsel on the day , turner came in for repeated questioning regarding the loss of smith \u2019 s luggage during his recent trip florence .     at one stage the judge threatened to haul ba \u2019 s pugnacious irish chief executive , willie walsh , before the court to answer some pretty searching questions on the missing luggage front . sadly that didn \u2019 t happen , as it would have been one hell of a bout .     now , smith is no stranger to courtroom antics . the judge once famously inserted his own coded message into a judgment he handed down on a copyright case concerning best-selling thriller novel \u201cthe da vince code \u201d .     in the most recent case , according to the transcript , smith repeatedly cross-examined ba \u2019 s lawyers about the lost luggage , while , in turn , they desperately tried to bring the proceedings back to the matter of the trial .     in the end , frustrated lawyers , who included the airline \u2019 s law firm , slaughter and may ( whose partners presumably know a thing or two about international holiday travel ) , applied for smith to recuse himself . the grounds were clear : anyone so arsed off with one of the litigants \u2014 no matter how legitimately in a customer service context \u2014 would not be able to hear case impartially .     smith adamantly disagreed , but he stood down nonetheless . he didn \u2019 t go quietly , telling the court :     i do not believe for one minute that the reasonably minded observer \u2026 would think that merely because i have raised issues over the non-delivery of my luggage of itself should lead to the possibility of bias . i believe a reasonably minded observer would see a judge with a problem trying to resolve that issue and finding the parting question being obstructive and unwilling to address the issue and find a solution . a simple dispute as to the luggage cannot possible be grounds for recusal . however , ba and its solicitors have simply escalated the problem almost immediately .     nonetheless , smith saw the writing on the wall in terms of public perception :     i however cannot allow my presence in the case and its difficulties to distract the parties from this case . and therefore , regretfully , i feel that i have no choice , whatever my feelings about it , but to recuse myself from the case \u2026     ba \u2019 s legal team will be relieved . the rest of us will still shed a tiny tear as the case of emerald supplies ltd v british airways is destined to be a

flight while he was presiding over an unrelated dispute involving the same airline .     mr justice peter smith , one of the country \u2019 s most senior judges , withdrew from the \u00a3 3 billion case amid accusations of bias , after he raised the matter of his missing luggage in his own court room .     a new judge will now be appointed to preside over the case , over a european commission ruling that ba was guilty of colluding to fix air cargo charges .     the high court judge was hearing a dispute involving ba , tens of thousands of firms and 30 other airlines , which dates back to 2006 ,     by coincide he had sent emails to ba \u2019 s chairman using his judicial title after his baggage went missing on a recent trip to italy , in which he accused airline staff of deliberately leaving behind all the plane \u2019 s luggage and deceiving passengers .     the judge \u2019 s bags \u2018spontaneously \u2019 turned up at his home last week .     but mr justice smith went on to raise the matter in court , threatening to order ba \u2019 s chief executive to appear in front of him to explain how a whole aeroplane \u2019 s luggage could go missing     he told ba \u2019 s legal team , led by jon turner qc : \u201cright , mr turner , here is a question for you : what happened to [ the ] luggage ? \u201d     but when the barrister replied that they were not dealing with that issue mr justice smith persisted with his line of questioning , saying : \u201ci am asking you \u2013 what has happened to the luggage ? \u201d     mr turner again declined to address his request , at which point mr justice smith warned : \u201cin that case , do you want me to order your chief executive to appear before me today ? \u201d     despite being told it would not be appropriate to discuss a personal dispute , the judge persisted : \u201cwhat is inappropriate is the continued failure of your clients to explain a simple question , namely , what happened to the luggage ? it has been two weeks since that happened. \u201d     he added : \u201ci do not believe for a minute that the reasonably-minded observer would think that merely because i had raised issues about the non-delivery of my luggage , that it should raise the possibility of bias. \u201d     but when ba \u2019 s legal team applied for the judge to stand aside mr justice smith he agreed .     one of the legal circuit \u2019 s more colourful characters mr justice smith once hid a message in a high court judgment relating to the da vinci code copyright trial .     in 2006 , he ruled in favour of the novel \u2019 s author , dan brown , after rival authors michael baigent and richard leigh sued publisher random house , claiming he had stolen their ideas .     italicised letters in the first seven paragraphs of the judgment spelt out \u2018smithy code \u2019 in a reference to his own name .     other apparently randomly italicised letters read : \u201cjackie fisher , who are you ? dreadnought \u201d . this appeared to relate to one of the judge \u2019 s own interests \u2013 admiral lord fisher , who designed the battleship hms dreadnought .     it was thought to be the first time that a message had been hidden in a formal high court judgment .     mr justice smith refused to confirm that the letters were a code at the time , saying only : \u201cthey don ' t look like typos , do they ? i can ' t discuss the judgment , but i don ' t see why a judgment should not be a matter of fun. \u201d     in may this year mr justice smith blamed a father for the horrific injuries that led to the death of the man ' s baby daughter , even though the man was cleared by a jury .     he lifted the normal anonymity rules that apply to family court judgments to name martin thomas , 30 , as responsible for brutal attacks on four-month-old evie thomas from wigan , greater manchester .     the judge said the law would be \u201ca screen to hide the truth \u201d if the father was allowed to remain unnamed .     in 2010 mr justice smith was due to oversee a \u00a3 100million trial over the controversial chelsea barracks development , but was replaced at the last moment after reportedly upsetting the qatari royal family .     he had overseen the pre-trial hearings involving qatari diar , the property arm of the qatari royal family , which was sued by christian candy , a london property tycoon , for breach of contract .     but the qataris were said to be upset when a number of decisions went against them .     it was later ruled that the royal family ' s property company had breached its contract when it withdrew a planning application for the \u00a3 3bn chelsea barracks development after the intervention of prince charles .\n"}], "farshid": [{"url": "file://train/3/2/1", "title":

regulations \u201d . mrs justice vivien rose has been appointed to hear the case in his place .     the remarkable courtroom exchanges took place during one of the biggest competition battles to reach the uk courts . the case stems from a european commission ruling that ba and a number of other airlines colluded to fix air cargo charges , with the firms now being sued by hundreds of companies for losses and damages .     will gant , a reporter for the specialist legal magazine parr , witnessed the judge \u2019 s outburst . \u201ci \u2019 ve been a court journalist for several years , and must have seen thousands of hearings , but frankly i was absolutely blown away by the unprofessional attitude that mr justice peter smith displayed at this one , \u201d he told the independent .     \u201cthe room was packed with dozens of lawyers , and two or three reporters from specialist legal publications , and as this unfolded we all silently exchanged looks of complete amazement . i \u2019 ve never seen a judge allow their personal life to affect their work like this , and it was sad to watch . it was an embarrassment to british justice. \u201d     another source familiar with the case added : \u201cfrankly , it \u2019 s the sort of thing you might expect in other areas of the world , but not here. \u201d     in a parting shot , mr justice smith then used a written judgment to chastise ba still further , suggesting that his luggage and that of his fellow passengers had been \u201cdeliberately bumped off for a more profitable cargo \u201d . he had emailed ba \u2019 s chairman , keith williams , because he felt the incident \u201cmight be something that is strikingly similar to some of the allegations in this case \u201d , he wrote .     he continued : \u201ci do not believe for one minute that the reasonably minded observer \u2026 would think that merely because i have raised issues over the non delivery of my luggage of itself should lead to the possibility of bias. \u201d he also warned ba that he would continue his investigation into what happened to the bags \u201cin a private capacity \u201d and \u201cwith the vigour for which i am known \u201d .     both british airways and its legal advisers , slaughter &amp; may , declined to comment .     court records : out of order     according to a transcript , mr justice peter smith repeatedly harangued the british airways barrister jon turner qc about what happened to his missing luggage . here are some edited extracts :     mr justice peter smith : right , mr turner , here is a question for you . what happened to [ the ] luggage ?     jon turner : my lord , the position remains that set out in the letter from slaughter and may of 15 july , that we are not dealing with that as parties in these proceedings .     ps : i am asking you : what has happened to the luggage ?     jt : my lord , so far as the parties to these proceedings \u2026 are concerned , we have said , and we maintain , that we are not getting involved because we trust that that will be dealt with expeditiously , in the ordinary course of events .     ps : in that case , do you want me to order your chief executive to appear before me today ?     jt : i do not wish your lordship to do that ; and i would say , if your lordship will permit me to develop my submissions , that that would be an inappropriate mixture of a personal dispute ...     ps : what is inappropriate is the continued failure of your clients to explain a simple question , namely , what happened to the luggage ? it has been two weeks since that happened now ....     jt : our position , my lord , is that where your lordship initiates a personal dispute with british airways \u2026     ps : i didn \u2019 t initiate a personal dispute . ba \u2019 s associated company retained my luggage . it is not my fault that that happened . i am the victim . i read the whole of your correspondence . the more i read it , i got the impression that ba was trying to portray itself of the victim of this case and being oppressed by wicked mr justice peter smith . it is just ridiculous ...     ps : as far as i am concerned , the key fact in this case is : what happened to the luggage ; and your clients know what happened to the luggage and they are not telling me . and your solicitors and you are deliberately not asking ...     ps : if there is a perfectly understandable operational reason as to why the whole of the flight \u2019 s luggage was left behind in florence ... then i will accept that . that has been my stance ever since i contacted the chairman . i contacted the chairman because the ba helpline is misdescribed . because when i contacted them , they said , \u201cit is nothing to do with us , it is down to vueling [ ba \u2019 s spanish partner airline ] \u201d , despite the fact that i booked my flight with ba and ba took my money . the vueling helpline was even worse . they couldn \u2019 t even tell me where the luggage was till it , without warning , spontaneously arrived at my house last thursday . in those circumstances , i went to the ba website and the ba website says the chairman is anxious to have comments from customers , and there is his email address , so i sent him an email . apparently he likes reading customers \u2019 emails . it doesn \u2019 t appear to be necessarily he does anything about it , but he obviously likes reading them over his breakfast ...     ps : ba as a group , as a company in a group , clearly know what happened to the luggage , because ... they cannot have accidentally left the whole of the flight \u2019 s luggage off the plane , can they ? i mean , i am intrigued . it might be for some reason they only had three gallons of fuel in the plane , it would run out unless they took everything off , which is a bit difficult because the plane was actually being refuelled when we got there . but equally , it is impossible to believe that the pilot , who has to sign the documentation as to what is the weight and composition of the weight in the plane , did not know that his hold was empty ; and it is equally impossible for the ground staff not to know that the luggage was not there . these are things which , i accept , i am struggling to find a rational explanation for .\n"}]}, "user_id_to_descriptions": {"alice": "Is interested in compiling a summary.",
