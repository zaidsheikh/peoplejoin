that very rarely survives on shipwreck sites \u2013 paper .     during conservation work on artifacts recovered from the wreckage of queen anne \u2019 s revenge , flagship of the pirate blackbeard , 16 tiny fragments of paper were discovered in a mass of wet sludge removed from the chamber for a breech-loading cannon . the largest fragment was only about the size of a quarter . paper is an extremely rare material to find on shipwrecks , especially one 300 years old , because it usually disintegrates very quickly under water .     qar lab conservators are working with specialist paper conservators and scientists from the department \u2019 s division of archives and records , along with the winterthur/university of delaware program in art conservation , to conserve the very fragile paper fragments . as the work progressed another discovery was made \u2013 that there was still legible printed text on some of the fragments , although only a few words were visible . the challenge then became not just to conserve the paper fragments , but also to identify where they were from .     after many months of research , the fragments were determined to be from a 1712 first edition of a book by captain edward cooke , \u201ca voyage to the south sea , and round the world , perform \u2019 d in the years 1708 , 1709 , 1710 and 1711. \u201d     cooke \u2019 s book was a \u201cvoyage

also published an account of the expedition , and who was later sent in 1718 as royal governor to rid the bahamas of pirates .     voyage narratives were popular literature in the late 17th and early 18th centuries , inspiring new voyages both real and fictional . both cooke \u2019 s and rogers \u2019 works describe the rescue of alexander selkirk from an island on which he had been marooned for four years . selkirk \u2019 s story became the inspiration for daniel defoe \u2019 s 1719 novel , \u201crobinson crusoe. \u201d although books like these voyage narratives would have been relatively common on ships of the early 18th century , archaeological evidence for them is exceedingly rare , and this find represents a glimpse into the reading habits of a pirate crew .     this unique find from the wreckage of queen anne \u2019 s revenge provides archaeological evidence for books carried on ships in the early 18th century , and adds to our knowledge of the history of blackbeard \u2019 s

notorious 18th-century pirate blackbeard apparently enjoyed a rollicking read , according to an unlikely discovery in a cannon chamber .     a handful of paper scraps recovered from the wreck of queen anne ' s revenge have been identified as fragments of the 1712 book a voyage to the south sea , and round the world , perform \u2019 d in the years 1708 , 1709 , 1710 and 1711 , by captain edward cooke .     the discovery was announced thursday during a presentation by conservators from the queen anne \u2019 s revenge ( qar ) conservation lab at the annual meeting of the society of historical archaeology held in new orleans .     queen anne ' s revenge went aground outside of what is now beaufort , north carolina , in 1718 , and blackbeard was killed while battling british naval forces in the pamlico sound a few months later . the wreck of the pirate ' s flagship was found by private salvagers in 1996 and excavation by the north carolina department of natural and cultural resources began a year later .     the fragments were embedded in a wet mass of textile scraps removed from a breech-loading cannon chamber during its cleaning and conservation in 2016 , according to qar lab conservator erik farrell . the wad , blackened with gunpowder residue , may have served as a gasket for the wooden tampion , a plug that protected the cannon muzzle from the elements .     sixteen paper fragments , none larger than a u.s. quarter , were eventually identified , and seven of the fragments had legible text . as conservators gently pried the fragments of paper apart , they noticed that the text on successive layers was running in the same direction , leading them to suspect that they had the remains of several pages from the same book .     eventually , they could make out words including \" south \" and fathom , \" which suggested the fragments may have come from some sort of maritime or navigational text . but there was a particular word that led to the book ' s ultimate identification , says qar lab conservator kimberly kenyon .     view images a paper fragment , cleaned and dried after removal from the cannon chamber , reveals text . photograph courtesy n.c. department of natural and cultural resources     \" there was one really key word that stood out : ' hilo . ' it was very distinctive and italicized , which might indicate a place name , \" kenyon tells national geographic .     \" it really was luck . \"     armed with the distinctive clue , qar lab conservators reached out to johanna green , a specialist in the history of printed text at the university of glasgow . while the researchers ruled out accounts of hilo , hawaii , which didn ' t appear in european literature until after james cook ' s expedition of 1778 , green pointed out earlier english-language mentions of the spanish settlement of ilo on the peruvian coast .     the earliest accounts came from english sailors involved in attacking ilo during pacific voyages . stories about the plunder of spanish holdings were popular in the 17th and 18th centuries , says kenyon . \" the english audiences were eating this up . \"     when these printed accounts didn ' t match with the book fragments from queen anne ' s revenge , the researchers looked to other stories of pacific voyages that referenced the plunder of ilo and eventually determined that their bits of paper came from pages 177 , 178 , and 183-188 of the 1712 first edition of captain edward cooke ' s a voyage to the south sea , and round the world , perform \u2019 d in the years 1708 , 1709 , 1710 and 1711.     cooke ' s book describes his experiences on an expedition made by two ships , duke and dutchess , led by captain woodes rogers . rogers also published an account of the voyage , and both books describe the rescue of alexander selkirk from an island on which he had been marooned for four years .

archaeological analysis , national geographic grantee david mearns has successfully discovered one of vasco da gama ' s ships lost at sea in 1503 off the coast of present-day oman .     historical accounts show that at least some members of a pirate crew were often literate . officers would have needed to read navigational charts , kenyon observes . she also points to accounts of buccaneers pilfering books from seized ships , and even a mention of blackbeard ' s diary , which was stolen after his death .     the team of qar lab conservators is working with specialist paper conservators and scientists from the north carolina department of natural and cultural resources division of archives and records , along with the winterthur/university of delaware program in art conservation , to conserve the very fragile paper fragments , and a display about the find is being planned as part of the department \u2019 s blackbeard 300th anniversary events during 2018.     the remains of a voyage to the south sea take their place among other notable artifacts from the wreck of queen anne ' s revenge , including the ship ' s bell , an ornamental sword , and even the remains of a delicate pocket watch . with some 100,000 of the 400,000 artifacts raised from the wreck so far still awaiting conservation , kenyon is confident that more remarkable discoveries from blackbeard ' s ship are yet to come from the qar lab .\n"}, {"url": "file://val/45/0/1", "title": "val/45/0/1", "content": "old-timey pirates are typically portrayed as stupid , unrefined thugs whose only interests involved plundering captured ships and forcing enemies to walk the plank . the recent discovery of legible text on paper pulled from the cannon of blackbeard \u2019 s flagship paints a strikingly different picture of these misunderstood sailors .     work by conservationists from north carolina \u2019 s department of natural and cultural resources shows that blackbeard and his crew got a kick out of reading \u201cvoyage narratives \u201d \u2014 a popular form of literature in the late 17th and early 18th century that chronicled the true accounts of maritime expeditions . specifically , blackbeard kept a copy of edward cooke \u2019 s a voyage to the south sea , and round the world , perform \u2019 d in the years 1708 , 1709 , 1710 and 1711 , detailing the british naval officer \u2019 s

slave ship ( the french had stolen the merchant ship from its original british owners in 1711 , when it was called the concord ) . the dreaded pirate gave the vessel a new name , added 40 guns , and

conservation lab researchers worked to preserve and study the fragments . as work progressed , it became clear that some of the fragments still contained traces of legible printed text . after months of research , the bits of paper were sourced back to the first edition of cooke \u2019 s book , published in 1712.     as noted , voyage narratives were a popular genre at the time , often inspiring both real and fictional voyages . cooke \u2019 s book describes the rescue of alexander selkirk , who had been marooned on an island for four years \u2014 an account that inspired daniel defoe \u2019 s 1719 novel robinson crusoe .     the discovery provides evidence of the kinds of books carried on ships in the early 18th century \u2014 pirate ships included . it also tells us a bit more about blackbeard and his crew ; it \u2019 s considered the first archaeological evidence of the presence of a specific book aboard the queen anne \u2019 s revenge . of course , we don \u2019 t know if blackbeard , whose real name was edward teach , actually read the book .     advertisement     that blackbeard had books like this on his ship shouldn \u2019 t come as a surprise . he may have read the book as entertainment , helping to pass away the long hours at sea . but he may have also read cooke \u2019 s accounts to get fresh ideas about new places to plunder .     blackbeard had a fearsome reputation , no doubt , but there was another side to him as well . historian david m. ullian of amherst college explains :     blackbeard often fought , or simply showed himself , wearing a big feathered tricorn , and having multiple swords , knives , and pistols at his disposal . it was reported in the general history of the pirates that he had hemp and lighted matches woven into his enormous black beard during battle . accounts of people who saw him fighting say that they thought he \u2018looked like the devil \u2019 with his fearsome face and the smoke cloud around his head . this image , which he cultivated , has made him the premier image of the seafaring pirate .     advertisement     but the image blackbeard portrayed to his victims was in defiance of the man himself , who was described as shrewd , calculating , and surprisingly merciful . as ullian writes , \u201cironically , despite his ferocious reputation , there are no verified accounts of him actually killing anyone . he generally prevailed by fear alone. \u201d     [ nc department of natural and cultural resources ]\n"}, {"url": "file://val/45/1/0", "title": "val/45/1/0", "content": "raleigh , n.c.
