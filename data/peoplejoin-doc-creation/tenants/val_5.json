( credit : cbs/sprint )     if history is any indication , sprint will have to make some tough decisions , if apple ' s blockbuster device starts weighing on its network . it ' s something the other carriers have done , and it ' s part of a broader trend of telecommunication companies struggling to keep up with growing bandwidth consumption .     after suffering through years of heavy bandwidth usage from iphone users , at&t ; relented and switched to a tiered pricing plan last year . it only took verizon wireless a few months after launching its version of the iphone 4 before it opted to apply similar data caps .     sprint , which the wall street journal reported today will be getting the iphone 5 at the same time as at&t ; and verizon in october , will likely follow the same path .     i have no first-hand knowledge of sprint ' s thinking on its successful -- but taxing -- offer of an all-you-can-eat data plan for its smartphones . a sprint representative wasn ' t immediately available to answer my questions .     but i do know that networks aren ' t fundamentally different from each other , despite the marketing jargon and hype that surrounds them . sprint doesn ' t have any more capacity than verizon and at&t . ; in fact , it may be in a worse position now because its unlimited-data offer is unique in the market , likely attracting the heaviest of users .     the carriers ' switch to tiered plans doesn ' t include existing unlimited-data customers , who have had the option to be grandfathered into an unlimited plan . you can see the strain the grandfathering is putting on the carriers , with both at&t ; and verizon switching to language in their service agreements that allow them to throttle , or choke off , the connection speed when a user exceeds a certain threshold of data consumption .     sprint is in a touchy spot because it has positioned itself as the unlimited carrier . ads talk about the company ' s truly limitless plans , and chief executive dan hesse has been featured on commercials deriding competitors ' actions such as throttling .     as i ' ve written , verizon ' s decision to switch to a capped plan has been a boon for sprint . the carrier is the only remaining company to offer a truly unlimited-data plan , a rare marketing and competitive edge outside of cheaper prices . even sprint ' s prepaid arm , virgin mobile , has decided to employ throttling .     but all good things have to come to an end . speaking to a roundtable of bloggers and reporters last month , hesse acknowledged that data traffic could eventually be an issue .     \" nothing ' s a guarantee that it ' s forever , \" he said at the time .     for sprint , the choice is a trade-off : keep the unlimited-data plan and spur additional customer growth , or cut back on the plans and ease the need to invest in more capital for the network . its decision may indicate whether it is favoring the consumer or wall street .     when i wrote about sprint eventually dropping the unlimited-data plan , analysts gave it a year to 18 months before a change would happen . but with the iphone becoming available to sprint customers , that timetable could be accelerated . thanks to its more affordable data plans , sprint has a higher base of smartphone customers than its rivals -- roughly half of its total customers .     while it has gotten used to dealing with the bandwidth-intensive android phone , sprint may be in for another pounding , once more customers start upgrading their basic phones for the iphone .     and even if the iphone isn ' t significantly more data-hungry than its android counterparts , sprint may use the iphone ' s reputation as an excuse to close off the unlimited-data spigot .     so what does that mean for customers ? if the iphone does come out for sprint , hop on an unlimited-data plan while you can ( and thus get grandfathered in ) . the plan may not be around much longer .\n"}, {"url": "file://val/5/1/3", "title": "val/5/1/3", "content": "we don \u2019 t ask much of the primetime emmy awards . nobody ever gets one of these three-hour statuette dispensaries completely right , but the emmys always seem as though they \u2019 d be the easiest of all the awards shows to pull off \u2014 mostly because the likelihood of culturally disruptive twerking is very , very low , which means the emmys are the awards show no one ever remembers 18 hours later .     so what happened sunday night during cbs \u2019 s anemic and often awkward emmys telecast , hosted by neil patrick harris ?

chalk it up to tonal inconsistency ? misconceived production numbers ? too many protracted pretaped segments at the expense of spontaneity ? an overload of solemnity ?     perhaps don cheadle inadvertently hit it on the head during a look back a half-century to the momentous events of 1963 , when he acknowledged \u201ctelevision \u2019 s active role in allowing us to mourn collectively and begin to heal. \u201d that \u2019 s a noble sentiment in the intended context of the john f. kennedy assassination . but in such a moribund ceremony , any mention of mourning felt awkwardly appropriate . it didn \u2019 t take the breaking bad meth dancers -- yes , really -- to point up the uncomfortable paradox of television \u2019 s best being celebrated in a night of spectacularly messy tv .     photos : emmys ' best and worst moments     as the man in the firing line , neil patrick harris will likely cop a lot of flak . but with so many blundering producing decisions intruding on his limited time at the podium , the host didn \u2019 t really stand a chance .     harris has four lauded turns as tony awards emcee under his belt , plus a previous gig fronting the emmys in 2009. he knows what he \u2019 s doing . his insouciant irreverence hit the mark in an intro segment in which he binge-watched the entire tv season . ditto when his opening monologue was hijacked by previous hosts ( jimmy kimmel , jane lynch , jimmy fallon , conan o \u2019 brien ) and by front-row hecklers tina fey and amy poehler , demanding that he strip down and start twerking . making that sabotage part of the master plan of kevin spacey , in character as house of cards \u2019 reptilian frank underwood , was a droll touch . and somehow harris \u2019 humor and charm failed to provide much glue . ( truth be told , he was also part of the producing team , which makes him far from blameless. )     the expected opening song-and-dance number failed to materialize until midshow . by the time it did , the mood had been so thoroughly flattened that harris , 16 back-up dancers , nathan fillion and sarah silverman faced an uphill battle to milk much amusement out of the routine glitz of \u201cthe number in the middle of the show. \u201d even worse was the choreography segment , with a faux-reality setup leading to thematic dance numbers for each of the drama nominees -- a throwback to the good old , bad old days when debbie allen choreographed the oscars .     photos : emmys red carpet arrivals     when harris \u2019 how i met your mother castmates turned up in a pretaped mock-infomercial for the ryan seacrest center for excessive hosting disorder , dragging in arsenio hall as part of their intervention , the irony was agonizing .     too often , such labored filler segments merely ate up time , meaning the award recipients were played off almost as soon as they began speaking . shorter acceptance speeches normally are a good thing , a memo that nurse jackie winner merritt wever appeared to have gotten with her succinct : \u201cthank you so much . i gotta go . bye. \u201d but a few more discursive comments might have helped stave off the weird pall that hung over much of the ceremony .     in one inspired bit early on , hale returned to the stage soon after his supporting actor in a comedy win for veep , sycophantically flanking his \u201cboss , \u201d julia louis-dreyfus , when she was honored for the same show . cutting to their co-star anna chlumsky madly texting in the audience only made the joke funnier . michael douglas also scored some laughs with his innuendo-laden acceptance speech for behind the candelabra , acknowledging that the movie was a \u201ctwo-hander \u201d and giving his co-star matt damon the choice of \u201cthe bottom or the top \u201d for his half of the award . gracious remarks by class acts such as james cromwell and ellen burstyn were like invigorating breaths of fresh air -- likewise the welcome appearances of bob newhart , who showed that less is more .     photos : thr ' s emmys instagram photos     but every moment of genuine levity had to contend with another deep plunge into self-important sobriety . spreading the \u201cin memoriam \u201d salutes throughout the show was a large part of that problem , laying such a thick carpet of gloom that it made much of harris \u2019 material seem smug .     during the runup to sunday \u2019 s ceremony , news that glee star cory monteith was to be given a special tribute prompted some discontent , suggesting that , by contrast , lumping such iconic faces as jack klugman and larry hagman into the collective obit was doing those tv veterans a disservice . but it was impossible not to be moved by the heartfelt sincerity of jane lynch \u2019 s salute to her late glee co-star .     other tributes included michael j. fox \u2019 s bow to family ties creator gary david goldberg ; robin williams \u2019 nod to fellow comedian jonathan winters , with whom he worked on mork &amp; mindy ; edie falco \u2019 s tearful farewell to her sopranos husband james gandolfini ; and most affecting of all , rob reiner \u2019 s loving words for his all in the family mother-in-law , jean stapleton . in a year of countless sad losses for television , the emmys clearly set out to acknowledge the passing of key figures who touched different generations . the intention was honorable , even if some major names ended up seeming like also-rans . but the complete absence of clips from either the standalone tributes or the group acknowledgement robbed them of emotional resonance .     photos : emmys fashion : the top 10 best dressed     the 1963 remembrance was too rushed to have much impact , playing like a promo for a more interesting pbs special . the first-ever african-american emmy acting nominee , diahann carroll , appeared onstage with this year \u2019 s contender kerry washington to acknowledge how far television had come in terms of racial inclusiveness . but again , this gesture was more symbolic than meaningful .     in the evening \u2019 s most anticipated musical interlude , elton john donned one of his old glittery captain fantastic jackets to pay tribute to liberace . but the choice of a forgettable new song with only the most tenuous connection to the behind the candelabra subject made this another black hole in a ceremony littered with them .     the big drag at the emmys has always been the deja vu factor of the same winners year after year . claire danes again ?

( to quote patton oswalt : \u201cthat was one soul-crushing slab of televised darkness . over on cable , however , @breakingbad_amc was amazing. \u201d ) how could it be , with the steady stream of in-memoriam segments that stopped just long enough for a series of less relevant downers including , but not limited to , a beatles cover performed by carrie underwood , a u.s.-history lesson from don cheadle , and a tribute to liberace by elton john ? it was all so torturous that when bob newhart interrupted the downcast proceeding , we don \u2019 t even remember what for , al pacino \u2014 looking as though he had just roused himself from a two-hour slumber \u2014 led the audience in a standing ovation , as if to say , \u201cyay for the living ! \u201d         but somewhere in all of that emmy muckety-muck , there were some genuinely brilliant surprises . the first being merritt wever \u2019 s very deserved , but very unexpected , win in the supporting-actress-in-a-comedy category for her work on nurse jackie . up against modern family favorites sof\u00eda vergara and julie bowen , the young actress was so shocked by the win that all she could mutter at the podium was , \u201cthanks so much . i gotta go , bye. \u201d a close second in the awesome-acceptance-speech department came from julia louis-dreyfus , who collected her comedic-actress emmy with veep co-star ( and supporting comedic-actor winner ) tony hale in tow . assuming the role of gary , louis-dreyfus \u2019 s aide on the hbo series , hale stood behind her while she accepted her emmy to hold her bag ( a recurring veep joke ) and remind her to thank her family .     joining wever with their own surprise wins were jeff daniels in the dramatic-actor category ( where he was up against such heavy-hitting nominees as mad men \u2019 s jon hamm , breaking bad \u2019 s bryan cranston , and homeland \u2019 s damian lewis ) and boardwalk empire \u2019 s bobby cannavale in the dramatic-supporting-actor race ( which featured breaking bad \u2019 s aaron paul , homeland \u2019 s mandy patinkin , and game of thrones \u2019 peter dinklage ) . like last year , modern family won the best-comedy-series title , and claire danes took the best-dramatic-actress award for homeland . in groundbreaking developments , netflix secured its first emmy , for direction of a drama series , which went to david fincher for house of cards . michael douglas predictably took the best-actor-in-a-miniseries-or-movie trophy for his portrayal of liberace in hbo \u2019 s behind the candelabra . explaining that he wanted to split his award with co-star matt damon , who played liberace \u2019 s real-life lover scott thorson , douglas joked , \u201cmatt , you really deserve half of this . so do you want the bottom or the top ? \u201d         breaking bad won two awards \u2014 supporting actress in a drama series for anna gunn and the top drama title at the end of the night . sadly for game of thrones fans , this meant that neither emilia clarke nor the fantasy show won in their nominated categories . similarly defeated was mad men , which unfathomably failed to clinch a single award tonight . while on the subject of injustices , it seems unfair to tease emmy viewers with several minutes \u2019 worth of tina fey and amy poehler \u2014 who appeared early in the telecast to heckle host neil patrick harris \u2014 only to leave us with three relentlessly depressing hours of programming .         meanwhile , it bears noting that neil patrick harris \u2014 a consummate pro \u2014 expertly m.c. \u2019 d the proceedings , brightening them up wherever he could . unfortunately for him , emmy producers had a somewhat dour agenda for the evening , which left this viewer , at least , feeling like one of the night \u2019 s biggest losers .\n"}]}, "user_id_to_descriptions": {"alice": "Is interested in compiling a summary.", "cassie": "Knows about the following topics:\nSprint, iPhone 5, unlimited data plan, tiered pricing plan, bandwidth consumption\nEmmy Awards, Neil Patrick Harris, Breaking Bad, Merritt Wever, Jeff Daniels\n1873 dime, Carson City, auction, $1.84 million\nCarson City mint, coin auction, rare coins, Battle Born collection, Rusty Goe", "parker": "Knows about the following topics:\nEmmy Awards, Neil Patrick Harris, TV, awards show, winners\nEmmy Awards, Neil Patrick Harris, Steven Levitan, Merritt Wever, Diahann Carroll\nEmmy Awards, Merritt Wever, Jeff Daniels, Breaking Bad, Michael Douglas"}, "user_id_to_table_names": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_templated": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_lowprecision": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_lowprecision_templated": {}}
