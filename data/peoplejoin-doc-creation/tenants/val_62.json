group of senators would introduce their broad immigration legislation in the next few weeks . their bill , which they have been meeting about several times a week since the november election , would provide a path to citizenship for the 11 million illegal immigrants already in the country . it would also take steps to secure the nation \u2019 s borders .     advertisement continue reading the main story     a similar bipartisan group in the house has been meeting on and off for nearly four years , and hopes to unveil its own immigration legislation shortly .     the agreement resolved what the pay level should be for low-skilled immigrants \u2014 often employed at hotels and restaurants or on construction projects \u2014 who could be brought in during labor shortages .     labor groups wanted to ensure that guest workers would not be paid less than the median wage in their respective industries , and the two sides compromised by agreeing that guest workers would be paid the higher of the prevailing industry wage as determined by the labor department or the actual employer wage .     photo     under the deal , guest workers would be allowed to pursue a path to citizenship and to change jobs after they arrived in the united states .     another sticking point , involving the specific type of jobs that would be included in the guest worker program , was also resolved . though low-skilled construction workers will be included in the visa program , construction unions persuaded the negotiators to exclude certain types of more skilled jobs \u2014 like crane operators and electricians \u2014 from the program , officials involved in the talks said .     according to officials with the a.f.l.-c.i.o. , the program would start at 20,000 visas , rising to 35,000 visas in the second year , 55,000 in the third and 75,000 in the fourth . in the fifth year , the program would expand or shrink based on the unemployment rate , the ratio of job openings to unemployed workers and various other factors . the agreement calls for a maximum of 200,000 guest visas granted each year .     newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you ' re not a robot by

would go to businesses with fewer than 25 employees . no more than 15,000 visas per year would go to construction occupations .     business groups , which had long been pushing to allow in 400,000 such guest workers each year , will get what they regard as an adequate number to meet the needs of employers .     mr. schumer also spoke on saturday with denis mcdonough , the white house chief of staff , to update him on the agreement . president obama is eager for an overhaul of the immigration system and has threatened to step in with his own plan if congress does not move quickly with legislation of its own .     advertisement continue reading the main story     \u201cthe president continues to be encouraged by progress being made by the bipartisan group of senators , \u201d said clark stevens , a white house spokesman . \u201cwe look forward to seeing language once it is introduced , and expect legislation to move forward as soon as possible. \u201d     but senator marco rubio , republican of florida and a member of the bipartisan group , sent a letter saturday to senator patrick leahy , democrat of vermont and the chairman of the senate judiciary committee , urging against \u201cexcessive haste \u201d in considering the soon-to-be-introduced legislation . the support of voters will be crucial for passing any immigration law , mr. rubio said in the letter , and \u201cthat support can only be earned through full and careful consideration of legislative language and an open process of amendments. \u201d     shortly before the conference call on friday night between mr. schumer , mr. donohue and mr. trumka ended , one of the men suggested that the three of them get together soon for dinner ; it had been , they all agreed , a long few weeks .\n"}],

injunctions that restrict the movements of thousands of suspected gang members .     the city council voted to fund nonprofit organizations to provide job training , counseling , tattoo removal and other services that aim to help people leave the gang life . the city would pay at least $ 4.5 million but no more than $ 30 million over four years .     the proposal \u201ccreates an innovative pathway for individuals served with gang injunctions to gain the job skills they need to turn their lives around , \u201d city attorney mike feuer said in a statement .     if a court approves the settlement , the city also will stop enforcing curfew restrictions that a federal court ruled were unconstitutional and provide an expedited way for people named in injunctions to be removed from the list .     \u201cunconstitutional gang injunction curfews forced several thousand black and brown residents of los angeles indoors on a nightly basis , \u201d olu k. orange , an attorney for the lawsuit plaintiffs , said in a statement . \u201cthese individuals are part of the los angeles community and this settlement is a step by city leaders toward showing them that their lives do matter. \u201d     gang injunctions were designed as a tool for fighting gang crime and violence . they give police the power to arrest reputed gang members named in the injunction for otherwise legal activities such as gathering in public , wearing gang colors or being outside in a specified gang area late at night .     since being pioneered in los angeles in the 1980s , the use of the injunctions has proliferated across the nation and even overseas . vast swaths of southern california have been subject to such injunctions .     advocates say the injunctions have reduced gang crime while opponents say they cast too wide a net and unfairly brand young men as gang members without due process . courts have struck down portions of gang injunctions in ventura and orange counties .     the proposed los angeles settlement covers a lawsuit that was filed in 2011 by two men who were arrested for violating curfew restrictions in an injunction . the men denied they were gang members and charges against them eventually were dismissed .     their lawsuit argued that the arrests violated their constitutional rights to free assembly , travel and protection from unlawful seizures .     \u201cgang injunctions are a form of psychological abuse on a whole generation of young people of color , \u201d one of the men , christian rodriguez , said in a statement . \u201cbecause i was wrongly labeled as a gang member , i couldn \u2019 t even be outside helping my mom with the groceries at night . i got involved in this case to help others who like me , did nothing wrong but unjustly live in constant fear of doing something that might be perceived by a member of lapd as a violation. \u201d     copyright \u00a9 2016 the washington times , llc .     please enable javascript
