a republican white house , in the dfl primary election tuesday , setting up the state \u2019 s first u.s. senate race with two women nominees .     state sen. karin housley , who won the republican nomination , will face smith in the fall . \u201cit \u2019 s inspiring for all young women out there that they can make a difference , \u201d housley said of the historic matchup .     smith agreed . \u201cit is a year when women feel particularly enthusiastic about stepping into the public arena , and i think that \u2019 s a good thing , \u201d she said in an interview .     two women who won primaries tuesday in wisconsin also will square off in that state \u2019 s u.s. senate race . a record-breaking 19 women have won major-party nominations for the u.s. senate this year , according to rutgers university \u2019 s center for american women in politics .     the minnesota winner on nov. 6 will finish the final two years of former dfl sen. al franken \u2019 s term . he resigned in january amid sexual misconduct allegations . the race is crucial ; senate republicans have a one-vote edge .     smith \u2019 s victory was \u201ca testament to the trust that minnesota voters have in tina to represent their interests , \u201d dfl party chairman ken martin said in a statement .     sen. tina smith     chris hansen , director of the national republican senatorial committee , said in a statement that housley \u201chas what it takes to end left-wing democrat tina smith \u2019 s brief career \u201d in the senate .     sen. amy klobuchar won the democratic nomination easily over four little-known opponents . in her bid for a third term , she \u2019 ll face state rep. jim newberger of becker , who has served three terms in the state legislature . he defeated three republican candidates in the primary .     smith attributed her win to the fact that she \u201creally listened to people. \u201d she \u2019 ll employ the same strategy against housley , she said . \u201cthe way elections are won in minnesota is by talking to people and sharing what \u2019 s on their minds , \u201d smith said . \u201cit sounds so simple , but it really is the thing that works. \u201d     housley said she \u2019 ll continue in the fall campaign to work hard and talk about jobs , the economy , trade issues \u2019 effect on farmers , and immigration . \u201ci will continue to support our elders , \u201d she added .     she \u2019 s confident about her chances against smith . \u201ci am going to win , \u201d she said .     smith , 60 , was appointed to the seat by gov . mark dayton , whom she had served as lieutenant governor since 2015. before that , she was the dfl governor \u2019 s chief of staff . she was endorsed by the dfl .     housley , 54 , is from st. marys point . she was elected to the minnesota senate in 2012 and in 2014 lost a race for lieutenant governor .     painter , 56 , who announced in april that he was leaving the republican party , is a university of minnesota law professor . he was the chief ethics lawyer for president george w. bush from 2005 to 2007.     painter said his campaign helped call attention to ethics issues and to single-payer health care , which he endorsed . \u201cwe got a lot of attention around the country , \u201d he said in an interview . he \u2019 ll resume teaching , painter said . asked if he \u2019 d consider running for office again , he said , \u201ci don \u2019 t know . i \u2019 ll think about it. \u201d     voters interviewed at the polls tuesday said their decisions in the smith-painter race turned on support for his animosity toward president donald trump \u2014 whom he said should be impeached \u2014 or doubts about whether his dfl conversion was genuine .     in late july , the dfl \u2019 s martin publicly questioned whether painter is actually a democrat . martin described painter \u2019 s candidacy as \u201ca craven act of desperation \u201d because he is out of sync with the republican party . at the time , painter said the dfl assault proved he was \u201ca true threat to win this election. \u201d     west foster , 24 , of minneapolis , who works for a nonprofit group , voted for smith . \u201ci vote as far left as i can , and i \u2019 m not too impressed with republicans \u2014 whether they say they are or not , \u201d he said .     paul nelson , 50 , a self-employed contractor in minneapolis , was tempted by painter , but he voted for smith . \u201ci \u2019 m a party guy , \u201d he said .     when housley and smith meet in november , trump \u2019 s policies and the senator \u2019 s record will be the top issues .     smith has pledged to \u201cstand up \u201d to trump . however , she has said she doesn \u2019 t think voters \u201cwant to hear us only talking about what we don \u2019 t like about this president. \u201d     housley has tried to establish some distance between her views and style and those of the president . for example , she said this summer that she disagreed with his decision to separate immigrant families .     painter \u2019 s candidacy forced smith to focus on wooing dfl voters . meanwhile , gop-endorsed housley \u2014 who faced two candidates in the primary \u2014 made smith her sole target .     housley made frequent references to the \u201cfailed dayton-smith administration , \u201d citing mnsure and the beleaguered vehicle registration system .     cook political report , which handicaps campaigns , rates the race as a likely demo\u00adcratic win . so do inside elections and the university of virginia \u2019 s center for politics . all three groups are nonpartisan .     the fall campaign is sure to become an expensive national battlefield , with outside tv ads flooding the airwaves and national interest groups \u2019 money flowing into the race .     as of june 30 , smith had raised $ 4.8 million and housley had collected $ 1.8 million .     retired nurse patricia cohen , 75 , voted in minneapolis for smith and klobuchar because of their support for abortion rights . \u201cthere \u2019 s an assault on women \u2019 s privacy and the right to plan their families , \u201d she said . \u201cfor me that \u2019 s one of the defining issues of our time. \u201d     kerry riley , 41 , a photographer and wardrobe stylist from minneapolis , said her vote for smith was less vital than showing up to vote \u2014 especially in the current political climate . \u201cyou have to , \u201d she said .\n"}], "cassie": [{"url": "file://train/52/0/1", "title": "train/52/0/1", "content": "top donald trump campaign advisers who have taken charge of the president-elect \u2019 s transition team are casting aside much of the work on cabinet picks that new jersey gov . chris christie and his aides put in place over several months \u2014 and leaving behind a far more chaotic operation dominated by trump loyalists .     trump aides have nixed at least one christie-backed person being considered for a cabinet position in the aftermath of last friday \u2019 s shakeup , a person closely tracking the transition told politico .     story continued below     the transition team has yet to publicly release a code of ethics for itself or for nominees . and an aide to a person being considered for a top cabinet position said the person had not yet been asked to complete a detailed questionnaire to suss out red flags .     trump was slated to meet tuesday with vice president-elect mike pence , who now leads the team , to review names in hopes of announcing nominees for key cabinet posts in the coming weeks .     \" obviously , inauguration day is not getting further away , \" transition spokesman jason miller told reporters waiting in trump tower monday night . \" and people need to get going . this is an absolute top priority understood by the president-elect and the vice president-elect. \u201d     by comparison , president-elect barack obama \u2019 s transition team was deep into the vetting process by early november 2008 \u2014 not just meeting with prospective nominees but also compiling fat dossiers on them , according to emails made public through wikileaks . the obama team also released a code of ethics for transition team members just a few days after the election to limit the influence of special interests . the trump transition team , meanwhile , is full of lobbyists and has not released such a code .     \u201cit \u2019 s a lot of new people coming in the door . i \u2019 m sure their heads are spinning , with security clearances and background checks , \u201d said one transition team source . \u201cthey \u2019 re going from the footloose and fancy-free world of the campaign into the process of setting up a government . it \u2019 s a little different. \u201d     the demotion of christie and his top aides \u2014 rich bagger , christie \u2019 s former chief of staff , and william palatucci , a former christie law partner and the transition \u2019 s general counsel \u2014 sent shock waves through the team \u2019 s ranks .     bagger and palatucci worked behind the scenes for months to create a methodical operation that was less drama-filled than the new york-based campaign shop . they played a central role in hiring transition staff , developing an infrastructure , setting up policy- and agency-focused teams and culling shortlists for top administration jobs .     the shakeup \u201cdefinitely caused some confusion , \u201d said one person on trump \u2019 s transition team . \u201cthere \u2019 s been a lot of dust that \u2019 s been kicked up. \u201d     among those departing is former house intelligence chairman mike rogers , who said tuesday that the group \u2019 s work \u201cwill provide a strong foundation for the new transition team leadership as they move into the post-election phase , which naturally is incorporating the campaign team in new york who drove president-elect trump to an incredible victory last tuesday. \u201d     at one point , members of the transition team even talked with good-government types \u2014 some of them democrats , such as former obama administration ethics czar norm eisen \u2014 to think through a code of ethics for the team . \u201ci and others appealed to both sides in this election to put in these tough rules , starting in the transition , because that is where the tone is set , \u201d he said .     the transition team has not yet made public its internal code of conduct , nor did it respond to a request for comment about it .     nonetheless , trump \u2019 s closest aides are meeting with prospective candidates in hopes of announcing nominees for key cabinet posts in the coming weeks , sources told politico .     going forward , sources familiar with the team said they expect the operation to have a more top-down structure , with the president-elect \u2019 s closest advisers , such as pence , sen. jeff sessions , newly named chief of staff reince priebus , political strategist steve bannon and trump \u2019 s son-in-law jared kushner bulldozing much of the former transition leaders \u2019 existing work and making cabinet decisions on their own , in consultation with trump .     trump \u2019 s aides are focused on recruiting allies and loyalists who they have long hoped to install in top cabinet posts , such as sessions , or as treasury secretary , steven mnuchin , a trump donor and goldman sachs veteran .     one person who has talked to transition officials compared their approach to that of dick cheney , who ran george w. bush \u2019 s transition team .     \u201ccheney had his own list in his head , and he appointed the people he wanted , \u201d the person said , adding that there are factions within the trump transition \u2014 including sessions loyalists , heritage foundation wonks , trump \u2019 s campaign staff and conservative activists who admire pence \u2014 that are each pushing their preferred candidates .     the transition team is also working to develop cohesive policies aimed at vetting nominees and protecting against conflicts of interest . trump \u2019 s transition website , greatagain.gov , says candidates for jobs in his administration will be subjected to a full fbi background check and must complete a \u201cpersonal data statement. \u201d     the statement includes questions about \u201cpossible conflicts of interest deriving from your sources of income ; all aspects of your personal and professional life , including organizations to which you belong or once belonged ; speeches you may have given and books , articles and editorials you may have written ; legal , administrative and regulatory proceedings to which you may have been a party , \u201d according to the website , which urges candidates to disclose \u201canything that might embarrass the president or you if he should choose you for a position in his administration. \u201d     if the transition team follows through on that plan , it would subject cabinet nominees and top white house staff to a greater level of scrutiny than trump himself received . he was the first presidential candidate in modern history to refuse to release his tax returns , leaving americans in the dark about his own possible conflicts on financial matters and dealing with foreign governments .     past transition teams have generally subjected cabinet nominees and other top administration officials to a rigorous in-house screening before announcing their nominations \u2014 and before nominees face questions from the white house office of government ethics , the office of personnel management and key senate committees .     obama infamously asked cabinet candidates to complete a seven-page form with 63 separate requests for information . a wikileaks email from nov. 2 , 2008 shows the extensive vetting of james steinberg , which involved a total of nine lawyers and a deep dive into his past . steinberg later served as deputy secretary of state .     so far , the trump transition team does not seem particularly concerned , for instance , about a transition team staffed heavily with lobbyists from energy , agriculture , transportation and banking .     \u201cfrankly , one of the refreshing parts of it about the whole trump style is that he does not care about political correctness . from a practical standpoint , i have heard lots of people say , \u2018why would we box ourselves out of the most knowledgeable policy people in the country? \u2019 \u201d said one source close to the transition team .     donald mcgahn ii , a partner at the firm jones day and trump \u2019 s lawyer , is expected to play a central role in vetting nominees . so is arthur culvahouse jr. , a partner at the firm o \u2019 melveny &amp; myers , who helped vet vice presidential candidates and , according to a source , has been helping the campaign organize its white house picks .     culvahouse declined a request for an interview . none of the lawyers in the political law practice at jones day returned politico \u2019 s calls . culvahouse has faced backlash from colleagues at his firm for working with trump , according to people familiar with the situation , with one person saying the decision was \u201camazingly controversial \u201d within the firm . many top partners at o \u2019 melveny , including tom donilon , were vocal backers of hillary clinton .\n"}, {"url": "file://train/52/0/3", "title": "train/52/0/3", "content": "washington \u2014 former new york mayor rudy giuliani is the leading

jong un is preparing for a high-stakes summit with u.s. president donald trump in singapore on june 12 , the first such meeting between a north korean leader and a sitting u.s. president .     the u.s. official , who spoke on sunday on condition of anonymity , was commenting on a report by south korea \u2019 s yonhap news agency that all three of the north \u2019 s top military officials were believed to have been replaced .     kim \u2019 s motivation remains unclear but analysts said the shake-up allows him and the ruling party to tighten control over the korean people \u2019 s army ( kpa ) at a critical time of international engagement and domestic development .     \u201cif kim jong un is set on making peace with the u.s. and south korea and dealing away at least part of the nuclear program , he will have to put the kpa \u2019 s influence in a box and keep it there , \u201d said ken gause , director of the international affairs group at cna , a non-profit research and analysis organization .     \u201cthis reshuffle has brought to the fore the officers who can do just that . they are loyal to kim jong un and no one else. \u201d     trump revived the singapore summit on friday after cancelling it a week earlier .     some dissent     the united states is seeking a negotiated end to north korea \u2019 s nuclear weapons program and u.s. officials believe there was some dissension in the military about kim \u2019 s approaches to south korea and the united states .     trump wants north korea to \u201cdenuclearize \u201d , or get rid of its nuclear arsenal , in return for relief from economic sanctions . north korea \u2019 s leadership is believed to regard nuclear weapons as crucial to its survival , while kim has said he plans to focus on economic development .     the u.s. official did not identify the three ousted military officials .     citing an unidentified intelligence official , yonhap said no kwang chol , first vice minister of the ministry of people \u2019 s armed forces , had replaced pak yong sik as defense chief , while ri myong su was replaced by his deputy , ri yong gil .     north korean state media previously confirmed that army general kim su gil had replaced kim jong gak as director of the kpa \u2019 s general political bureau .     the white house , state department , cia and office of the director of national intelligence did not respond immediately to requests for official comment .     south korea \u2019 s unification and defense ministries declined to confirm the report , while an official at

of state mike pompeo on monday to discuss the upcoming summit between kim and trump , the foreign ministry in seoul said .     economic factors , party control     given the military \u2019 s secondary role in the north \u2019 s nuclear and missile programs , the moves are likely more about installing a younger , even more trusted cohort of officials who kim jong un can rely on as he

the moves are likely linked in part to kim jong un \u2019 s drive to have the military take a bigger role in critical infrastructure projects . that could explain why newly appointed director of the kpa \u2019 s general political bureau , army general kim su gil , accompanied kim jong un on a field guidance trip to a beach tourist zone with other officials , madden said .     kim jong un is also likely expecting to receive more international economic aid and investment soon as part of the ongoing talks and he wants to prevent corruption that plagued some past projects , madden said .     all

( ap ) \u2014 democrats embraced diversity tuesday in a primary night of firsts , while republicans in minnesota rejected a familiar face of the gop old guard in favor of a rising newcomer aligned with president donald trump .     in vermont , democrats rallied behind the nation ' s first transgender nominee for governor . minnesota democrats backed a woman who would be the first somali-american member of congress . and in connecticut , the party nominated a candidate who could become the first black woman from the state to serve in congress .     still , democrats in minnesota also backed a national party leader who is facing accusations of domestic violence . he has denied the allegations , yet they threaten to undercut enthusiasm in his state and beyond .     on the other side , trump tightened his grip on the modern-day republican party as the turbulent 2018 primary season lurched toward its finale . a one-time trump critic , former two-term minnesota gov . tim pawlenty , lost a comeback attempt he was expected to win .     all but 10 states picked their candidates for november ' s general election by the time the day ' s final votes were counted . while the full political battlefield isn ' t quite set , the stakes are clear : democrats are working to topple republican control of congress and governors ' offices across the nation .     four states held primaries tuesday : vermont , connecticut , minnesota and wisconsin . kansas ' gubernatorial primary , which was held last week , was finalized when republican gov . jeff colyer conceded defeat .     in minnesota , republican county commissioner jeff johnson defeated pawlenty , who once called trump \" unhinged and unfit \" and was hoping to regain his old post . in wisconsin , gov . scott walker , endorsed just this week by trump , won the right to seek a third term .     the president ' s pick for kansas governor , secretary of state kris kobach , scored a delayed victory against colyer , who became the first incumbent governor to fall this season .     in vermont , democrat christine hallquist won the democratic nomination in her quest to become the nation ' s first transgender governor . the former chief executive of vermont electric cooperative bested a field of four democrats that included a 14-year-old .     while she made history on tuesday , hallquist faces a difficult path to the governor ' s mansion . republican incumbent phil scott remains more popular with democrats than members of his own party in the solidly liberal state .     vermont democrats also nominated sen. bernie sanders , who hasn ' t ruled out a second presidential run in 2020 , for a third term in the senate . the 76-year-old democratic socialist won the democratic nomination , but he is expected to turn it down and run as an independent .     democrats appeared particularly motivated in wisconsin , where eight candidates lined up for the chance to take on walker .     walker ' s strong anti-union policies made him a villain to democrats long before trump ' s rise . state schools chief tony evers , who has clashed with walker at times , won the democratic nomination and will take on walker this fall .     once a target of trump criticism , walker gained the president ' s endorsement in a tweet monday night calling him \" a tremendous governor who has done incredible things for that great state . \"     trump also starred , informally at least , in wisconsin ' s senate primaries as republicans try to deny democratic sen. tammy baldwin a second term .     longtime state lawmaker leah vukmir , who was backed by house speaker paul ryan , won the republican primary , even after struggling to explain footage recently unearthed from 2016 in which she called trump \" offensive to everyone . \"     tuesday ' s primaries served as a test of democratic enthusiasm in the upper midwest , a region that has long been associated with liberal politics but has been trending red . trump won wisconsin by less than 1 percentage point in 2016 , becoming the first republican presidential candidate to carry the state since 1984.     it was much the same in minnesota , where trump lost by less than 3 percentage points in a state that hasn ' t backed a republican presidential contender since 1972.     nearly twice as many minnesota democrats as republicans cast ballots in their parties ' respective gubernatorial primaries .     pawlenty had been considered the heavy favorite in a two-person republican contest for his old job . but he struggled to adapt to a gop that had changed drastically since he left office in 2011 and flamed out early in a 2012 presidential bid .     the former two-term governor strained to live down his october 2016 comment that trump was \" unhinged and unfit for the presidency , \" remarks that incensed many republican voters in minnesota and beyond . johnson , his underfunded opponent , circulated pawlenty ' s critique far and wide , telling voters that he was a steadfast supporter of the president .     johnson will face democratic rep. tim walz , who won a three-way race for his party ' s nomination .     three minnesota women won senate nominations , including incumbent democrats amy klobuchar and tina smith .     smith , who had been appointed to replace disgraced democrat al franken , will face republican state sen. karin housley , ensuring a woman will hold the seat once held by franken , who left congress amid allegations of sexual misconduct toward women .     nationwide , a record number of women are running this year for governor and congress .     meanwhile , a new scandal threatened to dampen democratic enthusiasm .     rep. keith ellison , the democratic national committee ' s deputy chairman , captured his party ' s nomination in the race to become the state ' s attorney general . that ' s after ellison ' s candidacy was rocked by allegations over the weekend of domestic violence amid a broader national outcry against sexual misconduct by powerful men in business , entertainment and politics .     ellison has denied a former girlfriend ' s allegations that he dragged her off a bed while screaming obscenities during a 2016 relationship she said was plagued by \" narcissistic abuse . \"     also in minnesota , democrat ilhan omar , the nation ' s first somali-american legislator , won her party ' s congressional primary in the race to replace ellison .     in connecticut , republican businessman bob stefanowski emerged from a field of five republicans seeking to replace the unpopular outgoing governor , democrat dan malloy . former gubernatorial candidate ned lamont won the democratic nomination .     connecticut democrats picked a former teacher of the year , jahana hayes , to run for the seat vacated by rep. elizabeth etsy , who is leaving congress after bungling sexual abuse claims levied against a former staffer . hayes could become the first black woman from the state to serve in congress .     ___     peoples reported from washington . associated press writer scott bauer in madison , wisconsin contributed to this
