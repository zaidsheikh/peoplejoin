delaying takeoff in order to allow them to make the funeral of a beloved family member .     the family ran into a problem familiar to many travelers -- a flight delay -- on their way to tennessee . the family was headed to the funeral of jay w. short , a 56-year-old husband and father of three who died on dec. 16 after losing a battle to lung cancer about five months after being diagnosed .     a 90-minute delay in the family \u2019 s flight from phoenix \u2019 s sky harbor airport left them with about 7 minutes to make a connecting flight in minneapolis , which was the last plane flying to memphis that day . the funeral was scheduled for the following morning .     \" this was our last chance to say goodbye to my dad and if we missed the flight we would [ have ] missed the funeral , \" nicole short-wibel , jay \u2019 s daughter , told abc news .     by the time the family dashed to the gate in the minneapolis airport , the door to the jet way was closed and the tennessee-bound plane was taxiing toward the runway . it was then that airport workers delivered the news to the family -- it was too late to make it on board .     \" my son and i are waving our arms at the pilots and the ground crew as my two daughters are crying their eyes out . we are pleading for them to not take off , \" marcia short , jay \u2019 s wife , wrote in a post that was displayed on her daughter \u2019 s facebook page . \" if we did not get on that flight we would miss the funeral . we had to get to memphis . \"     the pilot , capt . adam cohen , saw the desperation on their faces through the airport windows . that \u2019 s when he made an unprecedented move -- turning the plane back to ensure the family made it on board .     cohen flies for endeavor air , a regional airline carrier owned by delta air lines .     marcia short said on facebook that cohen and his first officer \" blessed my family and gave us a gift that no one else could . thank you from the bottom of our hearts . \"     \" it meant the world , \" short-wibel said .     cohen \u2019 s decision and the attention it has received has not gone unnoticed by his employer .     \" this endeavor air pilot \u2019 s decision to return to the gate in this special circumstance is a great reflection of the human touch we want all delta customers to experience when flying with us , \" a delta spokesperson said in a statement .     cohen said that helping the family had a big impact on him and the crew .     \" this is something we \u2019 ll take with us , knowing we made a difference , \" cohen said . \" little moments like this to us are big to these customers and keep them coming back to delta , but at the end of the day , it also keeps us going . \"     while delta praised cohen ' s decision , airline analysts said it ' s one that could have gotten him in trouble with his employer if it had worked out differently .     in order for the pilot to hold the flight , he had to risk \" the censure of his company , \" abc news aviation analyst john nance said .     \" the door is always closed on time because the most important thing to airlines is on time departure records , \" said nance .\n"}, {"url": "file://test/40/1/0", "title": "test/40/1/0", "content": "new york ( reuters ) - former berkshire hathaway executive david sokol deliberately misled warren buffett when pitching an investment to him , the company ' s board concluded in a scathing report that may add fuel to a pending sec probe of buffett ' s one-time heir apparent .     the board said it may sue sokol to recover the $ 3 million of trading profit he made when berkshire bought chemicals company lubrizol corp and could seek damages from him for harm to the company ' s reputation . the company will cooperate with any government probe in the matter as well .     the u.s. securities and exchange commission is probing sokol , a person familiar with the matter said on wednesday .     sokol ' s high-profile attorney disputed the board ' s report and said his client is \" a man of uncommon rectitude and probity . \"     \" i have known mr. sokol and have represented his companies in business litigation since the mid 1980s , \" said barry levine of the washington firm dickstein shapiro . \" he would not , and did not , trade improperly , nor did he violate any fair reading of the berkshire hathaway policies . \"     levine said in a statement late on wednesday that sokol had been studying lubrizol for personal investment since the summer of 2010 and such investments are specifically allowed by his employment agreement .     \" buffett was told twice , not once , about sokol ' s ownership of lubrizol stock before buffett engaged in any discussions with lubrizol , \" levine said .     levine , who has done work for sokol ' s former company midamerican energy , co-heads dickstein ' s white collar criminal defense practice and has also represented attempted ronald reagan assassin john hinckley .     the report is an unusual statement from a board that has historically been very close to buffett , who is ceo and chairman . it may begin to answer the demands of shareholders who expected buffett to address the controversy at the company ' s annual meeting in omaha , nebraska this weekend .     buffett previously said he would have nothing further to say about sokol ' s actions , a stance that became untenable over time given the intense pressure on the conglomerate .     the report paints a picture of buffett as having been duped by sokol . however , one shareholder said it was also crafted to exonerate buffett from wrongdoing .     \" this report makes it clearly look like this was not warren buffett ' s fault , this was sokol ' s fault , \" said michael yoshikami , chief executive of wealth manager ycmnet advisors and a berkshire shareholder . \" there really is an effort here to make clear that this was not warren buffett ' s behavior in any way , this was sokol ' s behavior . \"     gain at risk     buffett announced sokol ' s resignation in march , noting that sokol bought shares in lubrizol before suggesting to buffett that berkshire buy the company . while sokol mentioned to buffett in \" passing \" that he held some lubrizol stock , buffett said he only later found out that sokol held nearly 100,000 lubrizol shares worth about $ 10 million .     sokol made a profit of about $ 3 million -- a gain that could be at risk . the berkshire board said it was still considering legal action against sokol to , among other things , recover any trading profits he made .     \" it hardly sounds like berkshire is trying to circle the wagons to protect sokol , \" said francis pileggi , a partner at fox rothschild lp in wilmington , delaware . \" if i had my druthers , i would rather be representing berkshire in this matter than sokol in a delaware court . \"     besides the potential civil recovery , berkshire ' s board also said it would cooperate with any government investigation . a spokesman for the securities and exchange commission declined to comment .     legal experts said sokol appears to be in more trouble now than was first thought .     \" i think mr. sokol has a real problem here , \" said duke university law professor james cox . \" this is not a close call at all . \"     fallen heir     sokol , who used to run berkshire subsidiaries midamerican and netjets , was widely seen as buffett ' s heir apparent , an image buffett biographers say the \" oracle of omaha \" cultivated .     yet sokol , in his one public appearance since the scandal broke , told cnbc he had no aspiration to the job . in wednesday ' s statement , berkshire said sokol reiterated as much to buffett before buffett announced sokol ' s resignation .     when buffett made that announcement , he said he believed sokol had not done anything unlawful . the statement wednesday seemed to suggest otherwise .     \" his misleadingly incomplete disclosures to berkshire hathaway senior management concerning those purchases violated the duty of candor he owed to the company , \" the board said -- noting that an executive ' s duty of candor was part of the duty of loyalty under delaware law where berkshire is incorporated .     berkshire ' s board also said certain answers sokol gave to buffett in response to questions about the nature of his holdings appeared \" intended to deceive . \"     in total , the 18-page statement uses variations on the word \" violation \" some 11 times .     the board ' s audit committee held three meetings this month to consider the report .     berkshire attorney ron olson said sokol was interviewed at least three times regarding his lubrizol trading and contacts with citigroup inc bankers . \" in connection with the preparation of the audit committee report , a request for a further interview with mr. sokol was made to his attorney . mr. sokol was not made available , \" olson said in the statement .     the audit committee members are chairman thomas murphy , 85 , and a decades-long buffett friend ; donald keough , 84 , a former president of key buffett holding coca cola co ; and former microsoft executive charlotte guyman , 54.     their report is likely to take some pressure off buffett this weekend when tens of thousands of shareholders descend on omaha for berkshire ' s annual festival-cum-general-meeting .     \" one way or another , mr. buffett will have to address this . it ' s conceivable that this release relieves mr. buffett from the chore of addressing what is an unpleasant issue , \" said jerry bruni , ceo and portfolio manager at j.v . bruni and co , which owns berkshire shares and has $ 450 million of assets under management .     berkshire ' s actively traded class b shares were flat at $ 82.99 in after-hours trading .
