requires radical change to its business model if is to remain viable in the future. \u201d     mr. berry said the obama administration would push for legislation to allow a three-month delay in the $ 5.5 billion payment . but he stopped short of endorsing a far-reaching proposal , backed by the postal service , to allow the agency to claw back more than $ 50 billion that two independent actuaries have said the post office has overpaid into a major federal pension plan . postal service officials say such a move would go far to alleviate the agency \u2019 s financial problems .     mr. berry said the administration was studying the proposal , but not endorsing or opposing it at this point .     he said the administration would release a more comprehensive proposal in coming weeks \u201cto ensure a sustainable future for the postal service , \u201d one that would be part of the broader $ 1.5 trillion deficit reduction package that the president obama has promised to send to congress .     the post office \u2019 s financial problems are complex . mail volume has been steadily declining , and the agency has been unable to cut its labor costs or reduce services quickly enough to match the fall in revenue . at the same time , the post office faces legal constraints that prevent it from diversifying into new lines of business , and it is also barred from raising postage prices faster than the rate of inflation .     photo     mr. berry noted that the obama administration did support the postal service \u2019 s push to recover $ 7 billion that officials agree was overpaid into yet another pension fund . but he expressed serious reservations about the postal service \u2019 s plan to cut costs by moving postal workers into a new , supposedly cheaper health insurance plan .     the two senators most active on postal issues \u2014 thomas carper , a delaware democrat who is chairman of the subcommittee overseeing the post office , and susan collins of maine , who is the ranking republican on the governmental affairs committee \u2014 criticized the obama administration for not acting more quickly and decisively to address the post office \u2019 s problems .

administration doesn \u2019 t have a plan to put before us today , given the dire straits that we \u2019 re in. \u201d     several senators from rural states attacked the postal service \u2019 s proposals to close many post offices and to end saturday delivery , saying it would hurt rural americans disproportionately and would hurt those who rely on mail delivery of prescriptions and newspapers .     postal officials say a major reason for the postal service \u2019 s financial crisis \u2014 it has lost $ 20 billion over the last four years \u2014 is a 2006 law requiring the post office to pay an average of $ 5.5 billion a year for 10 years to underwrite 75 years of health coverage for future retirees . the post office hopes to use much of $ 50 billion in claimed pension overpayments to cover those annual health care payments .     cliff guffey , president of the american postal workers union , one of the four postal unions , denounced the post office \u2019 s proposal to lay off 120,000 workers . the agency has asked congress to pass a special law overturning no-layoff provisions in its union contracts . some of those contracts bar the layoff of any workers with more than six years on the job .     \u201cthese proposals are outrageous , illegal and despicable , \u201d mr. guffey said .     he said his union had agreed to $ 3.7 billion in savings in a contract signed in may to help the postal service cut costs . in return , the union preserved its longstanding job-protection provisions . \u201cto unilaterally abrogate what we gained is totally contrary to the duty to bargain collectively , \u201d he said .     an overarching trend that has fueled the postal service \u2019 s crisis \u2014 and reduced annual mail volume by 22 percent since 2006 \u2014 is that americans are e-mailing , paying bills electronically and reading shopping catalogs and news online .     noting that some great books have been written based on letters sent by the founding fathers and by soldiers , senator claire mccaskill , democrat of missouri , urged the postmaster general to run an advertising campaign urging americans to send more letters to each other .     \u201cthere is something special about receiving a piece of first-class mail , knowing that it comes from someone you care about , \u201d she said . \u201ci really believe that if someone would begin to market the value of sending a written letter to someone you love , you might be surprised what it will do for your christmas season. \u201d\n"}], "farshid": [{"url": "file://val/64/0/1",

official told lawmakers tuesday .     with the postal service speeding toward default , john berry , the director of the office of personnel management , also said the administration would like to delay the deadline usps faces for a massive benefits payment by 90 days .     advertisement     berry said the extra time would allow the white house , congress and postal service to find a path forward for the agency .     \u201cboth the president and i know of the critical importance to our nation \u2019 s economy that the postal service provides , \u201d berry said at a hearing of the senate homeland security and government affairs committee .     postmaster general patrick donahoe said at the same hearing that pushing the $ 5.5 billion payment for future retiree healthcare costs back to the end of the year would give usps some financial breathing room .     but he also reiterated that the service would default on the payment regardless of the deadline \u2014 and that , with technological advancements continuing to eat into its bottom line , usps needed to radically restructure its business model , with some help from congress .     if changes are not made , donahoe told reporters , \u201cwe think that around the august , september time frame next year we would be out of cash. \u201d     the postal service is fast approaching its borrowing limit of $ 15 billion , leaving officials concerned about a first-ever usps default . donahoe told the senate panel that the postal service \u2019 s net loss for this fiscal year could run as high as $ 10 billion , and projects to around $ 9 billion for next year .     usps , which does not use taxpayer revenue for operations , also expects to handle 167 billion pieces of mail this year , 22 percent less than it did in 2006. officials say the economic struggles of the last five years are at least partly to blame for that decline , but admit that the increasing ability to communicate and pay bills online is a major factor as well .     lawmakers at tuesday \u2019 s hearing appeared to see a usps overhaul as a potential area for bipartisanship in the aftermath of the polarizing debt-ceiling debate .     \u201care we going to fight about the post office , too ? \u201d sen. scott brown ( r-mass. ) asked .     sen. joe lieberman ( i-conn. ) , the chairman of the homeland security panel , said during the hearing that lawmakers would not be able to act as quickly as donahoe had wanted . the postmaster general had asked for congressional action by the end of september .     but lieberman added that he

at a bare minimum , he would like for congress to give usps the authority to scrap saturday delivery and give the service access to what it says is a nearly $ 7 billion overpayment into a federal retirement program .     the postmaster general also wants lawmakers to allow the service to either look into overseeing its own healthcare benefits or give it access to what usps says is an even larger overpayment .     usps has indicated that it wants the authority to lay off tens of thousands of workers over the next three years , despite labor contracts that contain no layoff provisions , and announced that it is looking into closing thousands of local branches .     unions and democratic lawmakers like reps. elijah cummings ( md. ) and stephen lynch ( mass. ) are pushing back against the labor proposal , with contracts covering roughly 45 percent of the service \u2019 s 560,000 career employees expiring in november .     rural-state lawmakers have expressed concern about allowing usps to move to five-day delivery and to shutter offices .     still , senators at tuesday \u2019 s hearing at least appeared open to giving usps a broad makeover . sen. tom coburn thomas ( tom )

for answers about why the administration is waiting to offer its usps plan , given the service \u2019 s financial straits . the white house is expected to deliver its deficit-reduction plan , which could exceed the $ 1.5 trillion mandate given to the new congressional supercommittee , in the coming weeks .     on tuesday , berry said the administration agreed that usps deserved access to the $ 6.9 billion surplus it paid into the federal employees retirement system . but he also drew collins \u2019 s ire after noting that the white house did not have a formal opinion on other potential fixes .     \u201ci just don \u2019 t understand why the administration doesn \u2019 t have a concrete plan to put before us today , given the dire straits that we \u2019 re in , \u201d the maine

service by the end of september .     \u201cwe appreciate all the attention , and want to work together with both parties to get this rolling , \u201d he said .\n"}, {"url": "file://val/64/2/1", "title": "val/64/2/1", "content": "the day started with a possible answer to one of the digital era ' s greatest mysteries : who created the bitcoin virtual currency that has become a multibillion-dollar global phenomenon ?     from there , with the unlikely revelation by newsweek magazine that it might be dorian satoshi nakamoto , a 64-year-old japanese american living in temple city , the day only got wilder and weirder .     it featured a media frenzy on his front lawn and a semi-comical car chase through multiple cities as nakamoto rode in a prius driven by an associated press reporter trying to elude other reporters . and then , a denial from nakamoto \u2014 as he climbed into an elevator at the downtown ap offices \u2014 that he was the creator of bitcoin .     \" i never was involved , \" he said to a times reporter , saying there was only one reason he had agreed to even talk to a reporter . \" it was all for a free lunch . \"     really ?     like so many other elements of the day , the off-the-cuff remarks hinted at some finality but in truth only contributed to the murkiness surrounding the true identity of \" satoshi nakamoto , \" the mastermind behind bitcoin . indeed , the story published by newsweek on thursday sparked an angry backlash among members of the bitcoin community , with some vowing retribution against the reporter and others insisting that she had the wrong man .     \" he always used non-tracking emails and did everything he could to stay anonymous , so it ' s difficult for me to understand why he would use his real name , \" said adam draper , who runs a start-up that invests in bitcoin-related companies .     in a 2008 memo titled \" bitcoin : a peer-to-peer electronic cash system , \" \" satoshi nakamoto \" laid out the details for a new virtual currency . rather than relying on banks and other financial middlemen , bitcoins would rely on a cryptographic protocol to ensure its value , security and anonymity .     users would have to \" mine \" coins by solving complex mathematical problems . they could then buy and sell them through various exchanges . initially , it was embraced by hackers and anarchists who loved the idea of a currency free from government or corporate control .     but over time , bitcoins created a frenzy as their value skyrocketed , making many of the original bitcoin members quite wealthy .     they also moved closer to mainstream acceptance as a growing number of businesses began accepting them and entrepreneurs and venture capitalists created an expanding economy of bitcoin-related companies .     bitcoins have also generated controversy , with u.s. agencies breaking up a notorious online black market in which users used the currency to buy drugs and guns . last month , one of the largest and oldest bitcoin exchanges announced that hackers had stolen more than $ 450 million worth of bitcoins , forcing it to file for bankruptcy .     along the way , nakamoto never stepped forward to claim credit . and , in fact , a couple years ago , he withdrew from the bitcoin community completely , leaving others to carry on the work of developing the system and wonder about his real identity , which remained shrouded in mystery .     until thursday .     following a trail of clues over several months , newsweek reporter leah mcgrath goodman believed she had tracked down the real bitcoin creator . the article said satoshi nakamoto was not a fake name , as many had assumed , but his real one \u2014 just one of many strange twists .     in part , she said she found him by discovering he had a hobby of collecting model trains ,     fred hill , the owner of original whistle-stop trains in pasadena , said in an interview with the times on thursday that nakamoto has been a regular since hill bought the business in 1976.     nakamoto , a skilled machinist who builds all of his train layouts from scratch , is highly sociable and \" a lot of fun , \" hill said . nakamoto will chat extensively about trains , particularly steam engines . in the shop , he always goes by his adopted first name , dorian .     \" he ' s not a disheveled , spacey individual at all , \" hill said . \" he ' s not an eccentric . he ' s a very intelligent man . \"     the newsweek story also said he had a career in technology that included some classified work for major corporations and u.s. defense agencies . he has been separated from his wife for more than a decade . and much of what he did for a living over the past decade was unclear . nakamoto ' s modest home surprised the
