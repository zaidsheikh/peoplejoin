will join other schools in southwestern ontario who have decided to cancel trips to the u.s. , citing concerns over muddled u.s. border restrictions .     john malloy , the tdsb director of education , said that 24 trips to the u.s. already approved by the board will proceed for now , but that no new trips will be arranged .     the pre-approved trips involve approximately 800 students , as well as 100 students headed to the deca competition .     \u201cwhile already-approved trips are proceeding at this time , it \u2019 s important to note that should the executive order be fully implemented , resulting in any of our students being excluded from trips across the u.s. border , then the board has asked me to cancel already-approved trips to the u.s. for the remainder of the school year , \u201d he said in a statement published to the tdsb website thursday .     malloy said the board is prepared to reimburse students , parents and staff of the trip costs should this occur .     \u201cwe do not make this decision lightly , \u201d he said , \u201cbut given the uncertainty of these new travel restrictions and when they may come into effect , if at all , we strongly believe that our students should not be placed into these situations of potentially being turned away at the border. \u201d     though an executive order was handed down by u.s. president donald trump earlier this month , banning travel from citizens of six muslim-majority countries , it is currently not in effect .     federal court judges in hawaii and maryland blocked the order ahead of it being put in place , calling it a violation of the u.s. constitution .     while the order does not affect permanent residents or citizens of canada , malloy said the board does not want to risk having any one of their students turned away at the border .     tdsb spokesperson ryan bird said thursday that the board decided to allow the prearranged trips to go forward because they haven \u2019 t encountered an issue at the border with their students in the past .     \u201cright now we \u2019 re staying no new u.s. trips . having said that , if we get clarification or if we get more information that maybe changes that , obviously we \u2019 ll revisit these decisions , \u201d he told cp24 .     bird said that if a student does encounter an issue at the border on a pre-approved trip , the whole group will turn around .     \u201cit \u2019 s not about politics , it \u2019 s about our principles as a school board to be inclusive and equitable . it \u2019 s not who \u2019 s in change , it \u2019 s not where they \u2019 re going , \u201d bird said .     \u201cif our students can \u2019 t go somewhere for no legitimate reason , they \u2019 re being excluded from these trips . we don \u2019 t want them in those situations so that \u2019 s why we \u2019 re taking these additional steps. \u201d     the greater essex county district school board made a similar decision in february , though it was only in effect for that month .     ryerson university also suspended trips to the u.s. earlier this month , citing similar concerns about border restrictions .     more recently , the girl guides of canada

balance between ensuring safety and inclusion for students , without causing financial loss and disappointment by cancelling the spring trips kids had planned and fundraised for over many months .

entry to the u.s. if trump \u2019 s proposed travel restrictions are put in place . she and many of her friends whose families immigrated from the six countries affected are nervous about what will happen when the bus stops at the border , even though they have canadian passports , she says . but hearing that the school board has a plan in place helps , she added . the plan means there will be no trips to the u.s. approved for the 2017-2018 school year . but still on track are 24 separate trips involving about 800 students , and plans for about 100 youth from different schools to attend an international business competition in california .     in the event that any student or staff member on a trip this spring is refused entry at the border as a result of u.s. travel policy , everyone on the trip would return home and malloy would be permitted to cancel remaining trips for this year , according to the motion approved by trustees . he could also cancel trips if travel restrictions

time if travel advisories change , \u201d said carla pereira , spokesperson for the peel district school board . the toronto catholic district school board has not suspended trips to the u.s. or abroad , however \u201cwe continue to monitor the situation , \u201d said spokesperson john yan . malloy had originally been scheduled to provide tdsb trustees with an update wednesday on a situation
