havill cuddle their two-month-old son sebastian , it ' s hard to believe their little guy has been through more major medical procedures in his short life -- and even before being born -- than many people experience in a lifetime .     weeks before his birth in may , toronto doctors discovered through imaging scans that sebastian had not one , but two congenital heart defects -- and they knew they had to do something fairly radical to bring him into the world and give him a chance at a full and healthy life .     that something was an in-utero procedure to poke a hole in the wall between the upper chambers of his tiny heart , which had developed with no opening , followed by an operation after birth to repair his major cardiac arteries , which weren ' t in the proper locations .     scans of sebastian while in his mother ' s womb showed his aorta , the vessel that takes oxygen-rich blood to the brain and body , and his pulmonary artery , which channels blood to the lungs to be oxygenated , were switched -- a condition known as transposition of the great arteries , or tga .     doctors also discovered there were no openings in the walls between either the two upper chambers ( the atria ) of his heart or the bottom two chambers ( the ventricles ) , which would have prevented his blood from circulating properly after birth . while in the womb , fetal blood is oxygenated through the placenta .     \" if a baby doesn ' t have any holes between the two sides , so the right and left half , the child would be deeply blue , and eventually will die from this condition unless we are able to create the hole after birth rapidly , \" said cardiologist dr. edgar jaeggi , head of the fetal cardiac program at sick kids hospital and part of the two-hospital team that cared for barry and her soon-to-be born baby .     \" this is a life-threatening condition that could result in rapid brain damage , with the baby doing very poorly and dying from this , \" jaeggi explained .     however , after sebastian ' s birth , doctors would have had only a few minutes to open up his chest and repair his heart , requiring full neonatal resuscitation and cardiac surgery teams to be on stand-by .     to avoid such a high-risk delivery and the dangers to the newborn , a team of doctors from mount sinai hospital and sick kids opted to perform the procedure to create an opening between the upper chambers of sebastian ' s heart while he was in the womb .     \" it ' s pretty intense hearing something like that , that they ' re going to do it while he ' s still inside of her , \" havill , 27 , said tuesday after he and his wife travelled to sick kids from their home in barrie , ont. , north of toronto .     \" it ' s something you would think would only happen on a tv medical show , not in real life , \" agreed barry , 25 . \" doing the in-utero procedure actually sounded like the best possible thing . in my gut , we knew this was what we wanted to happen , what we needed to do . \"     on may 18 , doctors at mount sinai took the first steps , injecting drugs through barry ' s abdomen that put sebastian to sleep , paralyzed his body to prevent him from moving , and provided pain relief .     \" the baby obviously has to be in the right position , \" said dr. greg ryan , head of the fetal medicine program at mount sinai .     \" because if the baby is not aligned in-utero , it ' s a non-starter , and we ' ve sometimes had to wait for two or three days for the baby to come into position where it gives us our best shot -- because you have one shot and you need to make that work . \"     barry was then transported to sick kids across the street via an underground tunnel that connects the two hospitals , where ryan performed the next part of the procedure under ultrasound-guided imagery , inserting a fine needle through barry ' s abdomen and uterus , then into the upper chamber of sebastian ' s heart and passing it through the wall to the adjacent atrium .     a catheter was then fed through the needle and a tiny balloon inserted between the wall , a process that ' s similar to balloon angioplasty to open up a blocked coronary artery in those at risk of a heart attack .     \" then , essentially , we blow up the balloon in that wall which had been closed , \" explained ryan . \" by blowing it up , we could open up a hole in the wall between the two chambers , and this allows the mixing of the blood .     \" once we ' ve done that , we withdraw the needle and withdraw the catheter out of the baby ' s heart , \" he said , adding that he believes this is the first time in the world that the in-utero procedure has been performed in a fetus with tga .     jaeggi said the team waited until sebastian was almost full-term to do the in-utero surgery -- called a balloon atrial septoplasty , or bas -- because doing so earlier might have allowed the hole to close up again .     \" we wanted the biggest hole closest to delivery , \" he said , describing the opening as about 3.5 millimetres in diameter .     on may 23 , barry gave birth through a regular vaginal delivery after being induced and sebastian was born \" pink and screaming . \"     \" they always primed us that we would be having a blue baby , so when he came out , i ' m like ' that ' s not blue , \" ' said barry , recalling her huge sense of relief . \" he was here and he looked as babies should when they ' re born . \"     sebastian had a second bas procedure after birth to ensure the atrial opening was large enough . then five days later , surgeons at sick kids performed open-heart surgery on the infant to switch his aorta and pulmonary artery into their proper positions .     now weighing 10 pounds and meeting all his developmental milestones , sebastian is like any other healthy two-month-old , his parents say .     \" he ' s a pretty calm , pretty chill baby . he lets us know when he ' s not happy . he still has that very strong set of lungs that he was born with , \" barry said . \" we just recently started getting our smiles from him . \"     \" you barely even know that anything had happened to him unless you take off his shirt and see his scars , \" added havill . \" he ' s just awesome . \"     the couple say it ' s hard to express how grateful they are to the medical teams at the two hospitals .     \" thank you doesn ' t seem like enough , but definitely thanks to them for saving my baby ' s life , \" barry said .     \" it ' s just amazing what they ' re able and capable of doing . \"\n"}], "eden":

his heart , known as a balloon atrial septoplasty , five days earlier \u2014 while he was still in his mother ' s womb .     during barry ' s prenatal checkups , sebastian was diagnosed with a severe congenital heart defect , in which the two main arteries of the heart are reversed . his case was especially complex because the interior walls of his heart were sealed shut , so that blood couldn ' t flow between the chambers to pick up oxygen .     \" we had a baby with the two sides of the circulation that were not communicating . there was no opening between the upper chambers and the lower chambers and the vessels were coming off the wrong side , \" says dr. greg ryan , head of the fetal medicine program at mount sinai hospital .     \" so what we had to do was to create a communication to allow the blood to mix . \"     ' the clock ticks '     in most cases , newborn babies with heart defects can be rushed from the neonatal unit at mount sinai hospital to the hospital for sick children ( sickkids ) across the street , says dr. rajiv chaturvedi , a cardiologist at sickkids .     but the closed walls of sebastian ' s heart made it unable to automatically circulate oxygen once he lost access to the oxygen supplied via the placenta . that meant there would be little time to save sebastian from severe complications after he left his mother ' s womb .     \" the clock ticks [ so ] that you have a few minutes and you start having brain damage and other organ damage , \" says dr. edgar jaeggi , head of the fetal cardiac program at sickkids .     christopher havill and kristine barry are enjoying a normal life at home with their newborn son , sebastian , thanks to his heart surgeries \u2014 one of which was performed while he was still in his mother ' s womb . ( cbc news )     so on may 18 , ryan , chaturvedi and jaeggi , along with dozens of clinicians from both mount sinai hospital and sickkids performed a risky and remarkable procedure : a balloon atrial septoplasty while the baby is still in the uterus .     with neonatal and cardiac surgeons on standby in case an emergency cesarean section became necessary , the doctors used a needle to insert a balloon through barry ' s uterus and into sebastian ' s heart , making a small hole to open up the heart ' s interior wall , so oxygenated blood could pass through .     although the procedure was a success , it wasn ' t a cure for sebastian ' s original heart defect , and he would still require open-heart surgery after birth . but it meant that barry could deliver him normally , without the trauma of knowing it would be a frantic race against time to whisk her baby away and supply him with oxygen .     a healthy start     in fact , sebastian ' s father , christopher havill , had time to cut the umbilical cord \u2014 and he remembers the team even told them they could take pictures .     surgeons repeated the same procedure they had done in-utero on sebastian that day to further ensure the flow of oxygen . a week later , he had open-heart surgery to fix his reversed arteries . two months later , he ' s a normal baby at home in barrie , ont. , fussing on his mother ' s lap as his dad smiles and soothes him .     \" he ' s such a good little cuddle buddy , \" havill says .     the doctors have even told the couple that sebastian ' s scar from his open heart surgery will eventually fade , and will be barely visible by adulthood .     \" these kids can play soccer , play hockey , go to university , have pretty normal lives , \" chaturvedi says .\n"}, {"url": "file://test/46/2/1", "title": "test/46/2/1", "content": "file - this oct. 26 , 2015 , file photo shows baltimore ravens cornerback tray walker ( 25 ) during the second half of an nfl football game in glendale , ariz. walker is in critical condition after being involved ...
