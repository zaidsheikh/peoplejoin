along the iraqi-syrian border to deprive isis of the safe havens it enjoys in that area .     advertisement continue reading the main story     \u201cthe iraqis have asked for assistance in the border regions , and that \u2019 s something we \u2019 re looking at , \u201d one state department official said .     the description of a calibrated military buildup by coalition forces , combined with a steady effort led by the united states treasury department to choke off isis \u2019 ability to reap $ 1 million or more a day from oil sales , emerged as the administration has tried to define what mr. obama meant when he said the american goal was to \u201cdegrade and ultimately destroy \u201d the sunni extremist group .     the president \u2019 s chief of staff , denis mcdonough , provided the most current definition of white house thinking on sunday during an interview on nbc \u2019 s \u201cmeet the press. \u201d using an alternative acronym for the extremist group , he said that \u201csuccess looks like an isil that no longer threatens our friends in the region , no longer threatens the united states , an isil that can \u2019 t accumulate followers or threaten muslims in syria , iraq or otherwise. \u201d     advertisement continue reading the main story     that definition falls short of the classic understanding of what it means to destroy an opposing force . but the administration is betting that it has tailored the goals to appeal to the coalition of oftentimes reluctant partners it is trying to assemble , many of whom are deeply suspicious of each other .     secretary of state john kerry , speaking from paris , declined to say which states had offered to contribute air power , an announcement that white house officials said could await his return to testify in congress early this week . state department officials , who asked not to be identified under the agency \u2019 s protocol for briefing reporters , said arab nations could participate in an air campaign against isis in other ways without dropping bombs , such as by flying arms to iraqi or kurdish forces , conducting reconnaissance flights or providing logistical support and refueling .     advertisement continue reading the main story     \u201ci don \u2019 t want to leave you with the impression that these arab members haven \u2019 t offered to do airstrikes , because several of them have , \u201d one state department official said . \u201cthe iraqis would have to be a major participant in that decision , \u201d the official added . \u201cit has to be well structured and organized. \u201d     the united arab emirates , which provided some air power in the 2011 attacks on libya , seemed at the top of the list , with qatar hosting an american military headquarters . american officials cautioned that all strikes would have to be approved by the newly assembled government in iraq , as well as by american military planners . that could prove just one challenge to the offer by arab nations to participate in airstrikes : while iraq \u2019 s struggling military forces have experience operating with the united states , its shiite-dominated government has never worked with the sunni states of the persian gulf .     please verify you ' re not a robot by clicking the box . invalid email address . please re-enter . you must select a newsletter to subscribe to .

contributions : warplanes , support aircraft that can refuel or provide intelligence , more basing agreements to carry out strikes , and the insertion of trainers from other western countries .     advertisement continue reading the main story     tellingly , there are no plans , as of now , to increase the number of american attack planes in the region . the aircraft carrier carl vinson is scheduled to relieve the carrier george h. w. bush in the persian gulf next month ; if the pentagon changed its plans and kept two carriers in the gulf , it could double carrier-based firepower over iraq and syria . but for now , there is no plan to do so , officials said . nor are there any plans to increase american ground-based strike aircraft at facilities around the region , in hopes that persian gulf and european allies would make up the difference .     advertisement continue reading the main story     another striking feature of the american plan , officials said , was the deliberate exclusion of coordination with two other players with an interest \u2014 and some ability \u2014 to take on isis : the government of iran and the forces of president bashar al-assad of syria , who mr. obama declared three years ago was a brutal dictator who had to leave office .     advertisement continue reading the main story     mr. kerry has ruled out cooperative efforts with iranian officials , who a senior administration official said last week are \u201clooking for whatever leverage they can get \u201d in the conflict in hopes of using it to lift pressure on their nuclear program . iranian-backed militias were on the ground in the iraqi town of amerli recently and provided the muscle that iraqi forces could not in ending a siege by isis .     while the administration insisted it would not work alongside mr. assad \u2019 s forces , the two sides were clearly working toward the same goal \u2014 leading to fears that the united states could essentially become mr. assad \u2019 s air force , at least temporarily , if it begins attacking isis emplacements in syria .     advertisement continue reading the main story     as described by american officials , the battle strategy calls for assembling a force first in iraq , where the iraqi army would be guided by 12-man teams of american \u201cadvisers \u201d that are expected to begin operating within days , and for new arms and other assistance for the kurdish forces . only later would the effort expand to syria , and the administration is pressing for a congressional vote this week on a $ 500 million arms package for \u201cmoderate \u201d members of the syrian opposition , now aimed at isis rather than the assad government .     officials acknowledged that the so-called moderate rebel forces were fractured and far weaker than isis . even so , administration officials struggled to explain whether the united states was at war with isis , as both the white house and the pentagon spokesman said it was last week , or whether it was engaged in a more traditional counterterrorism action . that was how mr. kerry characterized the strategy in an effort to make it easier for sunni states to explain to their own populations why they would be contributing forces against sunni extremists .     \u201coriginally this is not a war , \u201d mr. kerry said on cbs \u2019 s \u201cface the nation , \u201d trying to separate it from the military action in 2003 that he had opposed as a senator . \u201cthis is not combat troops on the ground . it \u2019 s not hundreds of thousands of people. \u201d he went on to compare it to \u201cwar with al qaeda and its affiliates , \u201d and said that \u201cin the same context \u201d the united states was \u201cat war with isil. \u201d\n"},
