controversy over the appointment of julie hermann as rutgers athletic director continued today as e-mails emerged showing infighting within the university over whether the new hire was properly vetted .     meanwhile , rutgers officials revealed they are paying a crisis communications firm $ 150,000 to help deal with the growing media scrutiny over the sports scandals that have engulfed the state university since early april .     in the latest development , a series of internal e-mails sent by members of the search committee that helped find hermann show some in the 28-member group felt the process of appointing a new athletic director was rushed .     reached by phone last night , committee member ronald garutti confirmed he and kenneth schmidt , a search committee member and member of the rutgers board of governors , were among those who sent sharply-worded e-mails to rutgers officials earlier this week criticizing the process that lead to the hiring of hermann .     \" there were flaws in this process , \" said garutti , a member of the rutgers board of trustees . \" to some degree , i was frustrated . \"     garutti , a 1967 rutgers graduate and retired schering-plough executive , said he did not leak the e-mails , which were first obtained by espn , and never intended them to be public . but he stands behind his belief that rutgers \u2019 search for a new athletic director was troubled .     garutti sent his e-mail to rutgers officials tuesday , responding to a message sent to members of the search committee by co-chairs kate sweeney and richard edwards supporting the process that led to hermann \u2019 s hiring from the university of louisville .     rutgers has been under fire since sunday when the star-ledger reported hermann was accused of mentally and verbally abusing student athletes . the accusations were contained in a letter written by her volleyball team when she was a coach at the university of tennessee in the 1990s .     the former tennessee players said they publicly rehashed their 17-year-old accusations partly because hermann had been hired by rutgers to help rebuild its sports program after basketball coach mike rice was fired for physically and verbally abusing his players .     hermann has denied abusing players and rutgers president robert barchi said monday she will keep her new job . but questions remain about why neither rutgers nor the search firm it used to screen candidates for the post knew about the accusations against hermann in tennessee .     in their e-mail to the search committee after the sunday star-ledger report , sweeney and edwards said the entire group had an opportunity vet hermann .     \" as members of the search advisory team , you all had the opportunity to examine julie \u2019 s credentials , to spend some time with her when she was on campus , and to provide us with your thoughts regarding her candidacy as rutgers \u2019 next director of intercollegiate athletics . as you know , there was strong support for julie , and for what she could bring to rutgers , \" wrote edwards , a rutgers executive vice president , and sweeney , an alumna and morgan stanley executive , according to a copy of the e-mail obtained by espn .     but garutti contends the committee never had the opportunity to properly screen hermann . he told the star-ledger the group received the names of the two finalists along with their resumes and biographical material on a sunday night . half the search committee was scheduled to interview both candidates for an hour each on monday , while the other half of the committee would meet the finalists tuesday .     \" it was not enough time . we only got the names of the two finalists sunday evening , \" garutti said . \" i was furiously reading and jotting notes . \"     though the process was supposed to be confidential , garutti said he was surprised the names of the two finalists \u2014 hermann and sean frazier , the deputy athletic director at wisconsin \u2014 were the same names he had seen reported in the star-ledger .     garutti said the materials the search committee received included no mention of accusations hermann abused players on her volleyball team at tennessee . there was also no mention she was named in a sex discrimination lawsuit while an administrator at louisville , he said .     the search committee members had read news accounts of hermann \u2019 s involvement in another lawsuit filed by an assistant coach at tennessee who contends the coach discouraged her from having a baby . but , with nearly 15 search committee members asking questions , the lawsuit never came up during hermann \u2019 s 75-minute interview , garutti said .     \" quite frankly , we didn \u2019 t have a chance to ask about it , \" garutti said .     schmidt also said in an e-mail obtained by espn that the process was flawed .     \" there was very little information about the candidates disseminated to the larger committee . most of the information we received was what leaked to the media \u2026 do not try and rewrite the facts , \" schmidt wrote in response to the message from sweeney and edwards that praised the process .     stefania balasa , the only student on the search committee , said she was surprised to see the string of e-mails from other search committee members criticizing the search process .     \" it was like a professional catfight in my e-mail inbox , \" said balasa , a rutgers senior and member of the university tennis team .     balasa said she would have asked more questions during hermann \u2019 s interview if she knew her full background . but she said she is frustrated that leaks to the news media continue to keep rutgers in the news and tarnish the school \u2019 s reputation .     \" i \u2019 m frustrated , especially because student athletes are the most directly affected , \" said balasa , 21 . \" we are suffering now because of the harsh media spotlight . \"     neither schmidt , sweeney nor edwards could be reached for comment by the star-ledger . several other members of the search committee declined to comment .     rutgers spokesman greg trevor also declined to comment on the e-mails . but , he said , the process of screening candidates involved more than the search committee .     \" it \u2019 s important to note that the search process had multiple levels , \" trevor said .     hermann was also vetted by a smaller executive committee at rutgers , which did most of the work of screening candidates , trevor said . the parker executive search firm , which was paid $ 70,000 to conduct the search , and a private security firm also vetted candidates . barchi , the school \u2019 s president , made the final decision to hire hermann .     as the controversy over the new athletic director continues , rutgers officials said they are using hill + knowlton , a global crisis communications firm with offices in new york , to help deal with the increased media attention . the firm was hired several weeks ago for $ 150,000 to help with the fallout over the basketball scandal .     connect     with

now , has never been documented by science : a killer whale drowning and killing an infant of the same species .     the incident took place on december 2 , 2016 off the coast of vancouver island , british columbia . now the sighting has been described in a paper published in the journal scientific reports .     the marine scientists were out on a research expedition when they detected strange calls on their vessel \u2019 s underwater microphones , alerting them to the presence of killer whales in their vicinity .     after finding the whales responsible for the noises , the researchers noticed some splashing that they thought might be a sign that the orcas were hunting . however , they quickly realized that an infant calf in the group wasn \u2019 t surfacing .     \" then a male , who was unrelated to the mother of the calf , swam past the boat with the calf hanging out of its mouth , and that ' s when we were really quite horrified and fascinated , \u201d jared towers , a cetacean researcher from fisheries and oceans canada , told cbc news .     the stricken calf \u2019 s mother and her relatives then frantically pursued the 32-year-old male in an attempt to rescue the youngster , but the male \u2014 with help from his own mother \u2014 managed to fend them off .     the researchers describe how the chase eventually ended with the mother of the infant hitting the male so hard with her flipper that blood flew through the air , although by this point , the calf was already dead .     this is the first time that a killer whale has been observed killing a calf of the same species , according to the study , although infanticide has been observed among many animals before .     \u201camong terrestrial mammals , it is mostly reported in primates , carnivores and rodents , \u201d the researchers wrote in the study . \u201chowever , compelling evidence for infanticide in cetaceans [ a group of animals containing whales , dolphins and porpoises ] exists in just three species of dolphin. \u201d     towers said the scene was distressing , however , the research team decided to watch until the end in the knowledge that they were witnessing a rare event .     because the offending male and his mother did not eat the dead infant , the scientists suggest that the killing may be an example of so-called \u201csexually selected behavior \u201d \u2014 which means that the male killed the calf to mate with its mother .     \" in other mammals , we know that in a lot of cases males kill infants , because it forces the infant ' s mom into a fertile state much quicker , \" towers said .     what is interesting in this case is that the mother of the male became involved in the killing .     \" killer whale moms are notorious for helping their adult sons and daughters by sharing food with them and leading them , and maybe even providing mating opportunities for adult male offspring , \" towers added .     the researchers say the recent findings cast doubt on some long-held assumptions regarding the sexual behavior of orcas . scientists have generally thought that female orcas have free reign when it come to choosing their mates because they are often found at the top of the pod hierarchy .     but in light of the recent encounter , towers suggests that the females may not have as much choice as previously believed .\n"}, {"url":

inslee on wednesday directed state agencies to take immediate and longer-term steps to protect the struggling killer whales .     the fish-eating mammals that spend time in puget sound have struggled for years with a lack of food , pollution , noise and disturbances from boat traffic . there are now just 76 of the orcas , down from 98 in 1995.     inslee said the orcas are in trouble and called on everyone in the state to do their part . his executive order aims to make more salmon available to the whales , give them more space and quieter waters , ensure they have clean water to swim in and protect them from potential oil spills .     \u201cthe destiny of salmon and orca and we humans are intertwined , \u201d the governor said at a news conference at the daybreak star cultural center in seattle . \u201cas the orca go , so go we. \u201d     an orca task force forming now will meet for the first time next month and will come up with final recommendations by november .     \u201cthis is a wake-up call , \u201d suquamish tribal chairman leonard forsman said , adding , \u201cit \u2019 s going to take some pain . we \u2019 re going to have to make some sacrifices. \u201d     many have been sounding the alarm for years about the plight of the closely tracked population of southern resident killer whales . the federal government listed the orcas as endangered in 2005 , and more recently identified them as among the most at risk of extinction in the near future .     a baby orca has not been born in the past few years . half of the calves born during a celebrated baby boom several years ago have died . female orcas also are having pregnancy problems linked to nutritional stress brought on by a low supply of chinook salmon , the whales \u2019 preferred food , a recent study said .     \u201cwe are not too late , \u201d said barry thom , west coast regional administrator for noaa fisheries . \u201cfrom a biology perspective , there are still enough breeding animals , but we need to act soon. \u201d     whale advocates welcomed the statewide initiative , saying it creates urgency and calls attention to the issue . but some also said it was long overdue .     \u201ci think that everybody would have loved to have seen this five years ago , \u201d said joe gaydos , science director for the seadoc society . \u201cit is a crisis . the fact that we \u2019 re responding is good. \u201d     under the order , state agencies will find ways to quiet state ferries around the whales , train more commercial whale-watching boats to help respond to oil spills and adjust fishing regulations to protect key areas and fish runs for orcas .     the whales use clicks , calls and other sounds to navigate , communicate and forage mainly for salmon , and noise from vessels can interfere .     lawmakers also passed a supplemental budget last week that includes $ 1.5 million for efforts such as a boost in marine patrols to ensure that boats keep their distance from orcas and an increase in hatchery production of salmon by an additional 5 million .     last year , the endangered orcas spent the fewest number of days in the central salish sea that spans washington and canada in four decades , mostly because there wasn \u2019 t enough salmon to eat , according to the center for whale research , which keeps the whale census for the federal government .     \u201ci applaud anything that helps ( the orcas ) through the short term , but the long term is what we really have to look at \u2014 and that \u2019 s the restoration of wild salmon stocks throughout washington state , \u201d ken balcomb , senior scientist with the center , said tuesday .     balcomb and others say aggressive measures are needed and they have called for the removal of four dams on the lower snake river to restore salmon runs .     j.t . austin , the governor \u2019 s senior policy adviser on natural resources issues , said inslee so far does not support removing those dams .\n"}, {"url": "file://train/40/2/1", "title": "train/40/2/1", "content": "kate middleton wears mom ' s blue dress for her first speech !     like mother , like daughter .         when kate

( gary sutton )     despite the fact that transient killer whales feed on other mammals , including seals , seal lions and young cetaceans from other species , the adult male and his mother did not feed on the baby orca .     that led the scientists to suspect this was an example of what ' s called sexually selected behaviour . in other words , they believe the 32-year-old male killed the calf so that he could mate with its mother .     \" in other mammals , we know that in a lot of cases males kill infants , because it forces the infant ' s mom into a fertile state much quicker , \" towers said .     a map shows the location of the attack .

leading them , and maybe even providing mating opportunities for adult male offspring , \" towers explained .     the encounter brings into question some previous assumptions about the sexual behaviour of killer whales . because female orcas are the leaders of their pods , researchers have often guessed that they could be choosy about their mates .     \" looking at the behaviour we ' ve observed , we ' re now beginning to think that it ' s quite possible that females don ' t have a lot of choice when it comes to breeding , \" towers said .     but he added that the infanticide proves that even after 40 years of observing orcas in the wild off the b.c . coast , there are still huge gaps in our knowledge about these marine mammals .\n"}, {"url": "file://train/40/2/0", "title":

"file://train/40/1/3", "title": "train/40/1/3", "content": "wct killer whales may be well adapted behaviourally for performing infanticide because of their experience killing other small cetaceans . individuals typically dispatch these prey by ramming or crushing them with their rostrums or tails36 . observations of infanticidal behaviour towards young common bottlenose dolphins , indo-pacific humpback dolphins and a guiana dolphin by conspecifics have included repeated ramming and crushing actions but also forced submergence4,5,6,7,8,9 . although we did not observe the first few minutes of this incident closely enough to determine the details of interactions that took place , it appeared as though t046b5 was quickly immobilized by having its tail gripped in the teeth of t068a and subsequently drowned because there was no opportunity to surface and breath due to his consistent forward motion . although both t068 and t068a were observed with fresh teeth scars after the incident , the only ramming behaviour we observed was performed by t046b toward her neonate\u00e2\u20ac \u2122s killer . this combative behaviour is similar to actions directed towards infanticidal males by the mothers of targeted infants in several rodent , primate and carnivore species ( see review in13 ) . the ramming occurred approximately ten minutes after the incident began , at which point the neonate would have been either close to or freshly drowned , which is probably why the fight did not persist . the brevity of this physical aggression might be typical of agonistic interactions between members of the wct killer whale population . this , in addition to the fact that most exchanges between individuals take place below the surface , may help explain why none of this nature have previously been observed . similarly , anomalistic calls are not commonly made by whales in this population42 , but as many animals are known to produce atypical sounds under stressful situations43 , the high number of aberrant and discrete pulsed calls and other excited sounds recorded before and during the infanticide event likely reflect the levels of intensity in the complex interactions taking place between individuals . for example , the fresh trauma observed on t046b4 at the beginning of this encounter indicates that other rough interaction between the whales occurred prior to our arrival . this may have caused the t046bs to separate into two groups to benefit the neonate and the other young animals through their disassociation from it , but vocalizations between them and their ultimate re-grouping may have revealed their locations to the t068s .     the motivation for t068a and t068 to make this attack is of particular interest , but that they carried it out cooperatively is not surprising because bonds between maternally related killer whales can be particularly strong34 . in sympatric populations , post-reproductive female killer whales increase the survival of adult sons by sharing ecological knowledge and prey with them44,45 . this benefits inclusive fitness of the female because a positive relationship exists between reproductive success and age in male killer whales45,46 . this combined with a prediction by connor et al.47 that post-reproductive female killer whales may play a role in acquiring mates for their adult male offspring suggests that t068\u00e2\u20ac \u2122s active involvement in this event was sexually selected , especially considering that t068a is of a reproductively mature age30,46 . the sexual selection hypothesis requires that the infanticidal male does not kill his own offspring , that the event provides a near future mating opportunity with the infants\u00e2\u20ac \u2122 mother and that he sires offspring with her12 . although it has been confirmed in many other mammal species that infanticidal males are not the fathers of their victims48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55 and that they subsequently sire offspring with the infants mothers13,15,51,53,55,56,57 , in this incident the neonate\u00e2\u20ac \u2122s carcass could not be recovered , t068a was not biopsied for dna analysis and t046b has not yet had another calf .     however , further evidence also suggests that the infanticidal teamwork of t068 and t068a was motivated by potential to increase their inclusive fitness . for example , young offspring are often selected for infanticide because new mothers return to estrus much quicker than those that have been lactating for longer periods of time12 . in this case , we know that t046b5 was less than a few days old and that suckling stimulates lactation in female killer whales whose postpartum return to estrus is much longer ( 5\u00e2\u20ac \u201c32 months ) when lactating than when not ( 1\u00e2\u20ac \u201c4 months ) 58. secondly , females in some animal societies copulate more with coercive males59,60 that restrict parental investment and improve the female condition by committing infanticide to increase their fitness61 . in this case , although it is not clear if the attack on t046b4 was attempted juvenilicide , this whale ( although third youngest in the group ) was t046bs second youngest offspring , so its death along with loss of her neonate could have benefitted her condition by reducing any prohibitive physical costs associated with caring for either of them . this would help restrict parental investment towards any forthcoming offspring of t068a if he successfully mated with t046b . furthermore , infanticidal males are typically not familiar with the infant\u00e2\u20ac \u2122s mothers13 and although unrelated matrilineal groups of wct killer whales have often been known to spend several weeks together40 in what have generally been perceived to be mutual associations , t068a , t068 and t046b had only been documented together on two previous occasions \u00e2\u20ac \u201c once in 2005 and again in 2007. the apparent low levels of association between these individuals suggest that they are not well known to each other and this may be reflective of inherent sexual conflict between their differing sex and age classes .     sexually selected infanticide in wct killer whales has important implications for our understanding of the social behaviour and evolution of this species ( supplementary discussion s1 ) and although in this case , the hypothesis cannot be proven , there is more supporting evidence for it than other hypotheses for this behaviour . for example , wct killer whales are well known for their dramatic hunting behaviour and protracted kills that typically result in immediate vocal and social activity , including division and consumption of mammalian prey36,62 . however , in this incident the vocal and social activity subsided once the kill was made and although the dead neonate was kept in the possession of its killers for at least 220\u00e2\u20ac \u2030minutes , there was no indication that it was dismembered or consumed . additionally , most prey species that wct killer whales target have been steadily increasing in coastal waters over the last few decades63,64,65,66,67,68,69 . these increases in prey availability have been commensurate with increasing social activity70 and higher recruitment within the wct population39 suggesting that it is not nutritionally stressed . thus , this incident is not easily explained by the predation hypothesis . furthermore , although the wct population has more than doubled in size since 199039 , there is little evidence available to suggest that individuals within it compete for habitat or prey71 . regardless , these and the availability of other resources such as mates would not easily be threatened by an infant of either sex due to the slow rate of maturation in this species . thus , this incident is not easily explained by the resource competition hypothesis . finally , there is little support for interpreting infanticide as a non-adaptive behaviour other than when it occurs by accident or under unnatural conditions13,53,72 and contrary to accidental or pathological explanations , the infanticidal behaviour of t068a and t068 appeared goal oriented because their chase led to an attack that was maintained until a particular outcome had been achieved . once it had , their behaviour immediately changed .     in conclusion , given that infanticide is so rarely observed in terrestrial mammals it is not surprising that it has taken many years of directed field observations to confirm that it does occur in cetaceans and more specifically , in killer whales . this species shares many life history traits with other mammals that are known to commit infanticide ( see1 ) , such as a high lactation to gestation ratio58 , a society where individuals live in stable mixed sex groups where calves are born year round71 and a breeding system that is monopolized by a minority of mature males46 . as a result , this phenomenon might be expected to occur in more killer whale populations than just the wct . in any case , additional study is required to investigate any impacts that this phenomenon may have on the evolution of the social structure of this population and the behaviour of individuals within it .\n"}]}, "user_id_to_descriptions": {"alice": "Is interested in compiling a summary.", "farshid": "Knows about the
