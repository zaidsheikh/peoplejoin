undersigned organizations and individuals , we call on local , state , and federal policymakers to address the damaging use of corporal punishment against our nation \u2019 s schoolchildren . it is important to eliminate the use of corporal punishment in both public schools and private schools , which serve students receiving federal services , as well as assist in creating a safer learning environment for every child . instead , we urge policymakers to ensure that our schools are places where students and educators interact in positive ways that foster students \u2019 growth and dignity .     more than 109,000 students were subjected to corporal punishment in public schools in the 2013-14 school year \u2014 down from 163,333 in the 2011-12 school year . despite the decline in instances and the many problems associated with the hitting or paddling of students , corporal punishment is a legal form of school discipline in 19 states . corporal punishment is often used for a wide range of misbehaviors ; for example , 37 percent of corporal punishment used in north carolina during the 2013-14 school year were for minor or subjective offenses like \u201cbus misbehavior , disrespect of staff , cell phone use , inappropriate language and other misbehaviors. \u201d aside from the infliction of pain and physical injury that often result from the use of physical punishment , these violent disciplinary methods impact students \u2019 academic achievement and long-term well-being . harsh physical punishments do not improve students \u2019 in-school behavior or academic performance . in fact , one study found that schools in states where corporal punishment is used perform worse on national academic assessments than schools in states that prohibit corporal punishment .     moreover , evidence indicates that corporal punishment is disproportionately applied against certain groups of students . in seven states in which corporal punishment was legal in the 2011-12 school year , black children were three to five times more likely to be corporally punished than white students . similarly , in several states in the 2011-12 school year , students with disabilities were over five times more likely to experience corporal punishment than students without disabilities . these students are often punished simply for behaviors related to their disabilities , such as autism or tourette \u2019 s syndrome . hitting any student should be an unacceptable practice , but the disproportionate application of corporal punishment against these populations further undermines their educational environment . furthermore , corporal punishment of adults has been banned in u.s. prisons and military training facilities . and every state has animal cruelty laws that criminalize beating animals so long and hard that it causes injury \u2014 even while allowing students to be subject to corporal punishment .     eliminating the use of corporal punishment in schools will assist in ensuring the safety of all students and educators . families should be allowed to protect their children and states should prohibit the use of physical punishment against students and ensure that a plan is in place to alert school personnel and parents of policies eliminating corporal punishment for students .     in addition , policymakers should also give schools and educators new tools to foster a positive school climate by encouraging the use of school-wide positive behavior supports , an evidence-based approach to school discipline proven to reduce school discipline referrals and support improved academic outcomes . local and state educational agencies should also take advantage of grants from the every student succeeds act , which provides funds to educational agencies to develop and implement restorative justice and positive behavioral supports and interventions in classrooms and schools and train teachers and staff in these methods .     all local and state educational agencies have a significant interest in ensuring a positive learning environment for the nation \u2019 s students . by eliminating the harmful practice of corporal punishment and implementing positive , evidence-based policies , local and state leaders can help students achieve access to a safe and high-quality education .     sincerely ,     national women \u2019 s law center

[ sexism in science : peer editor tells female researchers their study needs a male author ]     outside the twittersphere , the royal society distanced itself from hunt ' s remarks , reiterating its commitment to help women succeed in the sciences .     and why are hunt ' s feelings so troubling ? well , there ' s this problem we ' ve got where women are underrepresented in the sciences , math , technology and engineering . in fact , in britain ( hunt ' s home country ) only 13 percent of people working in stem are women . in science academia , 84 percent of full-time professors in the field are men . the situation in the united states is perhaps a bit better , with women getting a share of science doctorates that hovers just above 25 percent . one recent study claimed the problem had been solved , but other scientists were quick to dismantle the flaws in its methodology and cast doubt on its conclusions .     [ gender gap : women welcome in \u2018hard working \u2019 fields , but \u2018genius \u2019 fields are male-dominated , study finds ]     this isn ' t to say that hunt is the first nobel laureate to use his elevated status to share some problematic remarks . james watson is known for having some real zingers ( of the racist and sexist variety ) up his sleeve . what punishment did the politically correct hordes inflict on that soul ? well , he sold his nobel prize for $ 4 million , then had it returned to him by the russian billionaire who ' d bought it , as a gift . rough , i know .     hunt has since apologized via the bbc , but he seems to be as much in need of a lesson on proper apologies as he is on one in gender equality . from the bbc :     speaking to bbc radio 4 ' s today program , he said he was \" really sorry that i said what i said , \" adding it was \" a very stupid thing to do in the presence of all those journalists . \" the british biochemist , who became a royal society fellow in 1991 , said the remarks were \" intended as a light-hearted , ironic comment \" but had been \" interpreted deadly seriously by my audience . \" he went on to say he stood by some of the remarks . \" i did mean the part about having trouble with girls , \" he said . \" it is true that people -- i have fallen in love with people in the lab and people in the lab have fallen in love with me and it ' s very disruptive to the science because it ' s terribly important that in a lab people are on a level playing field . i found that these emotional entanglements made life very difficult . i ' m really , really sorry i caused any offense , that ' s awful . i certainly didn ' t mean that . i just meant to be honest , actually . \" on his remarks about women crying , he said : \" it ' s terribly important that you can criticize people ' s ideas without criticizing them and if they burst into tears , it means that you tend to hold back from getting at the absolute truth . \" science is about nothing but getting at the truth and anything that gets in the way of that diminishes , in my experience , the science . \"     honesty is obviously important , but -- really ? these remarks were only troublesome because journalists were there to be offended by them ? obviously no one can force hunt to be repentant for his personal belief that women are emotional time bombs , but a non-apology is never the answer . what ' s a non-apology ? here ' s a good summary from pacific standard magazine :     the term \u201cnon-apology \u201d first appeared in 1971 , but it wasn \u2019 t commonly used until the late ' 90s and then on into today . it \u2019 s when you apologize ... if you \u2019 ve offended anyone . \u201ci \u2019 m sorry ... if you felt this way. \u201d or when you say you \u2019 re sorry because you didn \u2019 t mean to do whatever terrible thing you ended up doing . it \u2019 s a conditional apology . it \u2019 s an apology , plus more some words that make it into something that \u2019 s not an apology .     as the ps mag piece goes on to explain , a non-apology is the aggressive version of an apology . to not apologize is passive , but to come out with one of these non-apologies shows an active refusal to admit your wrongdoing .     i ' ve come under fire for being like \" nah , that ' s sexist , \" before , so i decided to check my facts this time .     so , okay : hunt is revealing that he has trouble dealing with women . there are probably a lot of older male scientists who feel this way . i know , i know , we ladies totally crashed the party ! we ' re so cheeky .     if hunt said he wanted single-sex labs because he couldn ' t help falling in love with female lab scientists -- well , that ' s kind of icky , too . but it ' s his insistence -- even in his apology -- that women , as a group , cry to get what they want that really sticks the landing .

( also , how would that even work ? where would people outside the gender binary go ? would labs full of non-heterosexuals descend into the same weepy , chaotic interpersonal jumble that hunt fears ? i have questions. )     but let ' s call this what it really is : just the inescapable truth for countless women working in science . they have colleagues -- bosses in position of great power , even , with globally recognized accolades -- who seem to genuinely believe they just can ' t help but cry when they ' re criticized . they can ' t help it , mind , it ' s a lady problem . and that ' s no way to do science now , is it ?
