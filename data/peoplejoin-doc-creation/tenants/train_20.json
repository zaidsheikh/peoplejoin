( wyoming area school district )     peter butera , class president for the entirety of his life as a high school student \u2014 all four often-frustrating years of it \u2014 took the stage at friday \u2019 s graduation ceremony after the recital of the class poem , which had offended no one .     when the principal of wyoming area secondary center in exeter , pa. , had finished applauding the poem , butera walked up and laid his speech on the podium : the lines he \u2019 d dutifully cleared with administrators , and those he had not .     butera was 18 , bound for villanova university in a few months . he was his class valedictorian , and he was beginning to get nervous about his plan to go rogue at the last possible minute .     \u201cgood evening , everyone , \u201d butera began , innocuously enough . \u201cthe past four years at wyoming area have been very interesting , to say the least. \u201d     [ the valedictorian who was kicked off stage for an unapproved speech got to finish it \u2014 on kimmel ]     across the field , by the running track , butera \u2019 s family watched with his girlfriend , who was taking video . in front of the stage sat nearly 200 classmates , nearly all of whom butera said he knew well , for he had lived here his whole life .     on the chair to butera \u2019 s left sat the principal , jon pollard , who barely looked up at him .     \u201cto everyone here today , we cannot thank you enough for everything you \u2019 ve done for us , \u201d butera said .     pollard scratched his face . so far so good . butera kept thanking people for a while : teachers he was close to , \u201ca couple great administrators as well. \u201d     he did not name pollard among them \u2014 an omission not lost on one of the few people there who knew exactly how his speech would end .     \u201cit was always dr. pollard , \u201d albert sciandra , butera \u2019 s friend and vice president in the student government , told the washington post . \u201che was the one who kept shooting everything peter wanted to do down. \u201d     the day before the ceremony , sciandra said , the school had put on a talent show . butera wanted to do a comedy skit : poke fun at the only teacher who ate the cafeteria lunch , stuff like that .     but such jokes were deemed too extreme , sciandra said . \u201cpeter rewrote them so many times . pollard said , \u2018you \u2019 re not doing it because i said so. \u2019 \u201d     [ a teacher \u2019 s decision to be \u2018visibly queer \u2019 in his photo with president trump ]     all of high school had been like that , sciandra told the post . no matter that they \u2019 d both been in student government every single year , he said \u2014 any idea that went beyond decorations for some school-approved event got shot down .     so when , a week or so before the ceremony , butera told his friend that he \u2019 d written a secret end to the approved speech \u2014 that he planned to expose a system he saw as a sham \u2014 sciandra understood it had to be done .     though as he sat on the field friday , sciandra still doubted his class president would go through with it .     butera \u2019 s speech was now nearing its end . \u201ci have pursued every leadership opportunity available to me , \u201d he told the crowd . he \u2019 d been repeatedly elected class president . an honor each time .     \u201ci would like to thank you all for that one final time , \u201d he said . \u201cit really means a lot. \u201d     but it hadn \u2019 t meant much to the school , he was thinking , butera later told the washington post . he was remembering the past summer , when he and sciandra organized protests of a proposed dress code .     \u201cme and peter , we went to every council meeting and school-board meeting , \u201d sciandra said . they packed the seats with students and parents and made speeches , and filled a petition with signatures .     and none of it mattered , the students said : the dress code passed anyway .     \u201cit really means a lot , \u201d butera continued from the stage .     \u201chowever \u2026 \u201d     pollard still was not looking at him , but sciandra braced in his seat .     \u201cat our school , the title of class president can more accurately be class party planner , \u201d butera said . \u201cstudent council \u2019 s main obligation is to paint signs every week. \u201d     at that moment , from his chair , pollard made what may have been a grimace and finally turned to watch the valedictorian as he hit the climax of his speech .     \u201cdespite some of the outstanding people in our school , \u201d butera went on , \u201ca lack of a real student government combined with the authoritative attitude that a few teachers , administrators and board members have \u2026 \u201d     the principal mouthed something to someone offstage .     \u201d \u2026 prevented students from truly developing as true leaders \u2026 \u201d     a mechanical bang interrupted his words as the microphone shut down . when butera spoke his next line , his voice was naked . he had not expected that .     \u201chopefully this will change , \u201d he said , speaking louder , trying to be heard .     \u201chopefully , for the sake of future students , more people in this school \u2014 \u201d     [ a radio host was warned not to criticize president trump . so he quit. ]     butera would have said more . he would have said he hoped future classes would have more educators who valued empowering students as much as they valued educating them . that leadership is a hard thing to learn within the strictures of a public school system .     \u201cit is not what we have done as wyoming area students or athletes that will define our lives , \u201d he had written on the paper his principal had not seen , \u201cbut what we will go on to do as wyoming area alumni. \u201d     butera didn \u2019 t get to say the last lines . now pollard was on his feet , tapping the student \u2019 s elbow , mouthing something above a dead microphone .     \u201che said , \u2018alright peter . you \u2019 re done , \u2019 \u201d butera told the post .     but neither man could be heard now . the field was erupting with cheers , boos and screams : \u201clet him speak ! let him speak ! let him speak ! \u201d     in the back , by butera \u2019 s mother , father , girlfriend , grandma , aunt and uncle , someone said : \u201ci \u2019 m so proud. \u201d     the rest of the ceremony would go more or less as officials had planned . the faculty would take turns making speeches . pollard would give the class of 2017 his advice : \u201cread good books and watch bad movies , \u201d and \u201cclean your room and learn to do you own laundry. \u201d and \u201cwatch what you put on social media. \u201d     irony . a few days after the ceremony , a grainy video of butera \u2019 s speech spread wildly across the internet \u2014 more than 75,000 endorsements on reddit alone . then came the news stories . while pollard didn \u2019 t immediately respond to the post , superintendent janet serino defended his silencing .     \u201cthe young man submitted his graduation speech to his principal and delivered a speech different from the speech that was submitted , \u201d she wrote . but she had since reached out to butera , requesting a meeting to discuss his concerns .     wyoming area secondary center \u2019 s valedictorian for 2017 had not called out his principal or superintendent or anyone else in his speech \u2014 not the approved version , or the rogue ending , or even the part he didn \u2019 t get to read .     and butera declined to criticize any school authority by name when he spoke to the post . he said that hadn \u2019 t been the point of his final act as class president .     \u201ci \u2019 m supposed to represent the students , \u201d he said .     and on his last day of high school , when the principal cut off his microphone and waved him off the stage and he walked back to his seat through a standing ovation , he felt that he finally had .     more reading :     the story behind a powerful photo of a czech

in a jailhouse beating that was intended to keep him quiet about the toronto mayor ' s abuse of alcohol and illegal drugs , it has been alleged in a lawsuit .     the 2012 jailhouse assault of scott macintyre was orchestrated by aedan petros , mr. macintyre has alleged in a statement of claim . mr. petros is a 300-pound , violent criminal who played defensive tackle for mr. ford when he was the coach of the football team at don bosco catholic secondary school .     when mr. macintyre was attacked in the shower on march 22 , 2012 , at the toronto west detention centre , it came after several weeks of threats from inmates who urged the 46-year-old repeat offender to \" do the right thing , \" mr. macintyre said separately in an hour-long interview with the globe and mail .     story

petros \u2013 a 22-year-old who was jailed in connection with an armed robbery and home invasion and has since been sentenced to five years in a federal penitentiary \u2013 repeatedly approached mr. macintyre with warnings , such as \" there is no use in bringing rob into this ; what ' s done behind closed doors stays behind closed doors . \u2026 stuff of that nature , \" mr. macintyre said . the statement of claim , filed in toronto on wednesday , makes similar allegations about the threats .     an official with the ministry of correctional services , who spoke on condition of anonymity , confirmed to the globe that mr. petros was housed in the same unit of the jail , known as 1b , as mr. macintyre at the time of the assault .     brent ross , a ministry spokesman , said an investigation into the beating had been launched , but he declined to release its findings , citing concerns about jail security . mayor ford did not respond to a list of questions that was sent to him by e-mail and in a letter . he did , however , speak about the globe ' s inquiries with the toronto sun , telling the newspaper that any suggestion that he played a role in the beating is \" far fetched \" and \" way out there . \" mr. ford ' s lawyer and close adviser , dennis morris , said the notion that the mayor had advance knowledge of the attack on mr. macintyre was \" insanity . \"     mr. morris said the allegations in the lawsuit are \" without fact or foundation . \" mr. ford has retained gavin tighe , a bay street litigator , to represent him in the civil suit . mr. macintyre is being represented by sean dewart and tim gleason , who declined comment .     none of the claims in mr. macintyre ' s lawsuit , which lists mr. ford , mr. petros , another former football coach named payman aboodowleh , as well as the minister of correctional services as defendants , have been proven in court .     the lawsuit touches on one of the more enduring mysteries of the scandal that has engulfed mayor ford since he became the focus of a sweeping police investigation and admitted to smoking crack cocaine : what was an ontario provincial court judge referring to in 2012 when he said he inferred that mr. macintyre was beaten in jail because he was \" a bother to mr . ford ? \"     mr. macintyre wound up in jail in january , 2012 , after police were called to mayor ford ' s house because of a confrontation between the mayor and mr. macintyre , which culminated with mr. macintyre threatening to kill mr. ford .
