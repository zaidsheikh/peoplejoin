a remote area in cass county , where human bones were found monday evening by a mushroom hunter , and now remains of a second person have been found nearby in the area on tuesday .     authorities with cass county now say they have found a second human skull in the wooded area near e. 233rd and state route y , south of belton , where they found the first human skull on monday . they also say they have been in contact with the families of kara koptesky and jessica runions , two young women missing from the kansas city area , but could not confirm if the remains were that of these missing women .     kara ' s mother and jessica ' s mother have become friends , sharing the common and devastating bond of missing a child .     \" i don ' t think i could get through this without them and my family and friends , \" said jamie runions , jessica ' s mom . \" it ' s just hard . it ' s the hardest thing anybody would have to go through . \"     \" we are a team and when you have a missing child \u2026 people can say they understand how you feel but unless you have another child that \u2019 s missing , you don \u2019 t , \" said beckford , kara kopetsky ' s mother . \" it \u2019 s not

yy-hwy and d-hwy ( holmes road ) for the search . the road closure began at 12 : 30 p.m. and is expected to continue until dark . it could even continue until wednesday .     kara kopetsky , from belton , has been missing since may 2007 , and jessica runions , a raymore woman disappeared in september 2016. kopetsky was last seen leaving belton high school on may 4 , 2007 and has not been seen since . runions was last seen at a party sept. 8 , 2016 with her boyfriend and one of his friends , kylr yust .     \" my feeling is kara is gone but of course there is always that doubt in the back of your mind when you don \u2019 t know 100 percent . you always hold onto that hope that \u2019 s what you go on . but we need a resolution to this and we need to find out what happened to our girls

charged in her disappearance , but she and her mother , rhonda beckford , filed a restraining order against him shortly before she vanished . the order wasn \u2019 t officially granted until after she disappeared .     yust was also a friend of jessica runions . he has been charged in jackson county with ' knowingly burning ' in connection to jessica runions ' case and car . he was arrested in september 2016 at his family ' s home in edwards , mo. , in benton county , about two hours from kansas city . he has not faced additional charges related to her disappearance .     in 2011 , yust , then 22 , was charged with two counts of animal abuse , including smashing a kitten against a bathroom floor . according to prosecutors , yust allegedly smashed the head of a kitten against a bathroom floor on july 5 , 2011 , and then allegedly drowned two kittens in a bag in an area creek on july 20 , 2011.     a week before the animal abuse charges , yust was placed on two years probation after pleading guilty to beating and choking his 18-year-old pregnant girlfriend . according to police reports , yust allegedly told the teen that he could dispose of body parts in a pig pen on a family ranch .     family and friends of both woman have been searching for clues in their disappearance but have had no luck . just in january , groups searching for runions ' body found two bodies while searching , but neither of those bodies belong to either of these women .     according to captain kevin tieman , the skull recovered monday has been sent to the jackson county medical examiner for
