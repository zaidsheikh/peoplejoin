( associated press )     scientists have finally recovered stem cells from cloned human embryos , a longstanding goal that could lead to new treatments for such illnesses as parkinson ' s disease and diabetes .     a prominent expert called the work a landmark , but noted that a different , simpler technique now under development may prove more useful .     stem cells can turn into any cell of the body , so scientists are interested in using them to create tissue for treating disease . transplanting brain tissue might treat parkinson ' s disorder , for example , and pancreatic tissue might be used for diabetes .     but transplants run the risk of rejection , so more than a decade ago , researchers proposed a way around that : create tissue from stem cells that bear the patient ' s own dna , obtained with a process called therapeutic cloning .     if dna from a patient is put into a human egg , which is then grown into an early embryo , the stem cells from that embryo would provide a virtual genetic match . so in theory , tissues created from them would not be rejected by the patient .     that idea was met with some ethical objections because harvesting the stem cells involved destroying human embryos .     scientists have tried to get stem cells from cloned human embryos for about a decade , but they ' ve failed . generally , that ' s because the embryos stopped developing before producing the cells . in 2004 , a south korean scientist claimed to have gotten stem cells from cloned human embryos , but that turned out to be a fraud .     in wednesday ' s edition of the journal cell , however , scientists in oregon report harvesting stem cells from six embryos created from donated eggs . two embryos had been given dna from skin cells of a child with a genetic disorder , and the others had dna from fetal skin cells .     shoukhrat mitalipov of the oregon health &amp; science university , who led the research , said the success came not from a single technical innovation , but from revising a series of steps in the process . he noted it had taken six years to reach the goal after doing it with monkey embryos .     mitalipov also said that based on monkey work , he believes human embryos made with the technique could not develop into cloned babies , and he has no interest in trying to do that . scientists have cloned more than a dozen kinds of mammals , starting with dolly the sheep .     the new work was financed by the university and the leducq foundation in paris .     dr. george daley , a stem cell expert at children ' s hospital boston who didn ' t participate in the work , called the new results \" one landmark step in a very long journey \" toward creating dna-matched transplant tissue .     now , daley said , scientists must compare the embryo-cloning approach with another technology that reprograms blood or skin cells directly into substitutes for embryonic stem cells . this reprogramming approach is technically simpler and doesn ' t involve embryos or require the donation of human eggs , and it was widely acclaimed when it was reported in 2007. its japanese developer shared a nobel prize last year .     but these substitute cells show some molecular differences compared to embryonic ones , which has led to questions about whether they can safely be used for treating patients . so it ' s essential to compare the cells from the two methods , daley said .     the new results mean \" we have another tool , \" he said . \" we have to learn more about this tool . \"     daley said he believed scientists will prefer using the reprogramming approach unless it can be proven \" beyond a shadow of a doubt \" that embryo cloning produces better cells for treating patients .     mitalipov said he believed his technique would present a particular advantage for treating patients with a certain type of rare diseases . these are caused by mutations in genes of the mitochondria , the power plants of cells . he noted his technique , unlike the cell-reprogramming approach , would supply tissue with new mitochondrial genes that could replace defective ones . those new genes would come from the egg .     the rev . tad pacholczyk , director of education for national catholic bioethics center , an independent think tank in philadelphia , reiterated his opposition to embryo cloning , calling the approach unethical .     \" it involves the decision to utilize early human beings as repositories for obtaining desired cells , \" he said . \" you ' re creating them only to destroy them . \"     marcy darnovsky , executive director of the center for genetics and society in berkeley , california , said she was glad that mitalipov doubted the embryos could be used to clone babies . she said the report still provides a good opportunity for the federal government to ban the use of cloning for reproduction .\n"}, {"url": "file://test/29/1/1", "title": "test/29/1/1", "content": "focused crawls

to the warehouse in feltham , middlesex by climbing onto the roof , cutting holes through the reinforced skylights , and then abseiling down into the building .     the heist , which took place on the evening of january 29 , was captured on the warehouse ' s cctv cameras , the mail on sunday reports .     thieves were observed ignoring all other items stored in the warehouse , instead targeting four containers that stored rare books . a source told the mail on sunday that the gang of criminals checked the contents of the containers against a list , \" throwing the ones they didn ' t want away . \" the books were being stored in the warehouse temporarily as they made their way to the california book fair .     the gang then placed the rare books into holdalls and pulled them onto the roof of the building using ropes . the bags were then placed into a van and driven away .     the mail on sunday reports that the thieves likely stole the books to order , as it would be difficult to resell the titles . the newspaper says that scientific works , of the type stolen in the raid , \" are particularly in demand . \" it speculates that a wealthy collector known as \" the astronomer \" may have ordered gangs to steal books for him .     the most valuable book stolen in the raid is a 1566 edition of \" de revolutionibus orbium coelestium \" by copernicus . the book , which can be translated as \" on the revolutions of the heavenly spheres , \" set out copernicus ' theory that the sun is at the centre of the universe , not the earth .     the owner of the rare copernicus book stolen in the raid , identified only as a dealer from padua in italy , told the mail on sunday that \" it was clearly a robbery done to order . it was a specialised gang . they took only books , nothing else . \"     the international league of antiquarian booksellers has published two separate lists detailing every book believed to have been stolen in the heist . it lists two dealers who have had stock stolen from them : librario bado e mart s.a.s . di bado r. e c. from padua , italy , and michael ku\u0308hn from berlin , germany .     another book that is believed to have been stolen is a 1656 galileo book titled \" opere di galileo galilei , \" another early scientific work about the universe .     a copy of \" philosophi\u00e6 naturalis principia mathematica \" by isaac newton was also stolen in the raid . the book was a landmark work covering physics and mathematics .     a 1506 edition of dante ' s \" divine comedy \" was also stolen in the raid .\n"}, {"url":

pizzoli/afp/getty images     in a rare book heist described as \u201cextraordinary \u201d for its mission : impossible-style stealth , a gang of thieves has stolen more than \u00a3 2m worth of antiquarian books from a london warehouse . the three tome-raiders evaded the security system by boring holes through reinforced glass skylights and abseiling 40ft on ropes into the repository . the haul of more than 160 books included a 1566 copy of de revolutionibus orbium coelestium by copernicus , worth an estimated \u00a3 215,000 , as well as works by galileo , isaac newton , leonardo da vinci and a 1569 edition of dante \u2019 s divine comedy .     the question is , what happens to the books now ? how might they be sold ? and who would buy them ? \u201ccriminals first try to cash out on these crimes , \u201d leading art lawyer chris marinello , ceo of london based art recovery international , tells me . \u201cthey are looking for buyers and the more publicity the crime gets , they more difficult it becomes to sell these items . placing them on international databases , such as artive.org , which records stolen objects so they can not be sold knowingly in the marketplace , means reputable dealers and collectors will not touch them. \u201d     marinello , who has been working to reduce the trade in illicit cultural heritage for three decades , explains that this , unfortunately , is when the \u201csecond crime \u201d often takes places . \u201cthe books might then be broken up , \u201d he says . \u201csome of the illuminated manuscripts and engravings contained therein might be traded in the art market , where many buyers don \u2019 t know they were cut out of rare books . it becomes a lot more difficult to trace. \u201d     the theft of rare books , manuscripts and maps from libraries and other repositories is thought to be on the rise . an alarmingly titled conference at the british library in 2015 , the written heritage of mankind in peril , was prompted by two major heists at european libraries , both of which turned out to be inside jobs . what continues to confound the international rare book market \u2013 estimated to be worth $ 500m ( \u00a3 380m ) a year \u2013 is how easily stolen books are fenced and resold .     so what \u2019 s the solution ? \u201cit \u2019 s urgent at this point that the victims come forward and record these losses , \u201d marinello says . \u201cit \u2019 s really important to make these books unsellable by disseminating that information . that \u2019 s the key . in my experience the books will either turn up very shortly or when the criminals know they can \u2019 t sell them they \u2019 ll go underground and be traded or sold at 5 % -10 % of their true value . we might expect a ransom demand as well from someone looking to shake down an insurance company . the next few days and weeks are very important from an investigative point of view. \u201d     does he believe , as some are saying , that the books might have been stolen to order by a specialist collector ? \u201ci would strongly refute that , \u201d he replies . \u201ci think this was more likely similar to the lufthansa heist in goodfellas , where somebody had inside information that they were being kept in a warehouse and were particularly valuable . then someone allowed that information to leak out , and criminals took advantage. \u201d\n"}]}, "user_id_to_descriptions": {"alice": "Is interested in compiling a summary.", "bhushan": "Knows about the following topics:\nTruth and Reconciliation Commission,
