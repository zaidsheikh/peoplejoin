a group of paddle boarders .     natural resources police said cody iorns , 25 , of washington d.c. was pronounced dead at anne arundel medical center after attempts to resuscitate him failed .     spokeswoman candy thomson said iorns was part of a group of four paddle boarders who were on the water off tolly point around 6 : 30 p.m. one of the people in the group saw iorns face down in the water behind them and they attempted to rescue him and bring him to shore , thomson said .     at a press conference thursday afternoon , maryland natural resources police capt . brian rathgeb said iorns suffered undetermined medical distress while on the water . an autopsy is being conducted thursday in baltimore to determine the cause of death .     rathgeb said iorns was wearing an inflatable life jacket , but the device did not inflate .     he had three people with him \u2014 they started performing cpr , according to thomson . one went ashore seeking help , rathgeb said . an anne arundel county fire department boat picked iorns up from the water .     he was taken to anne arundel medical center where he was pronounced dead , he said .     iorns was a double amputee and army veteran who was well-known in the paddle boarding community . he paddle boarded with the help of prosthetic limbs .     capital sup , a paddle boarding group and business in annapolis , said in a statement on facebook that iorns \u201cwent out for a downwind paddle with fellow capital sup paddlers and unexpectedly drowned. \u201d     \u201cwe are still processing how it happened , \u201d the group wrote . \u201cwe are at a loss for words . he was our brother . he was an inspiration to everyone on and off the water. \u201d     iorns was profiled by national geographic last year , which described him as a competitive paddle boarder who \u2019 d lost his arms in a motorcycle accident .     in the piece , the publication said he was a former army medic who trained and competed with capital sup \u2019 s \u201cwater warriors \u201d program for veterans .     in an interview , iorns described the challenges of paddle boarding while being an amputee , saying \u201cwhenever i paddle board , it \u2019 s a team sport because someone is getting my board , someone \u2019 s helping me with my arms , so that \u2019 s my team. \u201d     \u201c80 percent of my goal is accomplished by making it to the race , \u201d he said .     it was one of three separate incidents that happened out on the chesapeake bay during choppy conditions wednesday afternoon , and brings the number of boating-related deaths this year to 10. by this time last year there had been four boating-related deaths , rathgeb said . the state saw nine , boating-related deaths in 2017.     \u201cwe \u2019 re on pace for one of the deadliest years boating-wise in maryland , \u201d he said .     emergency crews are continuing their search today for a missing boater who fell overboard off of a 40-foot cabin cruiser between kent narrows and herrington harbor south .     thomson said kevin yates sr. , 41 , of queen anne \u2019 s county , was helping another boater who \u2019 d recently purchased a boat in kent narrows to move it over to herrington harbor south around 2 : 45 p.m. wednesday .     yates was helping the other man to move the boat to herrington harbor south while wind gusts were up to 25 knots as he was a more experienced boater , thomson said .     at one point , yates needed to use the bathroom and handed the helm over to the other boater , thomson said .     it is believed that yates fell off the vessel sometime during this period , as thomson said the other boater stayed at the helm for about an hour , uncomfortable leaving it unmanned .     \u201cwe have a very very large search area , \u201d rathgeb said at the press conference . \u201cwe \u2019 re basically searching between poplar island and herring bay , so eastern shore to the western shore. \u201d     he was last seen wearing blue shorts and a dark shirt with no life jacket . they are continuing to search with aviation units and boats thursday , rathgeb said .     in another incident , a 6-year-old boy who stepped off a crabbing pier at sandy point state park is expected to survive . the water level was almost flush with the pier when the child stepped off , rathgeb said .     thomson said that he was with his family having a picnic at the park and went to the crabbing pier where he was swept into the water during particularly rough conditions .     the boy \u2019 s father jumped into the water after him and brought him back to shore , thomson said .     the boy was taken to johns hopkins with non-life threatening injuries and is okay now , rathgeb said .     of the 10 boating-related deaths in maryland so far this year , four have occurred in anne arundel county .     a common theme for almost all the fatalities is that the person wasn \u2019 t wearing a life jacket , rathgeb said . inflatable life jackets also work , and are worn by natural resources police officers . the inflatable jackets are less bulky , making people more likely to wear them , he said . in iorns \u2019 case the device wasn \u2019 t working properly , he said .     \u201cthey \u2019 re great as long as you maintain them and keep up with them , \u201d he said .     caption surveillance video provided by

he became well known in the local water sports community .     iorns died wednesday evening after venturing out into the chesapeake bay from annapolis , md , according to maryland natural resources

wednesday with three other paddlers , thomson said . the plan was to launch from thomas point and head toward spa creek about five miles away , returning to land about an hour-and-a-half later .     as a precaution , somebody in the group sent maryland natural resources police a message with their route , thomson said .     but the conditions were rocky .     \" we had a huge high tide because of
