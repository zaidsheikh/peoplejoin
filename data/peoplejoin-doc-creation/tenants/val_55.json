to kill the mother of his three children , noela rukundo , when she was attending her stepmother ' s funeral in burundi in early 2015.     the group snatched ms rukundo at gunpoint outside her hotel in bujumbura in february and drove her to a secret location .     they told her her partner had paid for her to be murdered , but because they did not want to kill a woman , and they knew ms rukundo ' s brother , they would not carry out the killing .     they gave ms rukundo recorded telephone conversations between them and kalala planning the hit , as well as receipts from western union showing proof of kalala ' s payment .     while ms rukundo was in burundi , kalala , of kings park , was at home looking after the couple ' s three children and his partner ' s five children from a previous relationship .     believing the murder plot had been executed , he told friends that his wife had been killed in a tragic accident while she was in africa .     the african community gathered round

called the police .     in september , kalala pleaded guilty to one count of incitement to murder .     kalala ' motivated by unfounded jealousy '     in sentencing , chief justice marilyn warren said the crime involved a great breach of trust .     \" had ms rukundo ' s kidnappers completed the job , eight children would have lost their mother , \" she said .     \" it was premeditated and motivated by unfounded jealousy , anger and a desire to punish ms rukundo . \"     she said people should expect protection from the partners , not violence .     chief justice warren said kalala had been a hard worker and of good standing in the australian community prior to this charge .     she also took into account his troubled childhood in war-torn africa , and the fact his wife and child had been brutally murdered in the democratic republic of congo when he was aged 24.     outside court , ms rukundo ' s son fostin said his mother still lived in fear .     fostin said he was upset by the kidnapping .     \" she works for us , she feeds us , she clothed us and she was doing the same thing for [ kalala ] ...     \" i looked at him ( in court ) but i couldn ' t see a man . because i

officials , retaliating for what the treasury department calls the \" unfair and unjust detention \" of an american pastor in izmir . the penalties announced wednesday , which aim to punish the chiefs of turkey ' s ministries of justice and the interior , mark a significant escalation in the recent frictions between the two key nato allies .     but they are not altogether unexpected : both president trump and vice president pence have both lately threatened retaliation over the status of andrew brunson , whom turkish authorities detained in october 2016. he has been charged with engaging in espionage and aiding terrorist groups .     the 50-year-old evangelical presbyterian minister , who hails from north carolina but has spent more than two decades in turkey , was swept up in ankara ' s wide-ranging crackdown after a failed coup against president recep tayyip erdogan . now under house arrest , brunson faces up to 35 years in prison if convicted of all charges .     and on wednesday the treasury department laid blame for his ongoing trial primarily with abdulhamit gul , turkey ' s justice minister , and turkish interior minister suleyman soylu . the sanctions against them prohibit u.s. citizens from doing business with both men and block any of their property that rests within american jurisdiction .     \" pastor brunson ' s unjust detention and continued prosecution by turkish officials is simply unacceptable , \" treasury secretary steven mnuchin said in a statement . \" president trump has made it abundantly clear that the united states expects turkey to release him immediately . \"     u.s. secretary of state mike pompeo has also discussed the matter several times with his turkish counterpart , mevlut cavusoglu , according to state department spokesperson heather nauert . and during a press briefing tuesday , she noted that brunson is not the only detained individual they ' re seeking to get released : she says the state department has also been advocating on behalf of several locally hired personnel who were also swept up in the arrests after the attempted coup .     \" turkey knows our position well , \" she said wednesday . \" this has gone on far too long . \"     the turkish ministry of foreign affairs promised wednesday to retaliate with \" an equivalent response \" if the u.s. does not walk back \" this wrong decision . \"     \" there is no doubt that the decision , which disrespectfully intervenes with our judicial system , stands in contrast to the essence of our relations and will seriously damage the constructive efforts made in order to resolve problems between the two countries , \" the ministry added .     in a tweet translated by the state-run anadolu news agency , cavusoglu also vowed that the \" us attempt to impose sanctions on our two ministers will not go unanswered . \"     faced with pressure from u.s. officials last year , erdogan suggested brunson ' s release may depend on u.s. compliance with one of his own demands : the extradition of elderly fethullah gulen , whom erdogan has repeatedly accused of organizing the 2016 coup from his compound in pennsylvania , despite gulen ' s denials .     \" \" you have a pastor too , \" erdogan said then . \" you give us that one and we ' ll work with our judiciary and give back yours . \"     u.s. officials , for their
