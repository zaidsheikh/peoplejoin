( baseball did not yet have the advisory medical panel. ) on feb. 16 , 2007 , two days before rodriguez reported to spring training , smith granted the exemption , allowing rodriguez to use testosterone all season .     the exemption was revealed in a transcript of rodriguez \u2019 s fall 2013 grievance hearing . during that proceeding , mlb entered into evidence several exemptions applied for by rodriguez during his yankees tenure . in his testimony , mlb chief operating officer rob manfred called testosterone \u201cthe mother of all anabolics \u201d and said that exemptions for the substance are \u201cvery rare , \u201d partly because \u201csome people who have been involved in this field feel that with a young male , healthy young male , the most likely cause of low testosterone requiring this type of therapy would be prior steroid abuse. \u201d     statistics requested in 2008 by massachusetts congressman john tierney as part of a government probe into baseball \u2019 s ped problem reveal how rare testosterone exemptions are . in 2007 , of the 1,354 players subjected to testing , 111 were granted a tue . only two , apparently including rodriguez , received an exemption for \u201candrogen deficiency medications , \u201d the category that would include testosterone . the other exemptions that year involved treatments for baldness , hypertension and -- predominantly -- attention deficit disorder . the alarmingly high number of exemptions for the latter was tierney \u2019 s main concern . \u201ci think it begs a question : are people using this as a loophole ? \u201d said tierney . \u201care they taking these because they are perceived as a performance-enhancing drug , or do they have a legitimate medicinal purpose ? \u201d     *****     during the 2007 world series , as the red sox were sweeping the rockies for their second championship in four seasons , rodriguez hijacked the headlines by opting out of his contract with the yankees . six weeks later , the team signed him to a 10-year deal that guaranteed him $ 275 million to stay in pinstripes until ' 17 . in addition , the yankees added $ 6 million-a-pop clauses for each all-time home run leader he passed , starting with willie mays at 660 and ending with barry bonds at 762.     even after securing his latest windfall , rodriguez wasn \u2019 t done seeking exemptions that allowed him to boost his testosterone levels with banned substances . in january 2008 , according to the arbitration hearing transcripts , he requested two exemptions . rodriguez wanted to use clomiphene citrate ( clomid ) , a drug designed to increase fertility in women . it is also prescribed to men who suffer from hypogonadism -- a testosterone deficiency -- to block the production of estrogen in their bodies . the drug is popular with bodybuilders at the end of steroid cycles because it can also stimulate the body to make more testosterone .     rodriguez also requested permission to use human chorionic gonadotropin , a hormone known as hcg , popularly -- and misguidedly -- used for weight loss and also to produce testosterone . both hcg and clomiphene citrate were banned with the 2008 season . smith approved rodriguez \u2019 s use of clomiphene citrate that year . the exemption for hcg was denied , but according to the transcript of manfred \u2019 s arbitration testimony , that denial was \u201cmore of a recordkeeping thing than anything else. \u201d rodriguez \u2019 s physician communicated with smith , and \u201cin their back-and-forth the physician informed dr. smith that the player was no longer using [ hcg ] , \u201d manfred testified .     with permission to use clomiphene citrate , rodriguez was once again one of the few players allowed to take medicine designed to increase testosterone levels . in 2008 , three major leaguers were granted exemptions to take drugs to treat hypogonadism . in fact , from the 2006 season through 2013 , only 15 were granted for androgen deficiencies and hypogonadism , the conditions that under mlb \u2019 s drug policy could require a medical testosterone boost .     by 2008 , rodriguez had played at least a significant portion of his career -- including , at a minimum , two of this three mvp seasons -- with the apparent help of anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs . he was by far the richest man in mlb , which was finally coming to terms with its steroid problem . rodriguez had a guaranteed contract until the age of 42. the only wise thing to do would be to ride out that contract while continuing to apply for dubious exemptions but staying on the right side of baseball law .     but rodriguez wasn \u2019 t the type for laurel-resting .     *****     the handshake that was both tony bosch \u2019 s biggest break and the beginning of his downfall came late on a sweltering night in tampa . it was july 30 , 2010 , and bosch was flanked by a friend , jorge ( oggi ) velazquez . to the ballplayer they both called cacique , or boss , they could have seemed a comical couple as they walked into his hotel room : velazquez , a short , hard-eyed former liquor-store owner from south florida with an intense temper , bosch a twitchy , ingratiating character everybody called dr. t.     this guy is the best at what he does , velazquez promised rodriguez , laying the salesmanship on thick . he can provide you with everything you need .     if the ballplayer had any misgivings , he didn \u2019 t show it . instead , bosch later said , the first words out of rodriguez \u2019 s mouth were , \u201cwhat were you giving manny ramirez ? \u201d     the inquiry was rooted in both envy and concern . in 2008 , ramirez , who was traded from the red sox to the dodgers during the season , had at age 36 seemed to rejuvenate his health and his swing , playing in all but nine regular-season games and almost doubling his home run output from the previous season , from 20 to 37.     of course , in 2009 ramirez had been nabbed by baseball \u2019 s ped police -- he had been caught taking hcg and served a 50-game suspension . bosch \u2019 s name had surfaced in the investigation : his father , dr. pedro bosch , had written the hcg prescription for ramirez , who did not have a therapeutic-use exemption from mlb .     bosch explained to rodriguez that ramirez had been busted because he hadn \u2019 t followed instructions . getting caught , bosch explained , was just manny being manny . it was \u201cnearly impossible \u201d for bosch \u2019 s clients to test positive if they followed his protocol , he said . he would provide diagnostic blood testing , proper dosing and exact times at which the drugs should be administered .     rodriguez was sold . bosch detailed the testosterone creams , growth hormone and other substances he would be recommending , and they made plans to meet again . soon afterward , the nickname cacique started appearing in bosch \u2019 s notebooks . other times , bosch wrote aer next to his new client \u2019 s phone number . the initials stood , of course , for alexander emmanuel rodriguez .     the 2010 meeting between bosch and rodriguez was one part luck , one part cosmic inevitability and all parts yuri sucart , a cousin of rodriguez \u2019 s who was the slugger \u2019 s frequent companion and unofficial personal assistant . in 2009 or early ' 10 , sucart , who was friends with velazquez , had a weight-loss consultation with bosch . sucart , who had carried around extra pounds since childhood , was nearing obesity in his late 40s . bosch put sucart on a pounds-shedding regimen of supplements and hormones .     sucart doted on , and was employed by , his younger cousin . sure , rodriguez had burned sucart by outing him as his steroid source to investigators and reporters when the slugger admitted in ' 09 to using peds from 2001-03 while with the rangers . that cost sucart access to mlb facilities , but it had also given him a salary bump . sucart , who made under $ 60,000 from rodriguez in 2006 , saw his pay rise to $ 100,000 over the next five years . rodriguez even had the yankees make an extra 2009 championship ring , worth thousands of dollars , for his banned-from-mlb cousin .     during his treatments with bosch , sucart wore yankees hats and shirts and that championship ring . he also told bosch that he worked for rodriguez . among the supplements bosch gave sucart were his signature \u201cgummies , \u201d fast-acting testosterone troches . sucart told bosch that he thought the troches packed an \u201cunbelievable sense of energy recovery. \u201d he added that he had given one to rodriguez and that his cousin \u201cloved it because of its explosive effect , \u201d according to the arbitration decision .     the long-distance flirtation between bosch and rodriguez lasted for months , until the superstar finally decided to take the plunge in late july 2010. after losing much of the ' 09 season to a hip injury , rodriguez had stayed mostly healthy through the first four months of the ' 10 season . his numbers were unremarkable but steady : he had 14 home runs by the all-star break , and against the royals at yankee stadium on july 22 , he swatted his 599th homer . five days shy of his 35th birthday , he was about to become the youngest player to join the 600 club .     when he next came to the plate , the umpire threw the pitcher a specially marked ball to deal to rodriguez . umps would continue to do this until he hit his next home run ; the mark would be used to authenticate the milestone ball . but rodriguez didn \u2019 t homer in that game . in fact , he didn \u2019 t clear the fence through the three games remaining in the home stand .     the yankees left for a seven-game road trip on july 26 , and rodriguez failed to connect during four games in cleveland . for any other hitter , a two-week home run drought would barely register . but what began as a celebratory chase was turning torturous . as sellout crowds followed his every game , rodriguez complained that stadiums of flashing cameras on each swing never let him forget the looming milestone .     even without the power drought , rodriguez might have hooked up with bosch eventually . despite his enormous talent , rodriguez spent his career seeking a synthetic edge , especially when struggling to meet mile-high expectations . taken as a whole , rodriguez \u2019 s greatest baseball achievements were inseparable from his use of peds . now his body was corroding due to age . but all he needed was one more push to knock down those historic milestones and place himself among the all-time greats .     the call came to velazquez in late july , and he relayed the inquiry to bosch : rodriguez wanted to talk about becoming a client . they met at a tampa hotel following a road loss to the rays ; rodriguez , still stuck on 599 , had gone 0-for-4 . sucart , who despite mlb \u2019 s ban had remained rodriguez \u2019 s shadow , joined his cousin , velazquez , and bosch in the hotel room .     the foursome met often . in early august , they gathered again , this time at rodriguez \u2019 s $ 30,000-per-month apartment on central park west , a building that denzel washington and sting also called home . bosch insisted on drawing blood to design an appropriate protocol for rodriguez . he then flew back to miami with rodriguez \u2019 s plasma , knowing the vial contained the opportunity of his career .     bosch consulted with a urologist , according to the arbitration decision . he also had lengthy conversations about rodriguez \u2019 s medical history with sucart . bosch dreamed up an elaborate doping protocol that would take rodriguez into december , built around testosterone , hgh , and growth-hormone-producing peptides . less than a week later , bosch traveled to see rodriguez in new york ; his luggage was packed with preloaded syringes .     on aug. 4 , rodriguez finally connected on a pitch and made a sold-out yankee stadium erupt . home run no . 600 flew into monument park , the museum beyond centerfield honoring yankees greats . as he rounded the bases , rodriguez lifted his palms coyly . his teammates streamed out of the dugout to congratulate him , and he took a curtain call for the roaring crowd .     at that point , fans knew only about rodriguez \u2019 s positive steroid test back in 2003. that was still enough to mark rodriguez forever as a cheater . but this moment was a step toward redemption and leadership in the eyes of the fans and his team . the previous october , he had finally earned a championship ring . now no . 600 was out of the way .     rodriguez wasn \u2019 t on bosch \u2019 s regimen yet . but even as he circled the bases , and after the game as his colleagues were praising him for succeeding without steroids -- \u201cthat \u2019 s a chapter of his life i think he \u2019 s turned the page on , \u201d said hitting coach kevin long -- rodriguez knew he \u2019 d found the man who would help energize the latter stage of his career . he was one week past his 35th birthday , and he was determined to collect every one of those milestone bonuses in his contract . he wanted to be the lone member of the 800 home run club , bosch would later say . to do that would take a nature-defying power surge in his late 30s of the sort barry bonds had pioneered .     on aug. 14 \u2014 -- even days after his down-to-the-minute regimen with bosch began -- rodriguez slammed three home runs in kansas city . afterward , he admitted for the first time that his lagging power production had bothered him . \u201ci haven \u2019 t really hit for any power this year , so it \u2019 s been frustrating , \u201d he said . \u201cbeing stuck at 599 was really a microcosm of what \u2019 s happened all year . i \u2019 ve been able to drive in runs and hit some doubles here and there , but overall i \u2019 ve hit for no power. \u201d     but now , tony bosch had a believer .     to purchase a copy of blood sport , go here .\n"}], "hannah": [{"url": "file://val/41/0/0", "title": "val/41/0/0", "content": "starting

and committee staff have had extensive dialogue on this issue , and the agency is prepared to work with the committee to determine the best way forward on potential declassification , \u201d he said .     advertisement continue reading the main story     senator dianne feinstein , the california democrat who is the intelligence committee \u2019 s chairwoman , said recently that her committee would soon vote to adopt the report \u2019 s executive summary and conclusion , which would then be subject to a formal declassification process before it was publicly released .     republican members of the committee , angry about what they see as a biased and shoddy investigation by their democratic colleagues , are planning to make public a rebuttal of their own .     the senate report , which took years to complete and cost more than $ 40 million to produce , began as an attempt to document what was perhaps the most divisive of the bush administration \u2019 s responses to the sept. 11 attacks . but it has since become enmeshed in the complex politics of the obama administration .     advertisement continue reading the main story     president obama ended the detention program as one of his

our basic values by using torture to interrogate our enemies , and detaining individuals in a way that ran counter to the rule of law. \u201d     newsletter sign up continue reading the main story

repeatedly resisted demands by human rights groups to seek prosecutions for the lawyers who approved the interrogation methods or the people who carried them out , and the white house has been mostly silent during the debate over the past year about declassifying the senate report .     advertisement continue reading the main story     for all his criticisms of the counterterrorism excesses during the bush administration , mr. obama has put the c.i.a . at the center of his strategy to kill militant suspects in pakistan , yemen and elsewhere .     human rights groups have tried to pressure the white house to intervene to get the senate report declassified .     advertisement continue reading the main story     \u201cwhether it \u2019 s stalling or concealing , the c.i.a . is trying to avoid reckoning with its past abuse , \u201d said naureen shah of amnesty international usa . \u201cand that \u2019 s what makes declassifying the senate \u2019 s report so crucial right now. \u201d     ms. krass is a career government lawyer who works at the justice department \u2019 s office of legal counsel , the arm of the department that advises the white house on the legality of domestic and foreign policies .     advertisement continue reading the main story     the office was particularly controversial during the bush administration , when lawyers there wrote lengthy memos approving c.i.a . interrogation methods like waterboarding and sleep deprivation , as well as signing off on the expansion of surveillance by the national security agency .     under mr. obama , the office has approved other controversial practices , including the killing of anwar al-awlaki , a radical cleric living in yemen who was an american . mr. awlaki was killed in september 2011 by a c.i.a . drone strike , launched from a secret base in saudi arabia .     advertisement continue reading the main story     much of tuesday \u2019 s hearing was consumed by a debate about whether the white house should be forced to share justice department legal memos .     advertisement continue reading the main story     under polite but persistent questioning by members of both parties , ms. krass repeatedly said that while the two congressional intelligence committees need to \u201cfully understand \u201d the legal basis for c.i.a . activities , they were not entitled to see the justice department memos that provide the legal blueprint for secret programs .     the opinions \u201crepresent pre-decisional , confidential legal advice that has been provided , \u201d she said , adding that the confidentiality of the legal advice was necessary to allow a \u201cfull and frank discussion amongst clients and policy makers and their lawyers within the executive branch. \u201d     senator feinstein appeared unmoved . \u201cunless we know the administration \u2019 s basis for sanctioning a program , it is very hard to oversee it , \u201d she said .     advertisement continue

obama ' s nominee to be general counsel of the central intelligence agency indicated at her confirmation hearing tuesday that she opposes giving members of congress access to justice department legal memoranda that govern cia activities such as interrogation and drone strikes .     the nominee who rebuffed senate intelligence committee chairwoman dianne feinstein , caroline krass , has served as a top lawyer in the justice department office of legal counsel and at times as the acting director of that office .     feinstein opened her questioning of krass by asking her if she would commit to sharing olc opinions with the senate panel .     \" this isn ' t just idle curiousity . it is really to understand the direction and rules under which certain programs operate , \" feinstein said . \" we have found that these opinions are actually indispensable to effective oversight . \" she said that an inspector general report found the cia waterboarded 9/11 suspect khalid sheikh mohammed in a manner inconsistent with the olc opinion on waterboarding .     krass responded initially by saying she was committed to making sure senators on the panel understood the legal framework cia is working in , but she stopped short of committing to share the written opinions .     \" i do believe the committee needs to fully udnerstand the legal basis for any activities , intelligence acitvities , in which the cia is engaged , including covert action , \" krass said .     feinstein was unsatisfied and pressed krass for a \" yes or no \" answer on access to the opinions . what the senator got sounded pretty much like a \" no . \"     \" the olc opinions represent predecisional , confidential legal advice that \u2019 s been provided . protecting confidentiality of that legal advice preserves space for their to be a full and frank discussion among clients , policymakers and their lawyers within the executive branch and really furthers the rule of law and allows for effective functioning of the executive branch , \" krass said , repeating her offer to help the committee understand the administration ' s legal thinking and saying she has \" an almost unique ability to do that . \"     \" i think we do understand it , \" feinstein replied . \" i think it has been explained to us but every olc opinion has been a fight to obtain and we have obtained very few of them , only those that relate to u.s . citizens . \"     feinstein didn ' t immediate explain what she meant , but she may have been referring to a battle the committee had earlier this year to get opinions on targeting terrorism suspects for deadly force in drone attacks . the confirmation of cia director john brennan was held up for a time until president barack obama agreed to share legal memos on the subject with congressional committees .     joining feinstein , sen. susan collins ( r-maine ) said she was \" troubled \" by krass ' s answer . collins noted that the office of legal counsel often releases unclassified opinions .     \" they go through an extensive review process .... we try to publish opinions when we can to promote transparency , \" krass said , before saying there would be some merit to considering that for classified legal opinions . \" i do think it ' s worth exploring whether there could be some kind of similar process with respect to classified olc opinions . \"     pressed by sen. carl levin ( d-mich. ) , krass said she does not believe congress has a right to office of legal counsel opinions .     \" i do not think so , as a general matter , \" she said .     last month , the justice department pressed a federal appeals court to preserve the office of legal counsel ' s ability to keep legal opinions from the public .     collins also raised a 2011 episode in which obama rejected a legal interpretation advanced by krass and the pentagon ' s top lawyer at the time , jeh johnson , which would have curtailed u.s. operations in libya . obama sided with his white house counsel and state department lawyers in deciding to continue the operation .     in an indirect way , collins suggested krass might have quit if she thought what the president proposed doing was illegal .     \" what i don ' t like seeing is the administration shopping around until it gets a legal opinion with which it agrees and that seems to have happened in the case of libya , \" collins said .     update ( tuesday , 4 : 05 p.m. ) : this post has been updated with the exchange with levin .     read more about : transparency , justice department , senate intelligence committee
