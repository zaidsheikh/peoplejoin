( 1 ) \" indeed , \" said investigator joukje van rijswijk from the vu university medical center amsterdam , \" it even tends to the opposite . \"     behind her conclusions lies a large randomised comparative study in which 479 patients with standard indications for iui ( unexplained or mild male factor infertility ) were randomly assigned to 15 minutes of immobilisation immediately after insemination or to immediate mobilisation . with most patients having several cycles of iui in their treatment course , the comparison was based on a total of 950 cycles of immobilisation and 984 cycles of mobilisation .     results showed that the cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate per couple ( that is , after the total course of treatment , which in some cases ran to six cycles ) was comparable between the two groups - a pregnancy rate of 32.2 % after 15 minutes of immobilisation and 40.3 % after immediate mobilisation . these differences were not statistically significant , despite the trend , indicating no benefit from a brief period of bed rest after insemination . \" in our opinion , \" said dr van rijswijk , \" immobilisation after iui has no positive effect on pregnancy rates , and there is no reason why patients should stay immobilised after treatment . \"     she acknowledged that these results were \" in disagreement with the literature \" , from which a widespread acceptance of bed rest after iui had evolved . a smaller study published last year from the middle east found that ten and 15 minutes of immobilisation following iui ( compared to five minutes ) had a beneficial effect on pregnancy rates . however , the results were based on just one cycle of treatment and not on the more real-world context of multiple cycles . another smaller dutch study published in 2009 also found that 15 minutes bed rest improved pregnancy rate and \" should be offered to all women treated with intrauterine insemination \" . ( 2 )     \" it was these previous studies showing a benefit of bed rest which prompted us to perform this study , \" said dr van rijswijk . \" our goal was to replicate the results . there ' s always a possibility that a positive outcome in studies is the result of chance . we also know from other studies that sperm cells can reach the fallopian tube five minutes after intravaginal insemination and that they can survive for several days in the womb . why should bed rest affect that ? there ' s no biological explanation for a positive effect of immobilisation \" , which , she added , is usually carried out in a supine position with the knees raised .     \" we believe our results in such a large randomised trial are solid , and sufficiently strong to render the recommendation for bed rest obsolete , \" she said .     asked if bed rest might also be of no help in natural conception plans , dr van rijswijk said the two insemination techniques are just too different to generalise , and she pointed out that as far as she is aware there have been no randomised trials to test the efficacy of a short period of immobility after the attempt .     ###     abstract o-165 , tuesday 5 july 2016 , 15.30     should patients be immobilised after intrauterine insemination ? a randomised controlled comparison between 15 minutes of immobilisation and direct mobilisation     notes     1. intrauterine insemination ( iui ) is a very common fertility treatment in which a sample of sperm cells ( from donor or partner ) in fluid are injected directly into the uterus . today , most recipients of the treatment are given some ovarian stimulation to encourage follicle growth . iui is usually offered as first-line fertility treatment before ivf in couples whose infertility is unexplained ( idiopathic ) or caused by mild male factors which may not require icsi . several factors are related to pregnancy outcomes , but so far now no consensus exists on whether immobilisation is of benefit .     2. custers im , flierman pa , maas p , et al . immobilisation versus immediate mobilisation after intrauterine insemination : randomised controlled trial . bmj 2009 ; 339 : b4080 .
