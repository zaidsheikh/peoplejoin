that would flower with the rise of ronald reagan .\n"}, {"url": "file://val/53/0/2", "title": "val/53/0/2", "content": "washington ( reuters ) - phyllis schlafly , who became a \u201cfounding mother \u201d of the modern u.s. conservative movement by battling feminists in the 1970s and working tirelessly to defeat the equal rights amendment , died on monday at the age of 92 , her eagle forum group said .     conservative activist phyllis schlafly introduces u.s. republican presidential candidate donald trump at the peabody opera house in st. louis , missouri , march 11 , 2016. reuters/aaron p. bernstein - rtsaf6q     schlafly , who lived in the st. louis suburb of ladue , missouri , died at her home in the presence of her family , eagle forum said in a statement . the cause of death was not given .     she was still a conservative force and popular speaker in her 90s , endorsing donald trump for the republican presidential nomination in 2016 and praising his policy on immigration . she was a delegate to the republicans \u2019 convention in cleveland .     trump said in a statement that he spoke with schlafly a few weeks ago by telephone \u201cand she sounded as resilient as ever ... she was a patriot , a champion for women , and a symbol of strength. \u201d     schlafly once called feminists \u201ca bunch of bitter women seeking a constitutional cure for their personal problems , \u201d time said , while insisting that \u201cwomen find their greatest fulfillment at home with their family. \u201d     her political ardor did not fade with age and in 2014 , as president barack obama pushed for pay equity for women , schlafly sparked controversy with a column for the christian post saying a man \u2019 s paycheck comes first .     \u201cthe pay gap between men and women is not all bad because it helps to promote and sustain marriages , \u201d she said . \u201c ... the best way to improve economic prospects for women is to improve job prospects for the men in their lives , even if that means increasing the so-called pay gap. \u201d     schlafly promoted traditional family values and once told a reporter that she always listed her occupation as \u201cmother \u201d when filling out applications . but she was hardly a typical stay-at-home housewife/mother .     shortly after marrying lawyer fred schlafly in 1949 , she became active in republican party politics in alton , illinois , and ran unsuccessfully for congress twice . she would go on to found the eagle forum grass-roots conservative group , write a newspaper column and newsletter and author some 20 books .     her crowning achievement was crusading to prevent the equal rights amendment from being added to the u.s. constitution and it made schlafly a leader in the modern american conservative movement .     \u201cphyllis schlafly courageously and single-handedly took on the issue of the equal rights amendment when no one else in the country was opposing it , \u201d said james c. dobson , chairman and founder of focus on the family . \u201cin so doing , she essentially launched the pro-family , pro-life movement. \u201d     biographer donald t. critchlow said defeating the era helped usher in a conservative era in american politics and boosted ronald reagan to the presidency .     in her decade-long fight against the era , schlafly traveled across the country to speak at rallies and persuade state legislators not to approve the era .     along the way she often debated feminist writer betty freidan , who called schlafly \u201ca traitor to her sex \u201d and once told her : \u201ci \u2019 d like to burn you at the stake. \u201d     the intention of the era was to ensure women were treated the same as men under state and federal laws . schlafly \u2019 s attack on the proposed amendment was based on the premise that the rights of women already were well protected by the u.s. constitution . she said the era actually would erode women \u2019 s standing , leading to homosexual marriages , women in combat , government-funded abortions and loss of alimony .     in 1972 she started the eagle forum , now located in clayton , missouri , along with stop era , bringing in legions of supporters who had been regarded as non-political housewives . in a 1978 appearance at the illinois capitol she was accompanied by backers bearing loaves of home-made bread .     described by time magazine as \u201cfeminine but forceful \u201d and with her hair always carefully styled , schlafly said she attended 41 state hearings to testify against the equal rights amendment . when the era \u2019 s ratification deadline expired in 1982 , having been approved by only 35 of the 38 states needed , schlafly threw a party in washington .     phyllis stewart was born aug. 15 , 1924 , in st. louis and grew up in a home she described as republican but not activist . she put herself through washington university by firing weapons as an ammunition factory tester and later earned a master \u2019 s degree in political science from radcliffe . in 1978 she graduated from washington university \u2019 s law school .     the left attacked schlafly for promoting domestic life to her supporters while spending so much time pursuing her ambitious political agenda . she responded by saying she never told women they should not work .     \u201ci simply didn \u2019 t believe we needed a constitutional amendment to protect women \u2019 s rights , \u201d schlafly told the new york times .     schlafly first became a political presence with her 1964 self-published book \u201ca choice , not an echo , \u201d which championed the conservative politics of arizona senator barry goldwater .     schlafly also built a reputation as a strident anti-communist and opponent of arms control treaties . after the era \u2019 s defeat , she continued to preach conservative causes such as limited government , anti-abortion laws , traditional education , strong defense and keeping out illegal immigrants .     related coverage factbox : facts about conservative activist phyllis schlafly     she frequently criticized immigration reform and the obama administration and wrote more than 25 books .     schlafly also was a critic of gay rights , which proved to be a sensitive topic in 1992 when the oldest of her six children , john , who worked for the eagle forum , acknowledged he was homosexual .     schlafly \u2019 s husband fred died in 1993. she is survived by six children , 16 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren , eagle forum said .\n"}, {"url": "file://val/53/2/0",
