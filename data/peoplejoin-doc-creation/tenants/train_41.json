closest friends , banished from his inner circle , have grown increasingly concerned . they worry that the pop-culture icon is being held against his will inside his hollywood hills mansion \u2014 with one suggesting more sinister notions are at play .     by saturday , march 12 , 2016 richard simmons opened his front door , frail and trembling . mauro oliveira , a visual artist who was also simmons \u2019 masseur and former assistant , greeted him on the front porch , concerned about his friend . after receiving an ominous phone call from simmons , oliveira had driven his truck to the hollywood hills , past the two metal gates that simmons had left ajar for him , and into the driveway . he reached the porch through the white columns that recalled an antebellum southern mansion , and past simmons \u2019 bronze statue of a regal dalmatian . wearing a t-shirt and sweatpants , a gaunt simmons led oliveira through the foyer , and into the living room . \u201cmauro , we can no longer see each other , \u201d simmons told him in a quiet , defeated voice . evan hurd/sygma/corbis it was april 2014. oliveira , a 49-year-old from brazil with the burly arms and trim physique of a gym rat and close-cropped black hair , had met simmons 13 months earlier , and the two became fast friends . but he was catching a weird vibe lately , and hadn \u2019 t seen him in a while , before the then 65-year-old simmons summoned him to the mansion , saying only that they needed to talk . \u201cwhat \u2019 s going on , richard ? \u201d oliveira asked . \u201cwhy are you saying that ? \u201d \u201ci don \u2019 t know , \u201d simmons replied . \u201ci just want to be by myself , and i want to be in the house , and we \u2019 re never going to see each other again. \u201d simmons \u2019 home is a mixture of classical architecture and design that recalls his new orleans youth . he collects offbeat pieces , including a menagerie of dolls highlighted by a rare barbra streisand model and the colorful work of mexican painter and sculptor sergio bustamante . as they spoke , he and oliveira stood near an ornate grand piano . \u201clet \u2019 s talk it over , \u201d oliveira said . \u201ci want to sit here , and make sure you \u2019 ll be ok. let \u2019 s go upstairs , i \u2019 ll give you a massage and relax you. \u201d simmons called up to teresa reveles , his live-in housekeeper of nearly three decades . \u201cmauro is going upstairs with me , \u201d he said . \u201cno , no , no ! \u201d reveles shouted from the second floor , according to oliveira . \u201cget out ! get out ! \u201d oliveira looked at his friend , who told him in a soft voice , \u201cyou \u2019 ve gotta go. \u201d oliveira leaned in toward simmons . \u201cis she controlling your life now ? \u201d as oliveira tells it , simmons looked down , and with one resigned word confirmed his worst suspicions : \u201cyes. \u201d this was the last time he saw his friend . with reveles shrieking behind him , oliveira hustled out to his truck , picked up his cell phone , and asked an intermediary to contact simmons \u2019 older brother , lenny . he and lenny did not have a close relationship , but oliveira knew of nowhere else to turn . oliveira is calm as he recounts this story , but irritation enters his voice as he recalls a threat leveled that day , nearly two years ago . \u201clater that evening , richard called me and said that his manager and teresa wanted to put a restraining order against me \u2014 you can see how controlling they are \u2014 and i said , \u2018what restraining order ? you are the one who called me . i \u2019 m not invading your privacy , or your house. \u2019 that was the end of that . no restraining order was put against me. \u201d oliveira has spoken briefly about his privileged access to simmons during this dark period , but never in this much detail . he recently underwent a heart procedure , which he blames on simmons-related stress , and is reluctant to invite further strain . but he agreed to elaborate on a hollywood mystery that has previously been told only in a few cryptic tabloid items . \u201cwe are very concerned . i believe that something else is happening . i don \u2019 t think richard is in there of his own volition. \u201d richard simmons has vanished from public view , and many who know him best say they haven \u2019 t had any contact in more than two years . all repeat the same message , some anonymously and some on the record : simmons stopped returning calls and emails more than two years ago , behavior that is highly out of character , and his housekeeper is blocking access to him at home . indeed , for a generous and intensely social public figure , one who taught classes at his beverly hills gym until a few years ago ; has sold more than 20 million exercise videos , including the mega-popular \u201csweatin \u2019 to the oldies \u201d series ; appeared many times on david letterman \u2019 s shows , \u201cgeneral hospital , \u201d his own talk show and infomercials ; and was a seemingly ubiquitous presence for decades , the silence is striking . getty \u201cwe were very close , \u201d says a friend in hollywood who spoke on the condition that his name be withheld , and who has not heard back from simmons since 2013 \u2014 one of five people who described to me the same situation . \u201cit \u2019 s not something that i want to seek publicity about , but we are very concerned . teresa did turn me away several times . he has missed funerals of close friends . he was the most reliable and caring person on the planet , and then to suddenly vanish ? i have come to believe that something else is happening . i don \u2019 t think richard is in there of his own volition. \u201d it \u2019 s a sentiment that oliveira takes even further . \u201ci feel that richard is now being controlled by the very people that he controlled his whole life , \u201d he says . \u201ccontrolled in the sense that they are taking advantage of his weak mental state . controlled in the sense that they are controlling his mail , controlling his everything . his brother , the manager and teresa . those three people. \u201d he also believes that simmons is deeply depressed , because of a chronic knee injury that has kept him from teaching classes ; the death of his beloved 17-year-old dalmatian , hattie ; and exhaustion from a lifetime as one of the highest-octane characters in american pop culture . how does he think simmons has spent his days since cutting off contact with the world ? \u201cmedicated and in bed , \u201d oliveira says . michael catalano , simmons \u2019 longtime manager , insists that all the worry is misplaced . \u201crichard is enjoying life at home after a 40-year career of traveling the world and inspiring people to take better care of themselves , \u201d catalano told me ( he declined my request for an interview with simmons ) . \u201che is working on several projects and continues to encourage those that need his help. \u201d \u201cif richard never comes out of the shadows and says he is ok , then no one will ever know the truth . his fans will just wake up one day and see the horrible story that he passed away. \u201d teresa reveles did not respond to phone and email messages , and the gates were locked during my several visits to simmons \u2019 home . but catalano pushes back strongly against the idea that the housekeeper , or anyone else , is controlling the fitness guru . \u201ci can tell you absolutely 100 % that is not the case , \u201d he told me . \u201cif richard wants to get in his car and drive to starbucks , no one is telling him he can \u2019 t . in response to \u2018the housekeeper is keeping him captive , \u2019 i can tell you that it is 100 % not true . it \u2019 s ridiculous . richard has always been someone who makes up his own mind what he wants to do. \u201d until they see him , however , many friends will remain highly skeptical . \u201cif richard never comes out of the shadows and says he is ok , then no one will ever know the truth , \u201d says one . \u201chis fans will just wake up one day and see the horrible story that he passed away. \u201d oliveira presents the most solid evidence of simmons \u2019 mental and emotional state , because his access to the mansion was more recent than others \u2019 . but even he has been left with a dearth of concrete , up-to-date information , leaving friends to concoct theories , some more outlandish than others . \u201ci think tormented is the best word to describe his mental state , \u201d oliveira says . \u201ci think it was ( caused by ) black magic , witchcraft . that \u2019 s not close to your culture , but to my culture in brazil , and to mexicans \u201d \u2014 teresa reveles is from mexico \u2014 \u201cthat is a real thing . they invoke the spirits . they light black candles , and red and blue candles . i \u2019 ve never participated . i only saw from a distance . but at services , they do special meals . they offer meals to the bad spirits , and light candles , invoking with words. \u201d it is a bizarre allegation , but one not totally out of place in the story of this extraordinary american life . andy martino         simmons \u2019 tale , defined by depression , resilience and reinvention , began on july 12 , 1948 , in that city of muggy mysticism , new orleans . milton teagle simmons \u2014 he later changed the name to honor a beloved uncle \u2014 was the second of two boys born to leonard and shirley simmons . theirs was a complicated family , crammed into a shotgun house in the french quarter . both parents were entertainers from the vaudeville era , having worked as singers , dancers , actors , and masters of ceremony . shirley found more success than leonard , so when richard and his older brother , lenny , were young , their parents made a decision unusual for the time : shirley would continue to tour , and leonard would be a stay-at-home parent . as shirley packed for her trips , young richard would cry and plead with his mother , \u201cwhy do you have to go ? why do you have to go ? \u201d leonard , annoyed , would respond by freezing richard out of the family for periods of time ; richard would fire back by mocking his dad for not having a job . \u201chis method of punishment was perfect , \u201d simmons wrote in his engaging 1999 memoir , \u201cstill hungry \u2014 after all these years. \u201d \u201cit was the punishment of silence . very effective for a child who craves attention . you didn \u2019 t exist . he didn \u2019 t do your laundry , he didn \u2019 t set a place at the table for you \u2014 milton doesn \u2019 t live here anymore. \u201d leonard and shirley kept separate bedrooms and argued often , especially when she returned from the road . once when richard was 4 or 5 years old , he peered into the kitchen , to see his mother doubled over the sink , clutching her stomach . she had an ulcer , which leonard blamed on his high-maintenance youngest son .     \u201care you happy now ? \u201d he said to richard , as recounted in the memoir . \u201csee what you have done ? you made your mother sick . you gave her a peptic ulcer . it \u2019 s all your fault. \u201d more than 30 years later , when simmons was showing off his first house in the hollywood hills , his father still withheld attention and approval . \u201cthere \u2019 s too many windows and too much glass , \u201d leonard told his son , who by now was a successful workout guru with a recurring role on \u201cgeneral hospital. \u201d \u201cit \u2019 s going to be very drafty . and where is the nearest grocery store , fish market , bakery ? you \u2019 re going to have to drive all the way down the side of this mountain . this just doesn \u2019 t make sense ! \u201d \u201cnothing i did , \u201d simmons wrote , \u201cseemed to be right. \u201d people close to simmons say that wounds from the fraught father-son dynamic have always been raw , even though both parents are long dead . \u201cnow he has a complicated relationship with his brother , \u201d one friend says . \u201che loves him , but ( he ) always says that his father favored lenny. \u201d when i tried to reach lenny simmons , a woman , presumably lenny \u2019 s wife kathy , picked up the phone , and had no interest in chatting . \u201chi , \u201d i began . \u201ci \u2019 m a writer working on a piece about richard simmons \u2014 \u201d \u201cwe have no comment , \u201d the woman said . \u201ci haven \u2019 t asked a question yet. \u201d \u201ci said we have no comment. \u201d click . courtesy of mauro oliveira friends say that family history has always weighed on simmons . \u201che sometimes will slip into the persona of a 5-year-old child , \u201d says one pal who claims to have seen this within the past few years . \u201che \u2019 ll play with dolls , and call you daddy . it \u2019 s \u2018daddy this \u2019 and \u2018daddy that. \u2019 \u201d simmons \u2019 relationship with his father was far from his only source of childhood trauma . from an early age , he struggled with his weight , and addiction to food . leonard cooked elaborate meals , and taught his son how to do the same ; the kitchen was one of the only places where their tension cooled . but by the time he was in grammar school , simmons was heavier than his peers . his parents took him to doctors \u2014 \u201cyou \u2019 re a big fella , \u201d one joked , a comment that simmons never forgot \u2014 put him on diets , did whatever they could . before even reaching high school , simmons experimented with diet pills ; as a young adult , he would starve himself , take laxatives , binge and purge , and otherwise try to escape the torture of hating his body . the other kids hardly made it easier , alternating between taunts about his weight and his effeminate manner , which brought on the label of \u201csissy , \u201d as simmons recalls in his memoir . once , in the sixth grade , simmons had just walked out of the schoolyard when a boy named moose called to him , \u201chey , porker. \u201d before simmons could turn around , he felt the crack of a baseball bat on the back of his head . \u201cmaybe i can put a hole in your head and some of that fat will come out , \u201d moose said . \u201chey , porker , \u201d one schoolyard bully taunted simmons . \u201cmaybe i can put a hole in your head and some of that fat will come out. \u201d for simmons , these experiences brought out the ability to empathize with singular intensity , the skill that would later bring him success and fame . while in high school , simmons began accompanying the mother of a friend , named barbara , to weight watchers meetings . at those weekly gatherings , women stepped on a scale ; if they had gained any weight , the leader would pin a pig on their clothing . deep into middle age , simmons still recalled watching barbara receive a pig . \u201ci \u2019 ll never forget the look of shame on her face , \u201d he wrote . \u201chere was this happy lady , and one trip to the scale and 20 minutes later , her mascara is running down her cheeks , and she has a pig on her shoulder. \u2026 i felt a need to give her a pep talk , and try to make her feel better about herself again. \u201d for a time in college , simmons lived and studied in florence , hoping to become a serious painter in the tradition of gustav klimt . one day , a casting agent for the legendary director federico fellini approached him , needing an obese extra for the film \u201csatyricon. \u201d simmons parlayed that appearance into a string of italian commercials , and achieved minor local celebrity . but those roles required him to stay overweight ; he was 5-foot-7 , and had ballooned to more than 250 pounds . simmons eventually moved back to the u.s. , hoping to get healthier . his interest in becoming a painter faded , as the desire to escape fat and self-loathing persisted . having cycled through every imaginable way to control his eating , simmons became passionate about exercise in the early 1970s , while working as a waiter in los angeles . his outgoing personality in that job attracted attention , and helped him to meet investors interested in his idea of starting a combined salad bar and gym , called the ruffage and anatomy asylum . he opened his business in 1974 , soon dropped the food-service aspect , and renamed the space slimmons studio . it launched what quickly became an exercise empire and still stands today on what is now city center drive in beverly hills . the location , and simmons \u2019 sociability , helped him forge connections in hollywood , which led to tv appearances , videos , a talk show , radio , infomercials and game shows . once his fame exploded , simmons \u2019 contribution to the culture transcended \u201csweatin \u2019 to the oldies. \u201d decades before \u201cwill and grace \u201d helped make middle america more comfortable with gay culture , simmons \u2014 while never technically out to the public \u2014 pushed traditional boundaries of manliness and gender , all while helping others . rhonda garelick , a professor of comparative literature at princeton , has studied and written about simmons \u2019 impact . \u201cby inserting himself so dramatically into popular culture , and befriending and working to help overweight women \u2014 another group often ostracized or shamed \u2014 simmons did make progress i think for the general acceptance of gay people , \u201d garelick told me in an email . simmons taught classes at his gym until about two years ago , but hasn \u2019 t been seen there since . dropping by slimmons is an experience akin to calling lenny simmons \u2019 house . when i knocked on the door on a recent morning , a woman in exercise clothes opened it a crack . \u201csorry , we don \u2019 t allow reporters in here , \u201d she said , before shutting it in my face . courtesy of mauro oliveira         betty wilson is an advocate in los angeles for people with disabilities , and now the commissioner of the california commission on disability access , located in downtown l.a. she has also been a friend of simmons for more than 20 years \u2014 until , that is , late 2013 . \u201ci \u2019 m concerned because it is not like him to not respond to me , \u201d wilson tells me over lunch in santa monica . \u201ci mean , personally respond . i have sent many emails . no response. \u201d a few years ago , simmons expressed interest in developing exercise programs for the disabled . wilson saw this as a natural extension of his empathy and desire to help marginalized people . \u201cit shows his humanity , \u201d wilson says . \u201che wanted to be inclusive , before that word was even being used. \u201d the two were in regular contact about this project , until just over two years ago , when simmons \u2019 responses abruptly stopped . now , she joins the chorus of worried and suspicious friends . wilson and simmons have a mutual friend , june park , who operates the store wigs today in a strip mall at third and fairfax in los angeles . for years , simmons made frequent visits to the shop , to chat with park and browse the merchandise ( at home , friends say , simmons sometimes wears wigs including a blonde bob and a brown , shoulder-length model ) . the two began to socialize , with group dinners and nights on the town . but like many others , park has been unable to reach simmons for about two years . \u201che \u2019 s a wonderful , wonderful guy , \u201d says park , 62 . \u201che \u2019 s such a sweet guy . he tries to help everybody . he brings people in here and buys them wigs . sometimes he would look at people , and read their aura , and start crying . that \u2019 s real . that \u2019 s true. \u201d park last tried to visit simmons on july 12 , 2014 , his 66th birthday . she brought flowers . teresa reveles answered the door . \u201che started humiliating me in front of everybody . it \u2019 s hard to explain how someone is when they \u2019 re tormented by a bad force . that \u2019 s the thing . teresa is putting black magic on him. \u201d \u201ci want to see richard , \u201d park recalls saying . \u201cshe said , \u2018he doesn \u2019 t want to see anybody right now. \u2019 i don \u2019 t believe it . he \u2019 s not ok. \u2026 after that , i can \u2019 t go anymore . i tried to call richard a couple times . no one will call me back . it is a really sad story . i \u2019 m so sad right now . everybody loves him. \u201d standing in her store , surrounded by wigs , park \u2019 s penetrating gaze fixes on mine and she implores me to spread the word about her concerns , \u201cas soon as possible , please. \u201d oliveira \u2019 s version of simmons \u2019 descent into what he calls \u201cself-imprisonment \u201d is the most viable theory to which friends in the dark can cling . simmons and oliveira first met in a hollywood art gallery in march 2013 , when oliveira was showing his paintings . they quickly connected , and the versatile oliveira started working for simmons , first as a masseuse , and then as a personal assistant . he insists that he and simmons were just friends , and never romantically involved . that may , oliveira says , simmons offered to buy him a birthday present , saying it could be big . oliveira responded by telling him how , from the age of 6 to 18 , he had lived in an orphanage called hope unlimited in campinas , brazil , and had recently learned that the place needed a new well for its water . it would cost $ 30,000 . could simmons do that ? simmons said that he would be glad to help . in august he , oliveira and catalano traveled to brazil for the opening of the well . oliveira remembers the day as beautiful and moving , with children singing to simmons . but the trip itself brought about new tensions between the two . \u201cwhen he woke up at the hotel , he was already tormented , \u201d oliveira says . \u201ci went into his room and said , \u2018richard , are you ready? \u2019 and he already started being bipolar : \u2018don \u2019 t rush me ! \u2019 i had just asked in a nice way . then , as we were driving from sao paulo to campinas , he started humiliating me in front of the driver , in front of everybody , in front of michael . just being a tormented person . it \u2019 s extremely hard to explain to you how someone is when they are tormented by a bad force . that \u2019 s the thing . fucking teresa is putting black magic on him . like i put in the book. \u201d ah , the book . the tome to which oliveira refers is \u201cking rich and the evil witch , \u201d a self-published e-book in which oliveira presents his version of the people and events in simmons \u2019 inner circle . in the book , labeled a \u201cliving fairy tale , \u201d simmons is \u201cthe good goofy king rich , \u201d teresa reveles is \u201cevil witch boreza , \u201d lenny simmons is \u201cprince benny \u201d and michael catalano is \u201cmorono. \u201d oliveira calls the character based on himself \u201cthe artist. \u201d he hopes to adapt the tale into a broadway play .     mauro oliveira via amazon     \u201con a christmas early hours , the author had a dream in new york city that he was in a fairy tale with the guru and the witch , \u201d oliveira writes in his introduction . \u201cafter his dream \u2026 the author strongly felt the responsibility to share his true story with the world , and help his friend , \u2018the king. \u2019 \u201d in the story , the young prince rich develops a \u201cbrilliant life plan to help the large obese population in the kingdom and beyond , \u201d and becomes successful in the \u201ckingdom of la la land. \u201d realizing that he needs help maintaining his castle , he places an ad in the \u201cla la land times , \u201d soliciting a servant . witch boreza answers it and immediately \u201chas her eye on the big prize : to inherit the castle and all of the prince \u2019 s fortune and possessions. \u201d after many years , the now-king rich meets the artist , arousing jealousy in witch boreza and others in his court . the friends travel to help an orphanage , and later to europe , both based on real life experiences . tensions ensue , resulting in a dramatic \u2014 and admittedly fictional \u2014 climax , where king rich realizes that he has been put under the witch \u2019 s spell , and breaks free of it . \u201cboreza , you fucking witch , \u201d king rich shouts . \u201cyou are now expelled from the la la land kingdom . you have the choice to fly away on your broom now , from the castle \u2019 s balcony , or i am going to order the guards to give you to the thousands of commoners waiting outside. \u201d reality has brought no such catharsis . teresa reveles continues to work for simmons , and remains an object of suspicion to those cast from his circle . june park has read \u201cking rich and the evil witch , \u201d and says , \u201c( oliveira ) did a wonderful job . everything he said was true. \u201d     oliveira admits that some in simmons \u2019 camp were concerned that it was he who was after the boss \u2019 s money . in october of 2013 , he began living in an apartment that simmons purchased , which made the others uncomfortable . oliveira said that he sent a monthly rent check of $ 2,000 , which simmons never cashed . in 2015 , long after he last saw his friend , he contacted simmons \u2019 accountant and asked for an unspecified amount . oliveira claims that simmons had told him to ask for money whenever he needed it , and when he did so , he only asked once , and received nothing . \u201cthe good side of richard felt compelled by my story that i was raised in an orphanage , and was living in a bad neighborhood at the time , \u201d oliveira says . \u201cso he offered ( the apartment ) , and i accepted . he didn \u2019 t put it in my name . it was just an investment for him. \u201d in november 2013 , as simmons \u2019 depression seemed to worsen , he suggested a trip to europe with oliveira , catalano , simmons \u2019 accountant , and lenny and kathy simmons . oliveira , not wanting a repeat of the brazil experience , declined , but simmons kept pushing . finally , oliveira agreed to go . \u201ci said , \u2018richard , you need to get up . you need to do something. \u2019 he replied , \u2018no i \u2019 m tired , let me sleep. \u2019 i walked downstairs and said , \u2018teresa , richard needs treatment. \u2019 she said , \u2018i don \u2019 t care. \u2019 \u201d the group made it through its first two stops , france and england , without incident , but a darker energy materialized in venice . on the final day of their trip , simmons emerged in the hotel lobby dressed in a purple wig , fur coat and earrings , wearing heavy purple lipstick and rouge . it was not unusual for him to don women \u2019 s apparel , but this outfit appeared extreme , and oliveira sensed trouble brewing . that day , the group rented a gondola large enough to fit six people . according to oliveira , when kathy simmons tried to step onto the boat , it tipped , and water rushed in . the gondolier started screaming at her . \u201cthen i said , \u2018listen , you don \u2019 t talk to tourists like this . we are paying you , \u2019 \u201d oliveira says . \u201crichard turned to me , and started screaming at me , ( saying ) that i was a nobody , that i wasn \u2019 t an accomplished artist . i don \u2019 t know if he was looking for an opportunity or a reason . ( then ) he started singing opera . he was completely \u2026 \u201d oliveira trails off , searching for the right words , before picking up the story . \u201cwhen a bad spirit gets in your body \u2014 he was possessed by a bad spirit . my blood pressure was through the roof , and i suspect that i had a minor heart attack . that \u2019 s the reason why i ( later ) had to put a valve on my heart. \u201d cnn after the boat ride \u2014 \u201cthe longest half hour i \u2019 ve ever had in my life , \u201d oliveira says \u2014 oliveira returned to his hotel room , and decided that he could no longer work for simmons . between that day and their dramatic final meeting the following april , they socialized occasionally , and oliveira still provided massages . as simmons began cutting off most friends , his beloved dog hattie declined precipitously , defecating all over the house , and finally needing to be put down . oliveira visited the mansion in march 2014 , and found a depressing scene . \u201che was sleeping at 2 p.m. on a sunday , \u201d oliveira says . \u201ci said , \u2018richard , you need to get up . you need to do something. \u2019 he said , \u2018no i \u2019 m tired , let me sleep. \u2019 and nobody cares . i walked downstairs and said , \u2018teresa , richard needs treatment. \u2019 she said , \u2018i don \u2019 t care. \u2019 \u201d oliveira and simmons parted ways in april , and after that , oliveira says he communicated only with simmons \u2019 accountant about the apartment , which he vacated that october , and the request for money that he did not receive . upon his return from the european vacation , simmons made only a few more public appearances . at the macy \u2019 s thanksgiving day parade in november 2013 , he rode in a turtle float , and interacted enthusiastically with the crowd . on january 16 , 2014 , he attended a los angeles fundraiser for covered california , the state \u2019 s health insurance exchange . his most recent media interview , as far as catalano can recall , was on new year \u2019 s eve 2013 , when he appeared for five minutes on cnn with anchor brooke baldwin , and left in tears . the mood began to turn after simmons encouraged viewers to be non-judgmental when they looked in the mirror . \u201cwhat do you say to yourself in the mirror in the morning ? \u201d baldwin asked . \u201ci say , \u2018try to help more people , \u2019 \u201d simmons responded , his voice cracking .         back in the \u2019 70s , when slimmons was still called the ruffage and anatomy asylum , a woman named ellen would often come in and order a small juice . she was less than 5 feet tall , and skinny . simmons could detect in her quiet demeanor a fellow survivor of childhood teasing and trauma . \u201calthough she always wore the mask of a pleasant smile on her face , \u201d he wrote in his memoir , \u201ci \u2019 m sure ellen endured years of being teased about her appearance . just as people who are very overweight are often made fun of , people who are very thin are fair game , too. \u201d ellen made and sold teddy bears , and on simmons \u2019 birthday she brought him an original creation , with rusty brown fur and a smile . over the next few months , she remained quiet and reserved , but would occasionally leave beautiful bears for simmons , with notes that said , \u201ci hope this makes your day. \u201d one morning , simmons arrived to find a minuscule box by the door . \u201cinside , wrapped in tissue , was the tiniest , most detailed teddy bear i \u2019 d ever seen , \u201d he later wrote . \u201cit was no more than the size of a postage stamp \u2014 it must have been made under a large magnifying glass . unlike ellen \u2019 s other works , this was not a happy-looking bear . it seemed very lonely sitting in that box , all by itself. \u201d simmons kept ellen \u2019 s bears in his living room , and now noticed that they had been getting smaller , as the months ticked by . days passed , and he didn \u2019 t see her , so simmons became worried , and asked about her at a beverly hills boutique that sold her work . \u201cshe died a few days ago , \u201d the owner said . ellen had been anorexic , and simmons has tormented himself for decades with the thought that he could have done more for her . he has spent a lifetime immersed in the deep end of other people \u2019 s despair , working to lift them out . now , friends fear that he is the one wasting away . in january 2015 , tmz reported that the lapd , acting on an anonymous tip , sent two officers to check on simmons , and found him responsive and alert . michael catalano points to this as evidence that simmons is fine , and says that he last saw his client during the 2015 holiday season , while lenny and kathy simmons visited . \u201che was in great health , \u201d catalano says . but those words do little to comfort the folks who care about simmons , who fear that the next news they hear will be the worst , and be left to wonder if they should have been more aggressive in their attempts to save him . in the absence of any news from the hollywood hills mansion , one is left to fill in the blanks . thoughts inevitably turn to the troubled beach boy brian wilson and his possessive guru , dr. eugene landy , or the final , isolated years of michael jackson and his prescription-happy doctor , conrad murray . the mind slips to dark places , when deprived of information . \u201che has to know his friends and the community are so concerned , \u201d says one of the longtime friends who spoke on the condition of anonymity . \u201cshow business is one thing , but friends are another . if he had any say in the matter , he would reach out to any of us . i \u2019 m very suspicious , as it just doesn \u2019 t make sense . it \u2019 s very bizarre . it \u2019 s beyond mysterious . if something is going on , we want to be there for him . we want to support him. \u201d     corrections : in an earlier edition , we stated that simmons lived and studied in venice ; it was florence ; the covered california event simmons attended was january 16 , 2014 , not january 30 ; professor rhonda garelick , previously identified as a professor of fine- and performing arts at the university of nebraska-lincoln is temporarily on leave from the university . she currently is a professor of comparative literature at princeton .     credits : digital longform editor , joe angio ; deputy digital longform editor , bruce diamond ; senior interactive developer , mike sullivan\n"}, {"url":

46 million pretax over 12 months -- $ 13 million more than second-ranked melissa mccarthy , who pocketed $ 33 million .     lawrence ' s impressive earnings consist largely of a profit slice from the big box office gross ( $ 653.4 million ) of her final hunger games installment and a mammoth upfront fee for the forthcoming passengers . her total is down 11.5 % from $ 52 million in 2015 , but she remains the girl on fire , financially speaking .     mccarthy , 45 , is this year ' s biggest dollar gainer year over year ; her earnings are up $ 10 million on 2015 ' s estimate thanks in part to a reported eight-figure payday for ghostbusters . this year , the mike &amp; molly star recorded her biggest annual paycheck to date , out-earning scarlett johansson ( no . 3 , $ 25 million ) .     \u201ci started to think if i could do anything to build women up rather than the constant tear down i \u2019 m going to do it , \u201d mccarthy , who started her own all-sizes clothing line , told forbes .     once again , we examined stars from around the globe , scouring bollywood and the burgeoning chinese cinema industry . to wit , 30 % of the list hail from outside the u.s. ; chinese actress fan bingbing makes the cut for the second consecutive year , while charlize theron , a dual citizen of south african and the u.s. , returns to the list for the first time since 2013.     india ' s deepika padukone is the only newcomer to the ranking . the 30-year-old joins the list with bollywood hits such as bajirao mastani , though she earns far less than her hollywood counterparts for roles . instead , she compensates with over a dozen lucrative endorsements -- a hedging tactic employed by many of her hollywood peers .     full list : the world \u2019 s highest-paid actresses 2016     in an industry where a pay gap with male actors still exists , 90 % of the world ' s highest-paid actresses supplement their on-screen earnings with endorsements . a particular standout : jennifer aniston ( no . 4 ) , 47 , whose advertisements for emirates airlines , smartwater , aveeno and living proof comprise a chunk of her $ 21 million earnings .     together , the world ' s 10 highest-paid actresses tallied a combined $ 205 million between june 1 , 2015 , and june 1 , 2016 , before fees and taxes . four women , up from three in 2015 , banked more than $ 20 million compared with 18 of the world ' s leading men ( a separate list of highest-paid actors will be published thursday ) .     though these select actresses earn more than most could dream of , their movie money is but a fraction of what many of their male counterparts pocket . while top actresses can negotiate eight figure upfront fees plus a cut of profits for leading parts in big budget movies , there are simply fewer of those roles available for women . in fact , a recent study found that female characters fill only 28.7 % of all speaking roles in film . when women are on screen , they are likely to be eye candy for a male gaze : women appeared in sexy attire more than a third of the time and were shown partially or fully nude 27.5 % of the time , three times as much as men .     it ' s a phenomenon up-and-comer brie larson experienced firsthand . \u201cthere were many times that i would go into auditions and the casting directors would say , \u2018it \u2019 s really great , we love what you

well-known names including sandra bullock , angelina jolie , kristen stewart , reese witherspoon and cameron diaz were among the drop-offs on this year ' s ranking . there were also some noteworthy near misses : kristen wiig , ren\u00e9e zellweger and cate blanchett all narrowly missed the $ 10 million cut off for this year ' s ranking .     where last year ' s ranking evaluated 18 women , this year ' s list has returned to the top 10 to give a more accurate portrait of acting ' s earning elite . earnings estimates are based on data from nielsen , box office mojo and imdb , as well as
