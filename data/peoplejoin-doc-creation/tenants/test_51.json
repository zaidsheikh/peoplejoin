( / lionsgate )     an air of wholesome , stolid assurance pervades \u201cbridge of spies , \u201d a handsome , sober-minded cold war thriller about a little-known chapter of american history . and why not ? this absorbing tale of tradecraft , political ideals and unimpeachable moral character has been brought to the screen by no less a craftsman than steven spielberg , here directing from a script written by joel and ethan coen , with matt charman .     in case that pedigree isn \u2019 t convincing enough , tom hanks stars as the film \u2019 s inspiring lead character , a quietly heroic new york lawyer who in another era would have been portrayed by james stewart or gary cooper .     hanks is his generation \u2019 s answer to those paragons of rectitude , and in \u201cbridge of spies \u201d he reminds us why . as james donovan , who in 1957 defended \u2014 unsuccessfully \u2014 accused soviet spy rudolf abel at the behest of the u.s. government , hanks exudes modesty , high principles and simple fairness . when the plot thickens and he becomes involved in a swap of prisoners to take place in east germany \u2014 abel for u.s. pilot francis gary powers , whose u-2 was shot down over the soviet union in 1960 \u2014 he shifts his trademark humility into overdrive , insisting to his communist intermediaries that he has a cold and just wants \u201cto go home and get into bed. \u201d one of the many subtexts of the film \u2019 s low-key brinkmanship is how the cold war kept from getting hot ; hanks has always been disarming , but in this case he \u2019 s literally as well as figuratively so .     hanks \u2019 s aw-shucks charm could easily curdle into smugness here , but spielberg keeps the self-righteousness to a minimum . when he allows donovan to speechify , it \u2019 s on behalf of constitutional due process and american fair play . these are clearly meant to resonate in the era of guantanamo and mass surveillance \u2014 much as the fractiousness and executive strong-arming in spielberg \u2019 s \u201clincoln \u201d chimed with realpolitik in 21st-century washington . mostly , though , the director simply follows the action , first as donovan meets his client , abel , a taciturn sleeper agent , and then as both men \u2019 s fates intertwine with the u-2 episode , an obscure american graduate student living in west berlin and the emergent geopolitical identity of a brand-new east germany .     filmed by longtime spielberg cinematographer janusz kaminski , \u201cbridge of spies \u201d looks as if it \u2019 s been carved from granite and mist . blues , grays and chilly puffs of white light are to spielberg what syrupy ambers are to woody allen . spielberg \u2014 himself a child of the duck-and-cover 1950s \u2014 adroitly establishes the heaviness and barely contained paranoia of the time , which he depicts with rich , unnostalgic atmosphere . he \u2019 s also done a good job of casting actors blessed with timeless features , especially amy ryan , who plays donovan \u2019 s wife with understated elegance and a few particularly well-timed sidelong glances .         with his aw-shucks charm kept under control by director steven spielberg , tom hanks plays a lawyer who in another era would have been portrayed by james stewart or gary cooper . ( jaap buitendijk/dreamworks / twentieth century fox film )     it should come as no surprise that spielberg moves viewers through donovan \u2019 s story with good taste and practiced confidence . with the help of some clever cuts and dissolves from editor michael kahn , he imparts an enormous amount of information in a series of swift , graceful scenes that firmly establish the protagonist \u2019 s hard-nosed negotiating skills as well as his reflexive belief that america \u2019 s democratic values are its best weapon . the narrative of \u201cbridge of spies \u201d flags only when donovan arrives in east germany , where he embarks on a series of talky , often bizarre encounters with kgb apparatchiks and shadowy satellite figures , the most amusing of which involves members of abel \u2019 s fake \u201cfamily , \u201d who implore the american attorney to free their husband and father . ( as he often does , spielberg also can \u2019 t seem to decide on an ending for \u201cbridge of spies , \u201d so he supplies three. )     part of the reason why the germany sequences sag is that they don \u2019 t feature abel , who is played by british actor mark rylance in what , with luck , will be a career-making performance . many viewers may not have heard of rylance , who recently played thomas cromwell in \u201cwolf hall \u201d on pbs . but his work in \u201cbridge of spies \u201d deserves to be widely recognized as an example of screen acting at its most subtle , poignant and exquisitely calibrated .     in the film \u2019 s near-wordless opening section , during which abel goes about his daily business as an unassuming painter , rylance communicates volumes about his character \u2019 s discipline and isolation , simply by way of facial expression and body language . later , as abel and donovan develop an alliance of mutual understanding and respect , he relaxes just enough to indulge a streak of deadpan , unmistakably slavic humor .     rylance turns in a sensitive , deeply etched portrayal of a studiously nondescript criminal . yet \u201cbridge of spies \u201d expands from being a smart , engrossing procedural to a carefully observed character study of donovan , a particularly intriguing , heretofore overlooked american figure . thanks to his own reflexive values , spielberg can \u2019 t help but make the kind of inspiring , classically constructed drama that we keep being told hollywood doesn \u2019 t produce anymore .     thank goodness he still does .\n"}, {"url": "file://test/51/2/0", "title": "test/51/2/0", "content": "the \" super tunnels \" were the sixth and seventh found between tijuana and san diego since 2010.     this image shows an agent examining one of two tunnels discovered april 1 , 2014 in san diego ' s otay mesa industrial park . the first tunnel , stretching about 600 yards , was discovered on tuesday . authorities say it was equipped with lighting , a crude rail system and wooden trusses . the other tunnel was discovered thursday . it \u2019 s described as stretching more than 700 yards and more sophisticated , with an electric rail system and ventilation equipment .

his exchange for a detained u.s. soldier on behalf of the cia . but that ' s just scratching the surface of this very thoughtful meditation on doing the right thing \u2014 embodied in the burgeoning friendship between abel and donovan .     donovan fights for abel despite the scorn of the public , the indifference of the legal system and the danger to his family . when he goes to berlin to negotiate the exchange of abel for a detained u-2 pilot francis gary powers ( austin stowell ) , donovan decides , against the wishes of the u.s. , to try to tack on the release of another imprisoned

enough to get worked up over . it ' s impossible not to like him .     but the story ' s focus on abel is juxtaposed with near indifference to francis gary powers and the detained american student
