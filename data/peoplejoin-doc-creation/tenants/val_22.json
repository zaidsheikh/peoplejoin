[ wipe out : history ' s most mysterious extinctions ]     \" this is one of the fundamental inflection points in the trajectory of life on earth , \" burgess said . \" it set the stage for the [ rest ] of evolution . \"     the best record of the permian \" great dying \" is in meishan , china . in past decades , hundreds of geologists collected and analyzed rocks in meishan that date from before , during and after the permian extinction . researchers analyzed these rocks to better understand what caused the permian event . volcanic ash beds interlaced with meishan marine rocks have tiny minerals called zircons that can be precisely dated with geochemical techniques , and the marine rocks carry scores of fossils that record the die-off and resurgence of life .     burgess and his co-authors improved the meishan rock ages with the latest high-resolution , uranium-lead zircon dating techniques . zircon traps minute amounts of naturally occurring radioactive uranium inside its crystal structure . uranium decays into lead , and counting the ratio of the two elements provides an age estimate for the zircons .     the new dates show that the mass extinction started 251.941 million years ago ( plus or minus 37,000 years ) and ended at 251.880 million years ago ( plus or minus 31,000 thousand years ) . the extinction ' s end also marks the start of the triassic period , and coincides with the first fossil appearance at meishan of a toothy , eel-like creature called hindeodus parvus ( a conodont , the source of the earliest teeth found in the fossil record ) .     finding the killer( s )     the new timeline also provides greater accuracy for the environmental blows linked with the mass dying . for example , previous work has found an increase in carbon dioxide , a greenhouse gas , before the mass extinction began . in the permian rocks , atmospheric carbon dioxide shifts are recorded as changes in the ratio of carbon isotopes .     the new study suggests the increase in carbon dioxide was sudden and short-lived , burgess said . \" it precedes the extinction by 20,000 years or so , and lasts 10,000 or 15,000 years . it was very short-duration event , \" he said .     but there are other potential tipping points for extinction beyond atmospheric greenhouse gases . for example , sea surface temperatures also rose about 18 degrees fahrenheit ( 10 degrees celsius ) over a period beginning before the extinction and continuing into the early triassic . and the sudden carbon dioxide increase may have made the oceans more acidic .

. it was a \u201cmilestone for all people and our planet , \u201d said un secretary-general ant\u00f3nio guterres , who highlighted the positive impacts of the montreal protocol on human health , poverty eradication , climate change , and protecting the food chain at an anniversary celebration .     the earth \u2019 s ozone layer would have collapsed by 2050 with catastrophic consequences without the montreal protocol , studies have shown . in the world we avoided thanks to the protocol the uv index measure during a washington , dc or los angles mid-summer day would be at least 30 by 2070. anything over 11 is considered extreme . there would have been an additional 280 million cases of skin cancer , 1.5 million skin cancer deaths , and 45 million cataracts in the united states , according to the u.s. epa .     further , climate change would have been far worse by mid-century because the chemicals that \u201ceat \u201d ozone are also super-greenhouse gases , thousands of times more potent than co2 . and that would have meant the potential intensity of hurricanes and cyclones would have increased three times , another study found .     the combined impacts of uv levels that could literally burn skin in five minutes and hotter , stormier weather is something no one would want to live in or wish for their grandchildren , said rolando garcia , a senior scientist at the national center for atmospheric research ( ncar ) in boulder , colorado .     our global climate would be at least 25 per cent hotter today without the protocol , said garcia , a co-author of two world-avoided studies . that additional heat energy would have provided \u201cfuel\u201c for today \u2019 s extreme weather events like hurricanes , floods , and droughts . by 2070 the world would have been 4.5 degrees f ( 2.5 degrees celsius ) hotter , a level most experts agree is disastrously high .     \u201cin 1987 i don \u2019 t think anyone knew about the full climate implications , \u201d said garcia . \u201cthe protocol saved our bacon a little bit. \u201d     ozone politics     the ozone layer acts like a shield reducing the amount of the sun ' s ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation to safer levels . by the late 1970s scientists proved chemicals used in fridges , air conditioners , and aerosol cans were damaging this ozone shield . but the chemical industry argued the science was uncertain , and more research was needed . then , in 1985 , a gigantic hole appeared in the ozone layer over antarctica , allowing dangerous levels of uv radiation to reach the surface . by 1987 the montreal protocol was created to reduce the amounts of those chemicals .     industry lobbied the ronald reagan white house and tried to get the senate to deny ratification of the protocol , warning of dire economic impacts resulting from a phase-down of their products .     \u201cit was just as bad as the fossil fuel industry has been on climate change , \u201d said david doniger , director , climate and clean air program at the natural resources defense council .     view images people bathe in the sea in southern france \u2014 but without a protective ozone layer , such activities would be much more dangerous . photograph by bertrand langlois , afp , getty images     and yet the u.s. was one of the first countries to ratify the protocol and have been a leader on the revisions that sped up the phase-outs of ozone-destroying chemicals , doniger said . industry soon developed new products and got on board with the phase-out of the old chemicals .     the protocol now has 197 countries participating and resulted in the phase-out of 99 percent of nearly 100 ozone-depleting chemicals . it \u2019 s often considered the most successful international environmental treaty in history .     \" thirty years ago the world proved it can come together and tackle a global problem with global resolve , \u201d said erik solheim , head of the united nations environment programme ( unep ) .     \u201cthe montreal protocol is as necessary today as it was in the 1980s , \u201d solheim said .     unfinished business     the ozone layer is expected to recover by 2050 but the protocol has two major pieces of unfinished business . some countries in the developing world haven \u2019 t yet phased out ozone-damaging chemicals like r-22 , a hydrochlorofluorocarbon ( hcfc ) found in many refrigeration and air conditioning systems . they \u2019 ll require financial support to do so , which the protocol provides under its multilateral fund .     the multilateral fund will need to be replenished for the next three years at the upcoming montreal protocol conference in november . the u.s. usually provides about 20 percent of the funding , but \u201cthe trump administration has been completely silent on this so far , \u201d said doniger .     this funding is crucial to help poor countries not only eliminate the last ozone-damaging chemicals but also to leapfrog cheap replacement chemicals called hydrofluorocarbons ( hfcs ) . while hfcs are safe for ozone , they are a powerful greenhouse gas , a thousand times worse than co2 . in 2016 , after nearly ten years of negotiations , more than 150 countries agreed to reduce their use by 85 percent in the coming decades .     the use of hfcs for air conditioning and refrigeration is growing at a fast pace in developing countries , particularly china and india , doniger said . that \u2019 s in part because climate change is producing more and longer deadly heat waves and driving up summer temperatures .     this hfc phase down is known as the kigali amendment to the protocol and would have a big impact on climate change , cutting global warming up to 0.9 degrees f ( 0.5 degrees celsius ) by the end of the century , according to the unep .     that \u2019 s a big deal because even limiting global warming to under 3.6 degrees f ( 2 degrees celsius ) will still cut africa \u2019 s agricultural yields by 40 percent , putting 50 percent of the continent \u2019 s population at risk of undernourishment .\n"}, {"url": "file://val/22/1/1", "title": "val/22/1/1", "content": "sea scorpions , the eurypterids , were probably the largest arthropods ever to have lived . they disappeared in the world \u2019 s most devastating mass extinction to date . credit : \u00a9 john sibbick / natural history museum the largest mass extinction in the history of animal life occurred some 252 million years ago , wiping out more than 96 percent of marine species and 70 percent of life on land \u2014 including the largest insects known to have inhabited the earth . multiple theories have aimed to explain the cause of what ' s now known as the end-permian extinction , including an asteroid impact , massive volcanic eruptions , or a cataclysmic cascade of environmental events . but pinpointing the cause of the extinction requires better measurements of how long the extinction period lasted .     now researchers at mit have determined that the end-permian extinction occurred over 60,000 years , give or take 48,000 years \u2014 practically instantaneous , from a geologic perspective . the new timescale is based on more precise dating techniques , and indicates that the most severe extinction in history may have happened more than 10 times faster than scientists had previously thought .     \" we ' ve got the extinction nailed in absolute time and duration , \" says sam bowring , the robert r. shrock professor of earth and planetary sciences at mit . \" how do you kill 96 percent of everything that lived in the oceans in tens of thousands of years ? it could be that an exceptional extinction requires an exceptional explanation . \"     in addition to establishing the extinction ' s duration , bowring , graduate student seth burgess , and a colleague from the nanjing institute of geology and paleontology also found that , 10,000 years before the die-off , the oceans experienced a pulse of light carbon , which likely reflects a massive addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere . this dramatic change may have led to widespread ocean acidification and increased sea temperatures by 10 degrees celsius or more , killing the majority of sea life .     but what originally triggered the spike in carbon dioxide ? the leading theory among geologists and paleontologists has to do with widespread , long-lasting volcanic eruptions from the siberian traps , a region of russia whose steplike hills are a result of repeated eruptions of magma . to determine whether eruptions from the siberian traps triggered a massive increase in oceanic carbon dioxide , burgess and bowring are using similar dating techniques to establish a timescale for the permian period ' s volcanic eruptions that are estimated to have covered over five million cubic kilometers .     \" it is clear that whatever triggered extinction must have acted very quickly , \" says burgess , the lead author of a paper that reports the results in this week ' s proceedings of the national academy of sciences , \" fast enough to destabilize the biosphere before the majority of plant and animal life had time to adapt in an effort to survive . \"     pinning dates on an extinction     in 2006 , bowring and his students made a trip to meishan , china , a region whose rock formations bear evidence of the end-permian extinction ; geochronologists and paleontologists have flocked to the area to look for clues in its layers of sedimentary rock . in particular , scientists have focused on a section of rock that is thought to delineate the end of the permian , and the beginning of the triassic , based on evidence such as the number of fossils found in surrounding rock layers .     bowring sampled rocks from this area , as well as from nearby alternating layers of volcanic ash beds and fossil-bearing rocks . after analyzing the rocks in the lab , his team reported in 2011 that the end-permian likely lasted less than 200,000 years . however , this timeframe still wasn ' t precise enough to draw any conclusions about what caused the extinction .     now , the team has revised its estimates using more accurate dating techniques based on a better understanding of uncertainties in timescale measurements .     with this knowledge , bowring and his colleagues reanalyzed rock samples collected from five volcanic ash beds at the permian-triassic boundary . the researchers pulverized rocks and separated out tiny zircon crystals containing a mix of uranium and lead . they then isolated uranium from lead , and measured the ratios of both isotopes to determine the age of each rock sample .     from their measurements , the researchers determined a much more precise \" age model \" for the end-permian extinction , which now appears to have lasted about 60,000 years \u2014 with an uncertainty of 48,000 years \u2014 and was immediately preceded by a sharp increase in carbon dioxide in the oceans .     ' spiraling toward the truth '     the new timeline adds weight to the theory that the extinction was triggered by massive volcanic eruptions from the siberian traps that released volatile chemicals , including carbon dioxide , into the atmosphere and oceans . with such a short extinction timeline , bowring says it is possible that a single , catastrophic pulse of magmatic activity triggered an almost instantaneous collapse of all global ecosystems .     to confirm whether the siberian traps are indeed the extinction ' s smoking gun , burgess and bowring plan to determine an equally precise timeline for the siberian traps eruptions , and will compare it to the new extinction timeline to see where the two events overlap . the researchers will investigate additional areas in china to see if the duration of the extinction can be even more precisely determined .     \" we ' ve refined our approach , and now we have higher accuracy and precision , \" bowring says . \" you can think of it as slowly spiraling in toward the truth . \"     explore further : timeline of a mass extinction : new evidence points to rapid collapse of earth \u2019 s species 252 million years ago     more information : \" high-precision timeline for earth ' s most severe extinction , \" by seth d. burgess , samuel bowring , and shu-zhong shen . www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1317692111\n"}], "farshid": [{"url": "file://val/22/2/1", "title": "val/22/2/1", "content": "\" pee-wee ' s big holiday . \" netflix     when paul reubens created the pee-wee herman character in the early 1980s as a stage act , audiences instantly fell in love with not just the exterior \u2014 tight-fitting gray suit , red bow tie , unusual voice \u2014 but his childlike admiration for life and all its quirkiness .     pee-wee then became a household name when reubens structured the act as a children ' s tv show , then teamed with tim burton to make the classic \" pee-wee ' s big adventure . \"     with netflix seemingly eager to bring back just about anything we ' re nostalgic for from the past few decades \u2014 \" full house , \" \" gilmore girls \" \u2014 it jumped at the chance to make a new pee-wee movie with reubens and producer judd apatow .     and i ' m here to tell you that \" pee-wee ' s big holiday \" is as much fun as the first pee-wee movie .
