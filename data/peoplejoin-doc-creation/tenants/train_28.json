southern california or to his other job where he helps run a recreational marijuana startup . but today the 37-year-old los angeles native rolled out of bed a little earlier , still groggy , to talk on the phone about his other life \u2014 his most prominent and public one \u2014 as the greatest tetris player in the world .     it \u2019 s a title that grows more inarguable as neubauer racks up championship after championship . eight classic tetris world championship ( ctwc ) tournaments have been held since the competition \u2019 s inception in 2010. neubauer has won seven of them .         on one hand , neubauer is just a normal guy who works at a bar , drinks a lot of coffee , and plays video games in his downtime . on the other , he \u2019 s a niche rock star in a rapidly growing e-sports community that one day hopes to be represented at the olympics \u2014 with neubauer as its spokesperson . \u201cit \u2019 s kind of a d-list celebrity , \u201d neubauer laughs . \u201cbut in a certain circle , you \u2019 re pretty popular. \u201d     this weekend , the reigning champ plays for his eighth world title against the largest and most competitive field he ' s ever faced . players from all over the world are traveling to portland , oregon , for the tournament , including the european champion svavar gunnarsson , japanese tetris grandmaster and renowned hyper-tapper koji \" koryan \" nishio , and 16-year-old american prodigy joseph saelee .     \" it \u2019 s basically the entire field vs. jonas , \u201d says adam cornelius , who organizes the ctwc tournament each year and directed the documentary ecstasy of order : the tetris masters . for 362 days of the year , neubauer may be a regular guy who wakes up late and works at a bar . but during the ctwc tournament , he ' s the most respected man in the room .     jonas neubauer playing tetris at home . \u00a9 coley brown     most days , neubauer goes to work and comes home without discussing his niche fame . it took some coworkers years to find out . neubauer remembers walking into the taproom one day and hearing a teasing voice yell out , \u201cyou bastard ! i saw a video of you playing . why didn \u2019 t you tell me ? \u201d some days , when his hobby does come up , he signs autographs , takes pictures , and humors challengers at the bar with a quick game , rapidly and effortlessly stacking blocks .     neubauer uses a unique and chaotic approach to playing tetris , stacking blocks high from left to right and quickly spinning pieces and tucking them into the right position at the very last second . it \u2019 s a hectic strategy that makes you believe he can \u2019 t find a way out , until he miraculously does .     \u201cwhat makes jonas so scary and dominant is that he is somehow the most solid , fundamentally sound player , and the most light on his feet and creative at the same time , \u201d cornelius says . \u201che ' s like tim duncan one minute and then steph curry the next. \u201d     neubauer likens his playing style to a jazz pianist : chaotic , unpredictable , and always improvising without much of a plan . his playing style echoes his personality , which his wife heather ito describes as interesting and quick-witted , yet ironically oblivious . when neubauer asked ito to marry him , she replied , \u201care you sure ? \u201d just to make sure he actually thought about it beforehand . ito \u2019 s watched him play tetris nearly every day for more than half a decade . if anyone knows how spontaneous he can be with his decisions , it \u2019 s her .     \u201ci actually got burnt out playing that way for a while , \u201d neubauer says . \u201cit \u2019 s kind of a stressful way to play tetris . especially if you \u2019 re in a tournament and in front of a crowd , because it \u2019 s actively thinking with your front brain , and that \u2019 s the part that gets overwhelmed and distracted. \u201d     when he plays , however , neubauer seems as cool as a cucumber . he started streaming his games on twitch under the username \u201cnubbinsgoody \u201d last year , drawing tens of thousands of viewers . as blocks rain down his screen , neubauer laughs at comments and casually responds to questions from viewers , sharing tips and strategies as he goes . oftentimes , he looks away from his screen to check on something in the room around him or chat with ito , who \u2019 s also a highly proficient gamer . the two make an entertaining pair .     in the early days of the tournament , neubauer would only play tetris in the month leading up to the championship to dust off his skills . now , between streaming on twitch and practicing to take on more competitive challengers , \u201ci \u2019 ve been playing pretty much nonstop , \u201d neubauer says . \u201c[ tetris ] used to not be a big part of my identity , but now it is. \u201d     jonas neubauer and heather ito . \u00a9 coley brown     streaming his practice sessions on tetris also means sharing his playbook . \u201cyou can \u2019 t grow something when you have the same dude [ winning ] the tournaments each year , \u201d the champion says . \u201ci want to equip people with a more confident and stronger game so they can continue to come in every year and look forward to it . \"     saelee , the 15-year-old prodigy making his first appearance at the ctwc this year , is one of the many new players who learned tetris strategy by watching neubauer play online . \u201ci watch jonas ' s twitch channel every time i can , \u201d says saelee , who became the first player to ever reach level 31 in classic tetris in late september \u2014 something even neubauer hasn \u2019 t done . \u201ci would say most of my gameplay is based off jonas ' s gameplay . i try to play exactly like him for the most part. \u201d     neubauer and ito often talk about how it would probably be best for someone else to win the tournament . harry hong is the only player to beat him in 2014 . \u201cthey call it a \u2018world championship , \u2019 but really it \u2019 s just these two guys from la who have won every year , \u201d ito says . \u201cnow there \u2019 s people coming from japan and finland and iceland , and if someone from the rest of the world could actually win it , it would legitimize the tournament in a really nice way. \u201d         it ' s clear talking with neubauer that the future of tetris is on his mind these days as much as his own future . he talks about transitioning to being a teacher and ambassador of the sport as if it \u2019 s his duty \u2014 giving back to a video game that , in many ways , has shaped his life and helped get him through the toughest parts of it .     \u00a9 coley brown     neubauer entered the 2010 tournament soon after his father \u2019 s death earlier that year . \u201cit was this new adventure that i could embark on and try to make a positive trajectory out of a bummer situation , \u201d he says . \u201cmaybe i needed that first [ win ] . the ones that came afterwards were icing on the cake. \u201d         neubauer describes navigating the roadblocks of life the same way he strategizes with the virtual blocks of tetris . \u201cyou can \u2019 t control what happens to the people in your life , but you can control what comes after , \u201d he says . as he puts it , the secret to playing the game is coming to terms with your decisions and making the best move based off your current situation .     \u201cthe way he plays tetris , he never settles for a move , \u201d ito said . \u201cthere \u2019 s always more . there \u2019 s always some different way of looking at it , even if it \u2019 s always not necessarily going to work out for you . even if it \u2019 s not the optimal choice , it \u2019 s still worth considering. \u201d     ito was drawn to neubauer \u2019 s self-described \u201cobsessive \u201d personality when they first met . he is always curious , she says , and constantly engrossing himself in new topics and making an effort to learn as much as he can about his hobbies \u2014 which , recently , have included craft beer , hand-grinding coffee , and sourcing his own denim from japan .     but tetris has left neubauer trapped in an unconquerable loop since he was about ten . \u201ci \u2019 ll never have that kind of moment [ of closure ] with tetris , \u201d he says . \u201cit \u2019 s a little bit of both a blessing and a curse . it \u2019 s put me on an adventure , that \u2019 s for sure. \u201d     jonas neubauer . \u00a9 coley brown     neubauer has always been the best at tetris , ever since he was a young kid playing against friends in his parents \u2019 basement . by the time he was a teenager , no one wanted to play against him because they knew they ' d lose . neubauer kept practicing , however , pushing himself to the highest achievable level . his loss in 2014 was shocking . no one expected it . he ' d become so good at tetris , his defeat is a bigger story than any of his wins .         last year \u2019 s tournament was the most nerve-racking competition neubauer \u2019 s ever participated in . there ' s more pressure as his legend balloons within the gaming community . but no matter how long his reign as world champion lasts , neubauer ' s influence will undoubtedly trickle down . it \u2019 s already evidenced in players like saelee , who is one of 39 other competitors looking to dethrone him this weekend . the field \u2019 s getting bigger and better , and neubauer knows it \u2019 s only a matter of time before he ' s eclipsed .     \u201ci \u2019 ve found it easier to deal with what \u2019 s in and out of my control because of tetris , \u201d neubauer says . \u201cyou get a certain sequence of pieces in tetris , and that \u2019 s out of your control , but what you do with them is in your control . [ ... ] i don \u2019 t think there are a lot of regrets if you just trust that you \u2019 re doing the right thing and certain things are out of your hands. \u201d     update : on sunday night , 16-year-old joseph saelee ousted seven-time tetris world champion jonas neubauer , taking first place at the 2018 classic tetris world championship . watch saelee ' s winning moment in the clip below :     sign up for our newsletter to get the best of vice delivered to your inbox daily .     follow sean neumann on twitter .\n"}, {"url": "file://train/28/2/2", "title": "train/28/2/2", "content": "image copyright classic tetris world championship image caption joseph saelee and finalist jonas neubauer at the contest .     a 16-year-old boy from california was the surprise winner of the grand final of the classic tetris world championship in oregon .     the iconic block stacking computer game is 13 years older than him .     joseph saelee beat jonas neubauer , who has won seven times in the tournament ' s eight-year history .     he told the bbc he had started playing as a hobby after watching the championships in 2016 , and he plays on an original 1985 nintendo nes console .     he said he practises for a couple of hours each day on the device , hooked up to a \" blocky \" cathode ray tube ( crt ) television screen rather than a modern thin screen .     mr saelee said he prefers using the old-fashioned monitor because there is less latency - a tiny time difference between the controller and the visual .     \" my friends are like , ' what is this guy playing ' , \" he said .     \" tetris is easy to learn but it can take years to master . \"     he added that he intends to take part in the competition again next year .     \" i feel like i could still improve - it isn ' t just a one-time thing . \"\n"}]}, "user_id_to_descriptions": {"alice": "Is interested in compiling a summary.", "hannah": "Knows about the following topics:\nSan Francisco, suitcase, human body parts, dismembered, suspect\nSan Francisco, body parts, suitcase, homicide, police investigation\nSan Francisco, dismembered body, suitcase, police investigation\nTwitter, location, privacy\nRoseanne Barr, racist tweet, apology, show cancellation\nmonkey, DNA, gender, science, xenophobe\nJonas Neubauer, Tetris, world champion, Twitch, e-sports\nTetris, Joseph Saelee, Jonas Neubauer, Oregon, NES console"}, "user_id_to_table_names": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_templated": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_lowprecision": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_lowprecision_templated": {}}
