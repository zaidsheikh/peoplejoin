highlights the aclu blasts \" for-profit incarceration , \" says the riot wasn ' t surprising     the riot began with a fight among prisoners , a sheriff says     guard died due to what the coroner thinks was blunt force trauma     the sheriff praises law enforcement efforts and the private firm that runs the prison     hundreds of inmates in mississippi whose fight among themselves spiraled into a riot were back in their cells monday afternoon , leaving authorities to mourn the death of one guard and express thanks that things didn ' t turn out worse .     \" when we first ... learned of the situation , i had a high degree of anxiety because there were so many guards who were unaccounted for , \" adams county sheriff chuck mayfield said , praising the efforts of law enforcement and those with the private company that runs the facility . \" i know it when i see it when something is handled correctly . \"     by monday afternoon , all of the roughly 2,500 inmates at the adams county correctional facility in natchez were secure in their cells on lockdown , which mayfield said will continue indefinitely as the investigation continues .     it was a far different scene about 24 hours before .     mayfield said that , about 2 : 40 p.m. sunday , a fight broke out either among members of one gang or between members of rival factions in a prison yard and soon ballooned out of control . with a core group of about 300 inmates involved -- meaning most others were simply caught up in the chaos -- the disturbance quickly spread through the grounds .     \" it turned into a mob mentality , and ... it just expanded so quickly , \" the sheriff said .     sometime early in the riot , a guard was assaulted and ended up on the roof of a building , mayfield said . that guard -- later identified as catlin carithers , 24 -- was brought out through the facility ' s gates within an hour , only to be later pronounced dead due to blunt head force trauma , according to the county coroner .     guard catlin carithers was killed during the riot that broke out sunday at the mississippi prison .     the disturbance continued for hours more around the western mississippi facility , which houses illegal immigrants from around the region who are serving time after convictions for both violent and nonviolent crimes . the tennessee-based corrections corporation of america operates the facility and employs all those within .     at one point , inmates pulled out some mattresses , rags and other materials into a prison yard and started a fire . others used an array of weapons , such as mop and broom handles , in their fight .     meanwhile , the facility ' s employees at once tried to maintain order and take cover . mayfield said earlier monday that at least 24 or 25 hostages were being held at one point .     county and state authorities were on site within an hour to maintain the perimeter and help the corrections corporation of america ( cca ) bring the situation under control , according to mayfield , who noted that fbi agents were also there .     no gunshots were ever fired , and mayfield praised the \" restraint \" by law enforcement . authorities did use \" pepper balls , \" which the sheriff said are shot from something akin to a paintball gun .     \" the whole thing was probably over by 11 or 11 : 30 p.m. sunday , \" at which point all the inmates had been forced out into a prison yard , mayfield said . but it wasn ' t until 3 : 30 a.m. monday that every prisoner had been searched and brought back to his housing unit .     in addition to carithers , about 10 workers at the facility were injured , including one who suffered head trauma and was transported about 100 miles northwest to the university of mississippi medical center in jackson , according to the sheriff . cca , meanwhile , has reported that 16 of its staffers at the prison were treated and released from the hospital .     four inmates had to be taken to area emergency rooms for treatment -- for injuries such as a stab wound , a concussion and rib injuries -- though mayfield said he didn ' t think any of them needed to be admitted . cca had said three inmates received such treatment .     the sheriff stressed that the public was never in danger , as the riot was confined within the facility and there were no breaches of its perimeter .     while he didn ' t know what exactly caused the riot , mayfield did say that , \" from the outside looking in , i can ' t see anything that would have prevented it . \" he lavished praise on the decisions made by corrections corporation of america and law enforcement , saying , \" i don ' t think they could have handled it any better . \"     the sheriff added that the facility has \" not had anything of this magnitude at all \" since opening in 2009.     \" this could have happened anywhere , anytime , \" mayfield said .     yet the american civil liberties union said the riot wasn ' t surprising because companies like the corrections corporation of america \" have incentives to cut corners even at the expense of decent and safe conditions \" ; they employ \" too often poorly paid and trained \" staff ; and they run facilities with conditions that \" are often woefully inadequate . \"     \" this weekend ' s riot should make clear to mississippi and every other state that for-profit incarceration must end , \" the advocacy group said in a statement . \" we need to save taxpayer money by ending the nation ' s addiction to incarceration , not give money to private companies whose profit depends on locking up as many people as possible . \"\n"}, {"url": "file://train/65/2/1", "title": "train/65/2/1", "content": "san bernardino , calif.

was he missing in his life ? \" asked nizaam ali , who worshipped with farook at a mosque in san bernardino \u2014 the city east of los angeles where farook killed and died .     as authorities identified the deceased and details about farook ' s life began to take shape , the question of what motivated the slaughter remained unanswered .     the fbi was investigating the shootings as a potential act of terrorism but reached no firm conclusions thursday , said a u.s. official briefed on the probe . separately , a u.s. intelligence official said farook had been in contact with known islamic extremists on social media . both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly .     at the same time , law enforcement officials from local police to attorney general loretta lynch cautioned it could have been work-related rage . or a twisted hybrid of religion and personal vendetta .     farook had no criminal record and was not under scrutiny by local or federal law enforcement before the attacks .     police said the couple had more than 1,600 bullets when they were killed by authorities hours after wednesday ' s attack , and that the shooters had at home 12 pipe bombs , tools to make more explosives , and more than 3,000 rounds of ammunition .     police lt. mike madden , one of the first officers to reach the room at the social services center , where farook ' s colleagues from san bernardino county ' s public health department had gathered , said the carnage was \" unspeakable , \" the scene overwhelming : the smell of gunpowder , the wails of the injured , the blood , fire sprinklers pumping and fire alarms blaring . all in a room with a christmas tree and decorations on every table .     the dead ranged in age from 26 to 60. among the 21 injured were two police officers hurt during the manhunt , authorities said . two of the wounded remained in critical condition thursday .     nearly all the dead and wounded were county employees .     syed rizwan farook was born in chicago on june 14 , 1987 , to parents born in pakistan . he was raised in southern california .     in july 2010 , he was hired as a seasonal public employee and served until december of that year , according to a work history supplied by the county . in january 2012 , he was rehired as a trainee environmental health specialist before being promoted two years later . among his job duties was inspecting restaurants .     the soft-spoken farook was known to pray every day at san bernardino ' s dar al uloom al islamiyah mosque . that is where nizaam ali and his brother rahemaan ali met farook .     the last time rahemaan ali saw his friend was three weeks ago , when farook abruptly stopped coming to pray . rahemaan ali said farook seemed happy and his usual self . both brothers said they never saw anything to make them think farook was violent .     they remember when farook announced that he would be getting married , saying he had met his future wife online and that she was pakistani . farook told the brothers that he traveled to mecca in saudi arabia last summer .     they said he was gone about a month before returning to the u.s. with his wife . malik arrived on a k-1 visa for fianc\u00e9es and with a pakistani passport in july 2014 , authorities said .     the two were married on aug. 16 , 2014 , in nearby riverside county , according to their marriage license . both listed their religion as muslim . the couple had a 6-month-old daughter who they dropped with relatives wednesday morning before the shooting .     patrick baccari , who sat at the same table as farook at the employee party , recalled he was short on words and inclined to talk about cars , not religion .     however , a friend of a man killed in the rampage said farook had a heated conversation about islam two weeks before the attack .     kuuleme stephens said she happened to call nicholas thalasinos while her friend was talking with farook at work . she said thalasinos , a messianic jew who was passionately pro-israel , told her farook \" doesn ' t agree that islam is not a peaceful religion . \" stephens said farook replied that americans don ' t understand islam .     stephens added that thalasinos did not think their conversations would turn violent .     farook legally bought two handguns used in the massacre and their two assault rifles were legally bought by someone else federal authorities wanted to question . that person ' s identity was not released .     a profile on a matchmaking website for south asians that matched farook ' s name , california hometown , county health job and muslim faith said his interests included target shooting in his backyard . though the date of the posting was not clear , it listed his age as 22.     details about farook ' s upbringing are sparse .     he grew up in a turbulent home but later graduated from california state university , san bernardino , with a degree in environmental health sciences in 2010.     divorce records depicted a home divided by abuse . farook ' s mother alleged in 2006 that her husband , also named syed , attacked her while her children were present , dropped a tv on her and pushed her toward a car , according to records .     rafia sultana farook filed a petition for a domestic violence order of protection on july 3 , 2006 , against her husband . she said she was forced to move out with three of her children because her husband continually harassed her \" verbally and physically , \" according to the divorce records .     the associated press could not immediately reach the father for comment and was unable to corroborate the allegations in the records . no one answered the door

paul .     but many of the paul supporters had expected nothing less than resounding victory .     \" i kind of expected it actually , \" said brent young , a 45-year-old tea party activist who works
