help , \" kathryn stockett didn ' t simply introduce us to a few memorable individuals . she offered a meticulously etched portrait of a specific way of life .     tate taylor ' s eagerly anticipated adaptation is impactful in parts , but noticeably lacking in stockett ' s instinctive nuance .     though he grew up there himself , taylor ' s jackson , miss. , could be any suburban southern neighborhood in the early ' 60s . similarly , many of his actresses have little apparent connection to the intricate culture they are meant to portray .     emma stone , for example , is no one ' s idea of an ugly duckling . and though she offers a sincere effort , she never quite settles into the role of skeeter , an aspiring author whose plain looks and spinster status \u2014 at age 23 \u2014 horrify her beauty-queen mother ( allison janney , also miscast ) .     while her small-minded friends gossip through junior league meetings , she envisions her first book idea : to give voice to the african-american housekeepers ritually abused by the employers who need them .     in 1962 , when blacks and whites are divided by both prejudice and the law , skeeter ' s plan is dangerous for everyone involved .     but having been pushed to the limit , both aibileen ( viola davis ) and minny ( octavia spencer ) agree to share their experiences . all the while , they have to hide the project from their bosses , viciously racist hilly ( bryce dallas howard ) , ignorant elizabeth ( ahna o ' reilly ) and flighty celia ( jessica chastain ) .     while the book ' s minor \u2014 but crucial \u2014 details are often overlooked , the major themes are thrust on screen with forceful simplicity , as if taylor doesn ' t trust us to understand the stakes .     despite his unsubtle script , davis and spencer are experienced and assured enough to give their characters considerable depth , and their stirring portrayals make the film worth watching .     their younger castmates , unfortunately , needed more guidance than they evidently received . how much more powerful hilly ' s shameful cruelty , and skeeter ' s tentative rebellion , would have been if they felt intimate and complex , rather than grandly symbolic .     stockett ' s jackson was a suffocating hothouse where tendrils of ugliness grew amid women raised to be nothing more than beautiful . she illuminated both sin and valor by exposing \u2014 for better and worse \u2014 the humanity in all her characters .     in contrast , taylor ' s characters are familiar because we ' ve seen them in movies so many times before : heroes and villains drawn in broad strokes , residents of a world regrettably lacking shades of gray .\n"}, {"url": "file://train/26/2/1", "title": "train/26/2/1", "content": "ahmed chatayev

once given asylum in europe and acquitted in another attack in georgia , may have masterminded the coordinated terrorist attacks on the istanbul airport . his name is sometimes given as ahmed or chataev , and several media sites say he previously avoided extradition to russia after amnesty international advocated on his behalf . georgia \u2019 s former president says he was treated as a political prisoner in that country .     cnn reports that rep. michael mccaul , chairman of the u.s. house committee on homeland security , told the news site that it \u2019 s suspected chatayev \u201cdirected the three suicide bombers \u201d who slew 44 and injured more than 230 people in the attack on the istanbul airport . turkish media made the same claim , using a nickname for chatayev , the bbc says . the suicide bombers opened fire with rifles before exploding suicide bombs , says the voice of america . the voice of america says it was the turkish pro-government newspaper , yeni safak , that identified chatayev as the possible mastermind of the istanbul attack .     the u.s. government had previously suspected chatayev of planning terrorist attacks against turkish and american interests , although he was given asylum in austria years ago . nsnbc international reported on july 1 that turkish authorities had arrested chatayev , but cnn said his whereabouts were still unknown .     here \u2019 s what you need to know about him :     1. akhmed chatayev has only 1 arm     chatayev \u2019 s deformity earned him the nickname \u201cakhmed one-arm , \u201d reports fox news .     according to the international business times , chatayev has claimed that his arm was chopped off in prison . other sites have said chatayev lost the arm while fighting in the second chechen war , but it was this claim of torture that may have assisted him in avoiding extradition to russia before the istanbul airport attack .     2. chatayev was granted asylum by austria &amp; had an austrian passport     back then , amnesty international reminded ukraine chataev had refugee status in austria https://t.co/xpahjnhw73 pic.twitter.com/r254ggsskr \u2014 nahia sanzo ( @nsanzo ) june 30 , 2016     according to radio free europe , chatayev was previously granted asylum by austria . the voice of america reports that , chatayev became an austrian citizen in 2003 , two years after he left russia and applied for asylum there , and had an austrian passport that \u201callowed him to travel freely in europe and elsewhere. \u201d     the international business times also reports that chatayev was granted austrian asylum after fleeing russia 12 years ago . austria this april passed tough new asylum laws allowing migrants to be rejected at the border , says the bbc .     3. chatayev avoided extradition back to russia     the european union advised against extradition back to russia , reports rt question more .     citing translations of russian newspapers , the site reported that chatayev was detained in sweden in 2008 , where police found \u201ckalashnikov assault rifles , explosives and ammunition in his car . as a result , he spent more than a year in swedish prison. \u201d the site says that he was then arrested in 2010 in ukraine with \u201chis mobile phone files containing a demolition technique instruction and photos of people killed in a blast \u201d but the european court for human rights opposed the extradition , with amnesty international also speaking out against it .     the amnesty international press release uses a slightly different spelling of the name \u2014 ahmed chataev \u2014 but refers to the man as physically disabled , when arguing that his return to russia could mean the risk of torture .     nsnbc international reported that chatayev spent a year in a swedish prison and that ukraine would not extradite him . the news site says the european court of human rights has advisory status and \u201cruled against the extradition of chataev , claiming that he could risk an unfair trial and that he would be at risk of torture and ill-treatment. \u201d in 2011 , chatayev avoided extradition again , says the site . the voice of america puts it this way , \u201cin 2010 , he was arrested in ukraine at the request of russia \u2019 s security services but later released . in 2011 , he was arrested on the bulgaria-turkey border . he appealed the arrest and a court ordered his release under geneva refugee convention. \u201d     4. the suspected chechen ringleader is accused of training russian-speaking militants &amp; the u.s. had designated him a terrorist     fox news reports the possible mastermind \u201cappears to be a one-armed chechen terrorist who trained russian-speaking militants. \u201d radio free europe reports that chatayev leads a russian-speaking isis brigade called the yarmouk battalion . he is one of nine chechens believed to be fighting in syria , radio free europe says .     mccaul told cnn chatayev was \u201cprobably the no . 1 enemy in the northern caucus region of russia. \u201d the voice of america says turkish media identified one of the bombers as also being from chechnya .     chatayev targets immigrant men with european union passports and controls 130 isis fighters , the uk daily mail reports , citing the united nations security council for the latter figure . cnn says chatayev is a lieutenant in isis \u2019 war ministry .     the bbc says chatayev was already on a united states counter-terrorism sanctions list . in a 2015 press release , the u.s. department of the treasury named akhmed chatayev as a terrorist , saying , \u201cas of mid-2015 , chatayev was a member of isil and was part of a group of militants that was planning attacks against u.s. and turkish facilities. \u201d     the treasury department said that chatayev posted a video online , greeting militants who , in december 2012 , \u201cpledged allegiance to isil and its leader , abu bakr al-baghdadi. \u201d in the video , the u.s. government says , chatayev calls for more militants to also pledge allegiance to isis .     5. chatayev was cleared in a previous attack &amp; georgia \u2019 s former president
