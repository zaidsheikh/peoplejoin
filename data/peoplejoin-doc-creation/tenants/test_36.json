least temporarily i had it taken down because i don ' t want to be insulted , my children to be insulted , my family to be insulted . \"     ---     attorney general jeff sessions ' visit to houston has put one local restaurant in the crosshairs of the national debate about how restaurants should treat members of the trump administration .     sessions , in town on friday , august 10 , to address a meeting of federal prosecutors and law enforcement officials about the need to crackdown on violent crime and illegal immigration , dined at an el tiempo cantina in the inner loop after his speech . in turn , the restaurant posted a photo on facebook of sessions standing with chef-owner domenic laurenzo and a caption that read as follows :     \" we had the honor to server [ sic ] mr. jeff sessions , attorney general of the united states . thank you for allowing us to serve you . \"     sessions ' key role in the trump administration ' s immigration policies , including increased deportation and the practice of separating parents and children who attempt to cross the border illegally , has made him a controversial figure .     people immediately called for a boycott of any restaurant that considered serving him \" an honor , \" and the original post was quickly deleted . in its place , the restaurant posted the following statement from owner roland laurenzo :     el tiempo does not in anyway support the practice of separating children from parents or any other practices of the government relative to immigration . the posting of a photograph of the attorney general at one of our restaurants does not represent us supporting his positions . the secret service contacted us that a government official was coming to dinner at our establishment and his identity was not know until he walked through the door . the man came to dinner and he was served without us even thinking about the political situations . we were preoccupied with the secret service and catering to their wants and needs . the only thing on our minds was serving great food and giving great customer service . it was posted without review or approval by ownership and this has lead to everyone jumping to conclusions that somehow we are involved in this political matter . we don \u2019 t approve of anyone separating parents and children .     of course , that did little to stem the criticism , except that it now included trump administration supporters who disagreed with the restaurant ' s new statement and trump administration opponents who asserted the damage had already been done . others suggested that a restaurant should always feel honored to serve a senior government official regardless of whether the restaurant ' s staff agrees or disagrees with the person ' s policies and that el tiempo had done nothing wrong by thanking the attorney general for his visit .     how restaurants should treat trump administration officials has been a hot topic since june , when press secretary sarah huckabee sanders reported that she has been asked to leave the red hen in lexington , virginia . danny meyer , the legendary new york restaurateur and founder of shake shack , told cbs this morning that refusing service based on someone ' s beliefs constituted a slippery slope .     \" the minute you see me checking people ' s political registration at the door , that ' s a bad future , i think , for our business , \" meyer said .     curiously , el tiempo isn ' t the only tex-mex restaurant that sessions dined at during his visit . he ate breakfast at la mexicana , the popular montrose tex-mex restaurant . unlike el tiempo , la mexicana did not promote that sessions had visited ; rather , a reddit user spotted his security detail standing guard in front of the restaurant .     zulema gonzales , la mexicana ' s general manager , confirmed the visit to the houston chronicle . she said that sessions seemed unsure about what to order and settled on huevos rancheros at the suggestion of houston police chief art acevedo , who also attended the breakfast .     \" we treat everybody the same , \" gonzales told the newspaper .\n"}, {"url":

states has had a transformative impact on urban transportation . major cities have established large bikesharing systems , including boston , chicago , denver , minneapolis-saint paul , new york city , salt lake city , the san francisco bay area , seattle , washington dc , and others . these systems began operating as early as 2010 , and no fatalities have occurred within the us as of this writing . however , three have happened in north america \u2014 two in canada and one in mexico . bikesharing has some qualities that appear inherently unsafe for bicyclists . most prominently , helmet usage is documented to be quite low in most regions . bikesharing is also used by irregular bicyclists who are less familiar with the local terrain . in this study , researchers take a closer look at bikesharing safety from qualitative and quantitative perspectives . through a series of four focus groups , they discussed bikesharing usage and safety with bikesharing members and nonmembers in the bay area . they further engaged experts nationwide from a variety of fields to evaluate their opinions and perspectives on bikesharing and safety . finally , researchers conducted an analysis of bicycle and bikesharing activity data , as well as bicycle and bikesharing collisions to evaluate injury rates associated with bikesharing when compared with benchmarks of personal bicycling . the data analysis found that collision and injury rates for bikesharing are lower than previously computed rates for personal bicycling . experts and focus group participants independently pointed to bikesharing rider behavior and bikesharing bicycle design as possible factors . in particular , bikesharing bicycles are generally designed in ways that promote stability and limited speeds , which mitigate the conditions that contribute to collisions . data analysis also explored whether there was evidence of a \u201csafety in numbers benefit \u201d that resulted from bikesharing activity . however , no significant impact from bikesharing activity on broader bicycle collisions could be found within the regions in which they operate . discussion and recommendations are presented in the conclusion .     about the authors     elliot martin , ph.d.     elliot martin conducts research in shared-use mobility , public and freight transportation , transportation energy , and life-cycle

the thc-infused gummy candy that sent six students to the hospital faces seven felony charges and one misdemeanor charge .     mulberry \u2014 six mulberry middle school students were taken to the hospital after ingesting most of a 100-milligram block of thc-infused gummy candies thursday morning .     according to polk county sheriff grady judd , leviticus jones , 12 , somehow came into possession of the green hornet-brand gummies which , if taken as directed , would represent 10 individual doses . thc is the primary psychoactive chemical compound in cannabis .     detectives are investigating how jones acquired the gummy candies , as recreational use and possession of thc without a state-issued medical card is illegal in florida . edible products , such as the candy , are not currently available from dispensaries under state medical marijuana rules .     \u201ci warned us that all of this was coming , \u201d judd said in a press conference across from the school thursday afternoon . judd had been a staunch opponent of 2016 ' s amendment 2 , the state constitutional amendment that made medical marijuana legal under state law , and earlier attempts by proponents for medical use .     jones ' parents are cooperating with investigators , judd said , and understand the gravity of the situation .     judd said that jones shared the gummies with some friends during gym class .     a total of six children in seventh grade partook , judd said \u2014 two boys and four girls .     five were taken to the hospital via ambulance and one was transported by his or her parents .     jones faces seven felony charges \u2014 six counts of distribution within 1,000 feet of a school and one on possession of cannabis resin \u2014 and a misdemeanor charge of possession of paraphernalia .     judd said all the children are going to make a \u201cgreat recovery , \u201d but added \u201cobviously we are concerned how a 12-year-old could come into possession of this drug , this illegal drug in the state of florida . and two , why did he offer it to these six kids , which quite frankly , with the exception of one little quarter left , have apparently devoured this bar during gym class ? \u201d     polk county schools superintendent jacqueline byrd said she applauds the staff for their quick response .     \u201cwhen they heard something had happened with the students , they responded immediately , \u201d she said .     byrd said they went by classroom to check the children , contacted emergency medical services , and their parents .     \u201cbut you know , the sad part of this is , again , we could have been here with a different outcome , \u201d she said .     \u201cthey followed through with the procedures and protocols we have in place in making sure that we keep our children safe . what i want to say to parents is everyone at school today is still safe , they will be safe again tomorrow , they are going to be safe throughout because we do have procedures in place to keep children safe , \u201d byrd added .     byrd urged parents to monitor their children ' s online activity to see what they may be purchasing .     \u201cthe sheriff and i have a partnership and we have a commitment to keeping our campuses and our children safe , \u201d byrd said .     the children suffered stomachaches , dizziness , and one of them had almost passed
