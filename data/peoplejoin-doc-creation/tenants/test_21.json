there should have been a railing to catch him .     and so it was that louis helmburg iii joined forces with timothy p. rosinsky , esq. , a slip-and-fall lawyer from huntington who had experience also with dog-bite , dui , car-repossession , and drug cases . the events of that night , laid out in helmburg \u2019 s complaint , suggested a relatively straightforward lawsuit . but the suit would turn out to have its own repeated failures to launch and unintended collateral damage , and it would include an ever-widening and desperate search for potential defendants willing to foot the modest bill for helmburg \u2019 s documented injuries . sending a lawyer without special expertise in wrangling with fraternities to sue one of them is like sending a boy scout to sort out the unpleasantness in afghanistan . who knows ? the kid could get lucky . but it never hurts \u2014 preparedness and all that \u2014 to send him off with a body bag .     related story 18 u.s. presidents were frat boys \" fraternity men make up 85 percent of u.s. supreme court justices since 1910 , 63 percent of all u.s. presidential cabinet members since 1900 , and , historically , 76 percent of u.s. senators and 85 percent of fortune 500 executives ... fraternities really do breed leaders \u2014 a cohort of young men dedicated to being loyal , being knowledgeable , and embracing the skills of leadership success . \" read the full story by maria konnikova     college fraternities \u2014 by which term of art i refer to the formerly all-white , now nominally integrated men \u2019 s \u201cgeneral \u201d or \u201csocial \u201d fraternities , and not the several other types of fraternities on american campuses ( religious , ethnic , academic ) \u2014 are as old , almost , as the republic . in a sense , they are older : they emanated in part from the freemasons , of which george washington himself was a member . when arguments are made in their favor , they are arguments in defense of a foundational experience for millions of american young men , and of a system that helped build american higher education as we know it . fraternities also provide their members with matchless leadership training . while the system has produced its share of poets , aesthetes , and henry james scholars , it is far more famous for its success in the powerhouse fraternity fields of business , law , and politics . an astonishing number of ceos of fortune 500 companies , congressmen and male senators , and american presidents have belonged to fraternities . many more thousands of american men count their fraternal experience \u2014 and the friendships made within it \u2014 as among the most valuable in their lives . the organizations raise millions of dollars for worthy causes , contribute millions of hours in community service , and seek to steer young men toward lives of service and honorable action . they also have a long , dark history of violence against their own members and visitors to their houses , which makes them in many respects at odds with the core mission of college itself .     lawsuits against fraternities are becoming a growing matter of public interest , in part because they record such lurid events , some of them ludicrous , many more of them horrendous . for every butt bomb , there \u2019 s a complaint of manslaughter , rape , sexual torture , psychological trauma . a recent series of articles on fraternities by bloomberg news \u2019 s david glovin and john hechinger notes that since 2005 , more than 60 people \u2014 the majority of them students \u2014 have died in incidents linked to fraternities , a sobering number in itself , but one that is dwarfed by the numbers of serious injuries , assaults , and sexual crimes that regularly take place in these houses . many people believe that violent hazing is the most dangerous event associated with fraternity life , but hazing causes a relatively small percentage of these injuries . because of a variety of forces , all this harm \u2014 and the behaviors that lead to it \u2014 has lately been moving out of the shadows of private disciplinary hearings and silent suffering , and into the bright light of civil lawsuits , giving us a clear picture of some of the more forbidding truths about fraternity life . while many of these suits never make it to trial , disappearing into confidential settlements ( as did that of louis helmburg iii , nearly two years after he filed his lawsuit ) or melting away once plaintiffs recognize the powerful and monolithic forces they are up against , the narratives they leave behind in their complaints \u2014 all of them matters of public record \u2014 comprise a rich and potent testimony to the kinds of experiences regularly taking place on college campuses . tellingly , the material facts of these complaints are rarely in dispute ; what is contested , most often , is only liability .     far from being freakish and unpredictable events , fatal and near-fatal falls from fraternity-house roofs , balconies , windows , and sleeping porches are fairly regular occurrences across the country .     i have spent most of the past year looking deeply into the questions posed by these lawsuits , and more generally into the particular nature of fraternity life on the modern american campus . much of what i found challenged my beliefs about the system , assumptions that i came to see as grossly outdated , not because the nature of fraternity life has changed so much , but rather because life at the contemporary university has gone through such a profound transformation in the past quarter century . i found that the ways in which the system exerts its power \u2014 and maintains its longevity \u2014 in the face of the many potentially antagonistic priorities in contemporary higher education commanded my grudging respect . fraternity tradition at its most essential is rooted in a set of old , deeply american , morally unassailable convictions , some of which \u2014 such as a young man \u2019 s right to the freedom of association \u2014 emanate from the constitution itself . in contrast , much of the policy governing college campuses today is rooted in the loose soil of a set of political and social fashions that change with the season , and that tend not to hold up to any kind of penetrating challenge . and this is why \u2014 to answer the vexing question \u201cwhy don \u2019 t colleges just get rid of their bad fraternities ? \u201d \u2014 the system , and its individual frats , have only grown in power and influence . indeed , in many substantive ways , fraternities are now mightier than the colleges and universities that host them .     the entire multibillion-dollar , 2,000-campus american college system \u2014 with its armies of salaried professors , administrators , librarians , bursars , secretaries , admissions officers , alumni liaisons , development-office workers , coaches , groundskeepers , janitors , maintenance workers , psychologists , nurses , trainers , technology-support staffers , residence-life personnel , cafeteria workers , diversity-compliance officers , the whole shebang \u2014 depends overwhelmingly for its very existence on one resource : an ever-renewing supply of fee-paying undergraduates . it could never attract hundreds of thousands of them each year \u2014 many of them woefully unprepared for the experience , a staggering number ( some 40 percent ) destined never to get a degree , more than 60 percent of them saddled with student loans that they very well may carry with them to their deathbeds \u2014 if the experience were not accurately marketed as a blast . they show up on campus lugging enormous bed bath &amp; beyond bags crammed with \u201cessentials , \u201d and with new laptop computers , on which they will surf facebook and tumblr while some coot down at the lectern bangs on about maslow \u2019 s hierarchy and tries to make his powerpoint slides appear right side up . many of these consumer goods have been purchased with money from the very student loans that will haunt them for so long , but no matter : it \u2019 s college ; any cost can be justified . the kids arrive eager to hurl themselves upon the pasta bars and the climbing walls , to splash into the 12-person jacuzzis and lounge around the outdoor fire pits , all of which have been constructed in a blatant effort to woo them away from competitors . they swipe prepaid cards in dormitory vending machines to acquire whatever tanning wipes or earbuds or condoms or lube or energy drinks the occasion seems to require . and every moment of the experience is sweetened by the general understanding that with each kegger and rager , each lazy afternoon spent snoozing on the quad ( a forgotten highlighter slowly drying out on the open pages of introduction to economics , a coke zero sweating beside it ) , they are actively engaged in the most significant act of self-improvement available to an american young person : college !     phil toledano     that all of this fun is somehow as essential as the education itself \u2014 is somehow part of a benevolent and ultimately edifying process of \u201cgrowing up \u201d \u2014 is one of the main reasons so many parents who are themselves in rocky financial shape will make economically ruinous decisions to support a four-year-residential-college experience for their children . there are many thousands of american undergraduates whose economic futures ( and those of their parents ) would be far brighter if they knocked off some of their general-education requirements online , or at the local community college \u2014 for pennies on the dollar \u2014 before entering the weimar republic of traditional-college pricing . but college education , like weddings and funerals , tends to prompt irrational financial decision making , and so here we are . add another pesto flavor to the pasta bar , dean roland ! we just lost another kid to online ed !     that pursuing a bachelor \u2019 s degree might be something other than a deeply ascetic and generally miserable experience was once a preposterous idea . american colleges came into being with the express purpose of training young men for the ministry , a preparation that was marked by a chilly round of early risings , greek and latin recitations , religious study , and strict discipline meted out by a dour faculty \u2014 along with expectations of both temperance and chastity . hardly conditions that would augur the current trillion-dollar student-loan balloon that hovers over us like a pre-ignition hindenburg . but sexual frustration and homiletics would not last forever as the hallmarks of american college life .     related story i fought back against my college ' s sexist fraternity \" i was taken aback by the fact that these women would openly acknowledge what i thought we were too old to admit in college : these men were popular . and that made them powerful . and if we rocked the boat , we could be shunned . \" read the full story by meghan mccarthy     in 1825 , at union college , in upstate new york ( hardly a garden of earthly delights in the best of circumstances , but surely a gulag experience for those stuck at union ; imagine studying thessalonians in the ass-cracking cold of a schenectady february ) , a small group of young men came up with a creative act of rebellion against the fun-busters who had them down : the formation of a secret club , which they grandly named the kappa alpha society . word of the group spread , and a new kind of college institution was founded , and with it a brand-new notion : that going to college could include some pleasure . it was the american age of societies , and this new type fit right in . as nicholas syrett observes in his excellent history of white men \u2019 s college fraternities , the company he keeps , these early fraternities were in every way a measure of their time . they combined the secret handshakes and passwords of small boys \u2019 clubs ; the symbols and rituals of freemasonry ; the new national interest in greek , as opposed to roman , culture as a model for an emerging citizenry ; and the popularity of literary societies , elements of which \u2013 oratory , recitation , and the presentation of essays \u2014 the early fraternities included . fraternities also gave young college men a way of behaving and of thinking about themselves that quickly took on surprisingly modern dimensions . an 1857 letter that a sigma phi member named jenkins holland sent to one of his fraternity brothers suggests the new system was already hitting full stride : \u201ci did get one of the nicest pieces of ass some day or two ago. \u201d     from the very beginning , fraternities were loathed by the grown-ups running colleges , who tried to banish them . but independence from overbearing faculties \u2014 existing on a plane beyond the reach of discipline \u2014 was , in large measure , the point of fraternity membership ; far from fearing the opprobrium of their knock-kneed overlords , the young men relished and even courted it . when colleges tried to shut them down , fraternities asserted that any threat to men \u2019 s membership in the clubs constituted an infringement of their right to freedom of association . it was , at best , a legally delicate argument , but it was a symbolically potent one , and it has withstood through the years . the powerful and well-funded political-action committee that represents fraternities in washington has fought successfully to ensure that freedom-of-association language is included in all higher-education reauthorization legislation , thus \u201cdisallowing public universities the ability to ban fraternities. \u201d     an 1857 letter that a sigma phi sent to one of his fraternity brothers suggests the new system was already hitting full stride : \u201ci did get one of the nicest pieces of ass some day or two ago. \u201d     perhaps the best testament to the deep power of fraternities is how quickly and widely they spread . soon after gold rush money began flowing into the newly established state of california \u2014 giving rise to the improbable idea of building a great american university on the shores of the pacific ocean \u2014 fraternity men staked their own claim : a campus in berkeley had existed barely a year before the brothers of phi delta theta arrived to initiate new members . the thing to remember about fraternities is that when kappa alpha was founded at union , in all of the united states there were only 4,600 college students ; fraternities exist as deeply in the groundwater of american higher education as religious study \u2014 and have retained a far greater presence in the lives of modern students .     in fairly short order , a paradox began to emerge , one that exists to this day . while the fraternities continued to exert their independence from the colleges with which they were affiliated , these same colleges started to develop an increasingly bedeviling kind of interdependence with the accursed societies . to begin with , the fraternities involved themselves very deeply in the business of student housing , which provided tremendous financial savings to their host institutions , and allowed them to expand the number of students they could admit . today , one in eight american students at four-year colleges lives in a greek house , and a conservative estimate of the collective value of these houses across the country is $ 3 billion . greek housing constitutes a troubling fact for college administrators ( the majority of fraternity-related deaths occur in and around fraternity houses , over which the schools have limited and widely varying levels of operational oversight ) and also a great boon to them ( saving them untold millions of dollars in the construction and maintenance of campus-owned and -controlled dormitories ) .     reader responses excerpts from comments posted to this story : \" my perspective as a fraternity member and former president of a 120 man chapter at a public university in the midwest : fraternity houses are inherently dangerous and fraternity houses are a hell of a lot of fun . \"     \u2014 valyrian steel \" like peter pan trying to corral the lost boys , the job of fraternity president and his team is incredibly difficult and one that illuminates the arguments for and against the fraternity system . \"     \u2014 joe \" reform of the drinking laws would help the problems explored in this article a lot more than any realistic attack on the free association rights of young adults . \"     \u2014 c.m . \" this is a good article about why lawyers are horrible and destroy everything enjoyable in society . \"     \u2014 greghood read all comments     moreover , fraternities tie alumni to their colleges in a powerful and lucrative way . at least one study has affirmed what had long been assumed : that fraternity men tend to be generous to their alma maters . furthermore , fraternities provide colleges with unlimited social programming of a kind that is highly attractive to legions of potential students , most of whom are not applying to ivy-covered rejection factories , but rather to vast public institutions and obscure private colleges that are desperate for students . when mom is trying \u2014 against all better judgment \u2014 to persuade lackluster joe jr. to go to college , she gets a huge assist when she drives him over to state and he gets an eyeful of frat row . joe jr. may be slow to grasp even the most elemental concepts of math and english ( his first two years of expensive college study will largely be spent in remediation of the subjects he should have learned , for free , in high school ) , but one look at the fiji house and he gets the message : kids are getting laid here ; kids are having fun . maybe he ought to snuff out the joint and take a second look at that application mom keeps pushing across the kitchen table .     will he be in increased physical jeopardy if he joins one of these clubs ? the fraternity industry says no . when confronted with evidence of student injury and death in their houses , fraternities claim they are no worse than any other campus group ; that they have become \u201ctarget defendants , \u201d prey to the avarice of tort lawyers excited by their many assets and extensive liability coverage . it is true that fraternity lawsuits tend to involve at least one , and often more , of the four horsemen of the student-life apocalypse , a set of factors that exist far beyond frat row and that are currently bringing college presidents to their knees . first and foremost of these is the binge-drinking epidemic , which anyone outside the problem has a hard time grasping as serious ( everyone drinks in college ! ) and which anyone with knowledge of the current situation understands as a lurid and complicated disaster . the second is the issue of sexual assault of female undergraduates by their male peers , a subject of urgent importance but one that remains stubbornly difficult even to quantify , let alone rectify , although it absorbs huge amounts of student interest , outrage , institutional funding , and \u2014 increasingly \u2014 federal attention . the third is the growing pervasiveness of violent hazing on campus , an art form that reaches its apogee at fraternities , but that has lately spread to all sorts of student groups . and the fourth is the fact that boomers , who in their own days destroyed the doctrine of in loco parentis so that they could party in blissful , unsupervised freedom , have grown up into the helicopter parents of today , holding fiercely to a pair of mutually exclusive desires : on the one hand that their kids get to experience the same unfettered personal freedoms of college that they remember so fondly , and on the other that the colleges work hard to protect the physical and emotional well-being of their precious children .     but it \u2019 s impossible to examine particular types of campus calamity and not find that a large number of them cluster at fraternity houses . surely they have cornered the market in injuries to the buttocks . the number of lawsuits that involve paddling gone wrong , or branding that necessitated skin grafts , or a particular variety of sexual torture reserved for hazing and best not described in the gentle pages of this magazine , is astounding . to say nothing of the university of tennessee frat boy who got dropped off , insensate , at the university hospital \u2019 s emergency room and was originally assumed to be the victim of a sexual assault , and only later turned out to have damaged his rectum by allegedly pumping wine into it through an enema hose , as had his pals .     or , to turn away from the buttocks , as surely a good number of fraternity men would be well advised to do , consider another type of fraternity injury : the tendency of brothers and their guests to get liquored up and fall off \u2014 or out of \u2014 the damn houses is a story in itself .     the campuses of washington state university and the university of idaho are located some eight miles apart in the vast agricultural region of the northwest known as the palouse . it was at the latter institution that the 19-year-old sophomore and newly minted delta delta delta pledge amanda andaverde arrived in august of 2009 , although she had scarcely moved into the tri delta house and registered for classes before she was at the center of events that would leave her with brain damage and cast her as the plaintiff in a major lawsuit filed on her behalf by her devastated parents .     it would have been an unremarkable wednesday evening \u2014 focused on the kind of partying and hooking up that are frequent pleasures of modern sorority women \u2014 save for its hideous end . andaverde and her sorority sisters began the night at sigma chi , where the \u201csorority ladies \u201d drank alcohol and spent the evening with \u201cdates \u201d they had been assigned during a party game . ( the language of andaverde \u2019 s legal complaint often seems couched in a combination of \u2019 50s lingo and polite euphemism , intended perhaps to preclude a conservative idaho jury from making moralistic judgments about the plaintiff \u2019 s behavior. ) the charms of andaverde \u2019 s assigned date ran thin , apparently , because close to midnight , she left him and made her way over to the sigma alpha epsilon house , where she quickly ended up on the third-floor sleeping porch .     many fraternity houses , especially older ones , have sleeping porches \u2014 sometimes called \u201ccold airs \u201d or \u201crack rooms \u201d \u2014 typically located on the top floor of the buildings \u2019 gable ends . they are large rooms filled with bunks , some of which are stacked in triple tiers , and their large windows are often left open , even in the coldest months . many fraternity members have exceedingly fond memories of their time on the porches , which they view \u2014 like so many fraternity traditions \u2014 as a simultaneously vexing and bonding experience . although these group sleeping arrangements were once considered an impediment to a young man \u2019 s sex life , the hookup culture , in which privacy is no longer a requirement of sexual activity , has changed that , and the sleeping-porch experience is once again coming into favor . for a variety of reasons , sleeping porches feature in a number of lawsuits , pointing to an astonishing fact : despite fraternity houses \u2019 position as de facto residence halls for so many american college students , safety features are decidedly spotty ; about half of them don \u2019 t even have fire sprinklers .     that pursuing a bachelor \u2019 s degree might be something other than a deeply ascetic and generally miserable experience was once a preposterous idea .     according to the complaint , shortly after arriving at sae , andaverde ran into a friend of hers , and he took her up to the sleeping porch , where he introduced her to a pal of his named joseph cody cook . andaverde and cook talked , then climbed into cook \u2019 s bunk , where the two began kissing . it is at this point that the language of the suit finally frees itself of euphemism and reveals the fearsome power of the unambiguous , declarative sentence : \u201camanda rolled onto her shoulder toward the exterior wall , and suddenly , quickly , and unexpectedly dropped off cook \u2019 s mattress into the open exterior window , falling from the third-floor \u2018sleeping porch \u2019 to the cement approximately 25 feet below. \u201d     the injuries were devastating and included permanent brain injury . andaverde was airlifted to a trauma center in seattle , where she remained for many weeks ; in the early days of her care , it seemed she might not survive . eventually , however , she improved enough to leave the hospital and was transferred to a series of rehabilitation centers , where she spent many months learning to regain basic functions . police , interviewed about the case , defended themselves the way police departments in college towns all over the country reasonably defend themselves when accused of not preventing a fraternity-house disaster : \u201cwe just can \u2019 t send undercover people into private houses or private parties , \u201d said david duke , the moscow , idaho , assistant chief of police .     local news outlets covered andaverde \u2019 s plight widely and sympathetically , although the optimism with which her \u201cmiraculous \u201d recovery was celebrated was perhaps exaggerated . a television news report dedicated to that miracle revealed a young woman who , while she had escaped death , had clearly been grievously injured . as the reporter interviewed her mother , andaverde sat in a wheelchair . when her hands were not propped on a black lap tray latched to the chair , she struggled to grasp a crayon and run it across the pages of a children \u2019 s coloring book , or to place the six large pieces of a simple puzzle \u2014 square , triangle , circle \u2014 into their spaces . she eventually improved from this desperate state \u2014 learning to walk and dress herself \u2014 but she was a far cry from the student of veterinary medicine she had once been .     the local inclinations to see a badly injured college student as a figure deserving of community support , and to view even a limited recovery as evidence of the goodness of god , are not unaligned with regional preferences for self-reliance and for taking responsibility for one \u2019 s own actions , however dire the consequences . the inevitable court case \u2014 in which the andaverde family named not only sae and tri delta as defendants , but also the university of idaho and the idaho state board of education \u2014 was dismissed on summary judgment because there was no dispute that andaverde fell out of an open window , and because there was no evidence of an inherently dangerous condition in the house : that the window was open was obvious to anyone who walked into the room . the court determined that no other person or institution had a duty to protect amanda from the actions and decisions \u2014 the decision to drink alcohol , as a minor ; the decision to climb into a bunk bed ; the impulse to roll over \u2014 that led to her accident .     phil toledano     andaverde \u2019 s case seemed to me to be an isolated tragedy , until i sent away to the latah county courthouse for a copy of the complaint and discovered within it this sentence : \u201camanda \u2019 s fall was the second fall of a student from an upper-story fraternity house window at the university of idaho within approximately a two-week period. \u201d this struck me as an astonishing coincidence . i looked into the matter and found that , indeed , a 20-year-old man named shane meyer had fallen from the third-floor window of the delta tau delta house just 12 days before andaverde \u2019 s fall from sae ; not surprisingly , the police reported that \u201calcohol may have been a factor. \u201d he , too , had been airlifted to seattle , and incredibly , the two fought for their lives in the same critical-care unit at harborview medical center . i became intrigued by this kind of injury and began to do some more checking into the subject . i discovered that two months after andaverde \u2019 s fall , a 20-year-old student at washington state \u2014 \u201cquite intoxicated , \u201d in the laconic assessment of a local cop \u2014 pitched forward and fell from a third-floor window of alpha kappa lambda , escaping serious injury when his fall was broken by an suv parked below . that these three events were not greeted on either campus by any kind of clamoring sense of urgency \u2014 that they were , rather , met with a resigned sort of \u201chere we go again \u201d attitude by campus administrators and with what appeared to be the pro forma appointment of an investigative task force \u2014 sparked my interest , and so it was that i entered the bizarre world of falls from fraternity houses , which , far from being freakish and unpredictable events , are in fact fairly regular occurrences across the country .     during the 2012 \u2013 13 school year on the palouse \u2014 where students from the two campuses often share apartments and attend parties at each other \u2019 s schools \u2014 the falls continued . in september , a student suffered serious injuries after falling off the roof of the alpha tau omega house at the university of idaho , and two days later a washington state student fell three stories from a window at phi kappa tau . in november , a 19-year-old suffered critical head injuries when he fell backwards off a second-floor balcony at the washington state lambda chi alpha house , necessitating the surgical removal of part of his skull . in april , a university of idaho student named krysta huft filed a suit against the delta chi fraternity , seeking damages for a broken pelvis resulting from a 2011 fall , which she claims was from the house \u2019 s third-story sleeping porch onto a basketball court beneath it .     i decided to widen my search , and quickly discovered that this is not a phenomenon particular to the northwest . across the country , kids fall \u2014 disastrously \u2014 from the upper heights of fraternity houses with some regularity . they tumble from the open windows they are trying to urinate out of , slip off roofs , lose their grasp on drainpipes , misjudge the width of fire-escape landings . on february 25 , 2012 , a student at the university of california at berkeley attempted to climb down the drainpipe of the phi gamma delta house , fell , and suffered devastating injuries ; on april 14 of the same year , a 21-year-old student at gannon university , in pennsylvania , died after a fall from the second-floor balcony of the alpha phi delta house the night before ; on may 13 , a cornell student was airlifted to a trauma center after falling from the fire escape at delta chi ; on october 13 , a student at james madison university fell from the roof of the three-story delta chi house and was airlifted to the university of virginia hospital ; on december 1 , a 19-year-old woman fell eight feet from the sigma alpha mu house at penn state .     this summer brought little relief . on july 13 , a man fell more than 30 feet from a third-story window at the theta delta chi house at the university of washington and was transported to harborview medical center ( which must by now be developing a subspecialty in such injuries ) ; that same day , a dartmouth college employee , apparently having consumed lsd and marijuana , fell out of a second-story window of the sigma nu house and was seriously injured . on august 13 , a student at the university of oklahoma fell face-first off a balcony of the sae house ; the next day , a woman fell from a second-story fire escape at phi kappa tau at washington state university .     the current school year began , and still the falls continued . in september , a student at washington state fell down a flight of stairs in the delta chi house and was rendered unconscious ; a university of minnesota student was hospitalized after falling off a second-floor balcony of the phi kappa psi house ; a northwestern student was listed in critical condition after falling out of a third-floor window of the phi gamma delta house ; and an mit student injured his head and genitals after falling through a skylight at the phi sigma kappa house and landing some 40 feet below .     these falls , of course , are in addition to the many other kinds of havoc and tragedy associated with fraternities . on the palouse , such incidents include the january 2013 death of 18-year-old joseph wiederrick , a university of idaho freshman who had made the dean \u2019 s list his first semester , and who had plans to become an architect . he had attended a party at sae ( of which he was not a member ) and then wandered , apparently drunk and lost , for five miles before freezing to death under a bridge . they also include the march 2013 conviction of jesse m. vierstra , who , while visiting sigma chi over the university of idaho \u2019 s homecoming weekend , raped an 18-year-old freshman in the bushes outside the house . ( he is appealing the decision. )     the notion that fraternities are target defendants did not hold true in my investigation . college students can ( and do ) fall out of just about any kind of residence , of course . but during the period of time under consideration , serious falls from fraternity houses on the two palouse campuses far outnumbered those from other types of student residences , including privately owned apartments occupied by students . i began to view amanda andaverde \u2019 s situation in a new light . why are so many colleges allowing students to live and party in such unsafe locations ? and why do the lawsuits against fraternities for this kind of serious injury and death \u2014 so predictable and so preventable \u2014 have such a hard time getting traction ? the answers lie in the recent history of fraternities and the colleges and universities that host them .     from the archives the hazards of duke \" with a social scene dominated by fraternities and sororities ( a way of life consisting of ardent partying and hooking up , offset by spurts of busywork composing angry letters to campus newspapers and taking online alcohol-education classes ) , ... [ duke ] is a university whose thoughtful students are overshadowed by its voraciously self-centered ones . \" read the full story by caitlin flanagan in the jan/feb 2011 issue .     what all of these lawsuits ultimately concern is a crucially important question in higher education , one that legal scholars have been grappling with for the past half century . this question is perhaps most elegantly expressed in the subtitle of robert d. bickel and peter f. lake \u2019 s authoritative 1999 book on the subject , the rights and responsibilities of the modern university : who assumes the risks of college life ?     the answer to this question has been steadily evolving ever since the 1960s , when dramatic changes took place on american campuses , changes that affected both a university \u2019 s ability to control student behavior and the status of fraternities in the undergraduate firmament . during this period of student unrest , the fraternities \u2014 long the unquestioned leaders in the area of sabotaging or ignoring the patriarchal control of school administrators \u2014 became the exact opposite : representatives of the very status quo the new activists sought to overthrow . suddenly their beer bashes and sorority mixers , their panty raids and obsession with the big game , seemed impossibly reactionary when compared with the mind-altering drugs being sampled in off-campus apartments where sexual liberation was being born and the little red book proved , if nothing else , a fantastic coaster for a leaky bong .     american students sought to wrest themselves entirely from the disciplinary control of their colleges and universities , institutions that had historically operated in loco parentis , carefully monitoring the private behavior of undergraduates . the students of the new era wanted nothing to do with that infantilizing way of existence , and fought to rid themselves of the various curfews , dorm mothers , demerit systems , and other modes of institutional oppression . if they were old enough to die in vietnam , powerful enough to overthrow a president , groovy enough to expand their minds with lsd and free love , then they certainly didn \u2019 t need their own colleges \u2014 the very places where they were forming their radical , nation-changing ideas \u2014 to treat them like teenyboppers in need of a sock hop and a chaperone . it was a turning point : american colleges began to regard their students not as dependents whose private lives they must shape and monitor , but as adult consumers whose contract was solely for an education , not an upbringing . the doctrine of in loco parentis was abolished at school after school . through it all , fraternities \u2014 for so long the repositories of the most outrageous behavior \u2014 moldered , all but forgotten . membership fell sharply , fraternity houses slid into increasing states of disrepair , and hundreds of chapters closed .     animal house , released in 1978 , at once predicted and to no small extent occasioned the roaring return of fraternity life that began in the early \u2019 80s and that gave birth to today \u2019 s vital greek scene . the casting of john belushi was essential to the movie \u2019 s influence : no one had greater credibility in the post- \u2019 60s youth culture . if something as fundamentally reactionary as fraternity membership was going to replace something as fundamentally radical as student unrest , it would need to align itself with someone whose bona fides among young , white , middle-class males were unassailable . in this newly forming culture , the drugs and personal liberation of the \u2019 60s would be paired with the self-serving materialism of the \u2019 80s , all of which made partying for its own sake \u2014 and not as a philosophical adjunct to solving some complicated problem in southeast asia \u2014 a righteous activity for the pampered young collegian . fraternity life was reborn with a vengeance .     it was an entirely new kind of student who arrived at the doors of those great and crumbling mansions : at once deeply attracted to the ceremony and formality of fraternity life and yet utterly transformed by the social revolutions of the past decades . these new members and their countless guests brought with them hard drugs , new and ever-developing sexual attitudes , and a stunningly high tolerance for squalor ( never had middle- and upper-middle-class american young people lived in such filth as did \u2019 60s and \u2019 70s college kids who were intent on rejecting their parents \u2019 bourgeois ways ) . furthermore , in 1984 congress passed the national minimum drinking age act , with the ultimate result of raising the legal drinking age to 21 in all 50 states . this change moved college partying away from bars and college-sponsored events and toward private houses \u2014 an ideal situation for fraternities . when these advances were combined with the evergreen fraternity traditions of violent hazing and brawling among rival frats , the scene quickly became wildly dangerous .     adult supervision was nowhere to be found . colleges had little authority to intervene in what took place in the personal lives of its students visiting private property . fraternities , eager to provide their members with the independence that is at the heart of the system \u2014 and responsive to members \u2019 wish for the same level of freedom that non-greek students enjoyed \u2014 had largely gotten rid of the live-in resident advisers who had once provided some sort of check on the brothers . with these conditions in place , lawsuits began to pour in .     no sooner has a national fraternity rolled out a new \u201cmen of principle \u201d or \u201ctrue gentlemen \u201d campaign than reports of a lurid disaster in some prominent or far-flung chapter undermine the whole thing .     the mid-1980s were a treacherous time to be the defendant in a tort lawsuit . personal-injury cases had undergone a long shift to the plaintiff \u2019 s advantage ; the theory of comparative negligence \u2014 by which an individual can acknowledge his or her own partial responsibility for an injury yet still recover damages from a defendant \u2014 had become the standard ; the era of huge jury verdicts was at hand . americans in vast numbers \u2014 motivated perhaps in part by the possibility of financial recompense , and in part by a new national impetus to move personal suffering from the sphere of private sorrow to that of public confession and complaint \u2014 began to sue those who had damaged them . many fraternity lawsuits listed the relevant college or university among the defendants , a practice still common among less experienced plaintiff \u2019 s attorneys . these institutions possess deep reservoirs of liability coverage , but students rarely recover significant funds from their schools . as amanda andaverde \u2019 s attorneys discovered the hard way , a great deal of time and money can be spent seeking damages from institutions of higher learning , which can be protected by everything from sovereign immunity and damage caps ( in the case of public universities ) , to their limited ability to monitor the private behavior of their students . but for the fraternities themselves , it was a far different story .     so recently and robustly brought back to life , the fraternities now faced the most serious threat to their existence they had ever experienced . a single lawsuit had the potential to devastate a fraternity . in 1985 , a young man grievously injured in a kappa alpha \u2013 related accident reached a settlement with the fraternity that , over the course of his lifetime , could amount to some $ 21 million \u2014 a sum that caught the attention of everyone in the greek world . liability insurance became both ruinously expensive and increasingly difficult to obtain . the insurance industry ranked american fraternities as the sixth-worst insurance risk in the country \u2014 just ahead of toxic-waste-removal companies . \u201cyou guys are nuts , \u201d an insurance representative told a fraternity ceo in 1989 , just before canceling the organization \u2019 s coverage ; \u201cyou can \u2019 t operate like this much longer. \u201d     for fraternities to survive , they needed to do four separate but related things : take the task of acquiring insurance out of the hands of the local chapters and place it in the hands of the vast national organizations ; develop procedures and policies that would transfer as much of their liability as possible to outside parties ; find new and creative means of protecting their massive assets from juries ; and \u2014 perhaps most important of all \u2014 find a way of indemnifying the national and local organizations from the dangerous and illegal behavior of some of their undergraduate members . the way fraternities accomplished all of this is the underlying story in the lawsuits they face , and it is something that few members \u2014 and , i would wager , even fewer parents of members \u2014 grasp completely , comprising a set of realities you should absolutely understand in detail if your son ever decides to join a fraternity .     self-insurance was an obvious means for combating prohibitive insurance pricing and the widening reluctance to insure fraternities . in 1992 , four fraternities created what was first called the fraternity risk management trust , a vast sum of money used for reinsurance . today , 32 fraternities belong to this trust . in 2006 , a group of seven other fraternities bought their own insurance broker , james r. favor , which now insures many others . more important than self-insurance , however , was the development of a risk-management policy that would become \u2014 across these huge national outfits and their hundreds of individual chapters \u2014 the industry standard . this was accomplished by the creation of something called the fraternal information and programming group ( fipg ) , which in the mid-1980s developed a comprehensive risk-management policy for fraternities that is regularly updated . currently 32 fraternities are members of the fipg and adhere to this policy , or to their own even more rigorous versions . one fraternity expert told me that even non-fipg frats have similar policies , many based in large measure on fipg \u2019 s , which is seen as something of a blueprint . in a certain sense , you may think you belong to tau kappa epsilon or sigma nu or delta tau delta \u2014 but if you find yourself a part of life-changing litigation involving one of those outfits , what you really belong to is fipg , because its risk-management policy ( and your adherence to or violation of it ) will determine your fate far more than the vows you made during your initiation ritual \u2014 vows composed by long-dead men who had never even heard of the concept of fraternity insurance .     fipg regularly produces a risk-management manual \u2014 the current version is 50 pages \u2014 that lays out a wide range of ( optional ) best practices . if the manual were anna karenina , alcohol policy would be its farming reform : the buzz-killing subplot that quickly reveals itself to be an authorial obsession . for good reason : the majority of all fraternity insurance claims involve booze \u2014 i have read hundreds of fraternity incident reports , not one of which describes an event where massive amounts of alcohol weren \u2019 t part of the problem \u2014 and the need to manage or transfer risk presented by alcohol is perhaps the most important factor in protecting the system \u2019 s longevity . any plaintiff \u2019 s attorney worth his salt knows how to use relevant social-host and dramshop laws against a fraternity ; to avoid this kind of liability , the fraternity needs to establish that the young men being charged were not acting within the scope of their status as fraternity members . once they violated their frat \u2019 s alcohol policy , they parted company with the frat . it \u2019 s a neat piece of logic : the very fact that a young man finds himself in need of insurance coverage is often grounds for denying it to him .     so : alcohol and the fraternity man . despite everything you may think you know about life on frat row , there are actually only two fipg-approved means of serving drinks at a frat party . the first is to hire a third-party vendor who will sell drinks and to whom some liability \u2014 most significant , that of checking whether drinkers are of legal age \u2014 will be transferred . the second and far more common is to have a byo event , in which the liability for each bottle of alcohol resides solely in the person who brought it . if you think this is in any way a casual system , then you have never read either the fipg risk-management manual or its sister publication , an essay written in the surrealist vein titled \u201cmaking bring your own beverage events happen. \u201d     the official byo system is like something dreamed up by a committee of soviet bureaucrats and irish nuns . it begins with the composition \u2014 no fewer than 24 hours before the party \u2014 of a comprehensive guest list . this guest list does not serve the happy function of ensuring a perfect mix of types and temperaments at the festivity ; rather , it limits attendance \u2014 and ensures that the frat is in possession of \u201ca witness list in the event something does occur which may end up in court two or more years later. \u201d provided a fraternity member \u2014 let \u2019 s call him larry \u2014 is older than 21 ( which the great majority of members , like the great majority of all college students , are not ) , he is allowed to bring six ( and no more ) beers or four ( and no more ) wine coolers to the party . ( fipg \u2019 s admiration for the wine-cooler four-pack suggests that at least some aspects of the foundational document \u2014 including its recommendation for throwing a m*a*s*h-themed party as recently as 2007 \u2014 have not received much of an overhaul since its first edition , published in the mid\u2011 \u2019 80s. ) okay , so larry brings a six-pack . the first stop , depending on which fraternity he belongs to : a \u201csober check point , \u201d at which he is subjected to an examination . does he appear to have already consumed any alcohol ? is he in any way \u201cknown \u201d to have done so ? if he passes , he hands over his id for inspection . next he must do business with a \u201csober monitor. \u201d this person relieves him of the six-pack , hands him a ticket indicating the precise type of beer he brought , and ideally affixes a \u201cnon breakable except by cutting \u201d wristband to his person ; only then can larry retrieve his beers , one at a time , for his own personal consumption . if any are left over at the end of the party , his fraternity will secure them until the next day , when larry can be reunited with his unconsumed beers , unless his frat decided to \u201celiminate \u201d them overnight . weaknesses in the system include the fact that all of these people coming between larry and his beer \u2014 the sober monitors and id checkers and militarized barkeeps \u2014 are larry \u2019 s fraternity brothers , who are among his closest buddies and who have pledged him lifelong fealty during candlelit ceremonies rife with masonic mumbo jumbo and the fluttering language of 19th-century romantic friendship . note also that these policies make it possible for fraternities to be the one industry in the country in which every aspect of serving alcohol can be monitored and managed by people who are legally too young to drink it .     during a crisis , the questionnaires and honest accounts that fraternity members submit gratefully to their national organization may return to haunt many of the brothers .     clearly , a great number of fraternity members will , at some point in their undergraduate career , violate their frat \u2019 s alcohol policy regarding the six beers \u2014 and just as clearly , the great majority will never face any legal consequences for doing so . but when the inevitable catastrophes do happen , that policy can come to seem more like a cynical hoax than a real-world solution to a serious problem . when something terrible takes place \u2014 a young man plummets from a roof , a young woman is assaulted , a fraternity brother is subjected to the kind of sexual sadism that appears all too often in fraternity lawsuits \u2014 any small violation of policy can leave fraternity members twisting in the wind . consider the following scenario : larry makes a small , human-size mistake one night . instead of waiting for the slow drip of six warm beers , he brings a bottle of maker \u2019 s mark to the party , and \u2014 in the spirit of not being a weirdo or a dick \u2014 he shares it , at one point pouring a couple of ounces into the passing solo cup of a kid who \u2019 s running on empty and asks him for a shot . larry never sees the kid again that night \u2014 not many people do ; he ends up drinking himself to death in an upstairs bedroom . in the sad fullness of time , the night \u2019 s horror is turned into a lawsuit , in which larry becomes a named defendant . thanks in part to the guest/witness list , larry can be cut loose , both from the expensive insurance he was required to help pay for ( by dint of his dues ) as a precondition of membership , and from any legal defense paid for by the organization . what will happen to larry now ?     gentle reader , if you happen to have a son currently in a college fraternity , i would ask that you take several carbon dioxide \u2013 rich deep breaths from a paper bag before reading the next paragraph . i \u2019 ll assume you are sitting down . ready ?     \u201ci \u2019 ve recovered millions and millions of dollars from homeowners \u2019 policies , \u201d a top fraternal plaintiff \u2019 s attorney told me . for that is how many of the claims against boys who violate the strict policies are paid : from their parents \u2019 homeowners \u2019 insurance . as for the exorbitant cost of providing the young man with a legal defense for the civil case ( in which , of course , there are no public defenders ) , that is money he and his parents are going to have to scramble to come up with , perhaps transforming the family home into an atm to do it . the financial consequences of fraternity membership can be devastating , and they devolve not on the 18-year-old \u201cman \u201d but on his planning-for-retirement parents .     like the six-beer policy , the fraternal information and programming group \u2019 s chillingly comprehensive crisis-management plan was included in its manual for many years . but in 2013 , the plan suddenly disappeared from its pages . when asked why this was so , dave westol , a longtime fipg board member , said , \u201cmember organizations prefer to establish their own procedures , and therefore the section has been eliminated. \u201d however , many fraternities continue to rely on the group \u2019 s advice for in-house risk management , and it is well worth examining if you want to know what takes place in the hours following many fraternity disasters . as it is described in the two most recent editions that i was able to obtain ( 2003 and 2007 ) , the plan serves a dual purpose , at once benevolent and mercenary . the benevolent part is accomplished by the clear directive that injured parties are to receive immediate medical attention , and that all fraternity brothers who come into contact with the relevant emergency workers are to be completely forthright about what has taken place . and the rest ? the plans i obtained recommend six important steps :     1. in the midst of the horror , the chapter president takes immediate , commanding , and inspiring control of the situation : \u201cin times of stress , leaders step forward. \u201d     2. a call is made to the fraternity \u2019 s crisis hotline or the national headquarters , no matter the hour : \u201csomeone will be available . they would much rather hear about a situation from you at 3 : 27 a.m. than receive an 8 : 01 a.m. telephone call from a reporter asking for a comment about \u2018the situation involving your chapter at ____. \u2019 \u201d     3. the president closes the fraternity house to outsiders and summons all members back to the house : \u201cunorthodox situations call for unorthodox responses from leaders . most situations occur at night . therefore , be prepared to call a meeting of all members and all pledged members as soon as possible , even if that is at 3 a.m. \u201d     4. one member \u2014 who has already received extensive media training \u2014 is put in charge of all relations with the press , an entity fraternities view as biased and often unscrupulous . the appointed member should be prepared to present a concise , factual , and minimally alarming account of what took place . for example : \u201ca new member was injured at a social event. \u201d     5. in the case of the death of a guest or a member , fraternity brothers do not attempt direct contact with the deceased \u2019 s parents . this hideous task is to be left to the impersonal forces of the relevant professionals . ( i know of one family who did not know their son was in any kind of trouble until \u2014 many hours after his death , and probably long after his fraternity brothers had initiated the crisis-management protocol \u2014 their home phone rang and the caller id came up with the area code of their boy \u2019 s college and a single word : coroner ) . if the dead person was a fraternity member who lived in the house , his brothers should return any borrowed items to his room and temporarily relocate his roommate , if he had one . members may offer to pack up his belongings , but \u201cit is more likely the family will want to do this themselves. \u201d several empty boxes might thoughtfully be left outside the room for this purpose .     6. members sit tight until consultants from the national organization show up to take control of the situation and to walk them through the next steps , which often include the completion of questionnaires explaining exactly what happened and one-on-one interviews with the fraternity representatives . the anxious brothers are reminded to be completely honest and forthcoming in these accounts , and to tell the folks from national absolutely everything they know so that the situation can be resolved in the best possible manner .     as you should by now be able to see very clearly , the interests of the national organization and the individual members cleave sharply as this crisis-management plan is followed . those questionnaires and honest accounts \u2014 submitted gratefully to the grown-ups who have arrived , the brothers believe , to help them \u2014 may return to haunt many of the brothers , providing possible cause for separating them from the fraternity , dropping them from the fraternity \u2019 s insurance , laying the blame on them as individuals and not on the fraternity as the sponsoring organization . indeed , the young men who typically rush so gratefully into the open arms of the representatives from their beloved national \u2014 an outfit to which they have pledged eternal allegiance \u2014 would be far better served by not talking to them at all , by walking away from the chapter house as quickly as possible and calling a lawyer .     the financial consequences of fraternity membership can be devastating , and they devolve not on the 18-year-old \u201cman \u201d but on his planning-for-retirement parents .     so here is the essential question : in the matter of these disasters , are fraternities acting in an ethical manner , requiring good behavior from their members and punishing them soundly for bad or even horrific decisions ? or are they keeping a cool distance from the mayhem , knowing full well that misbehavior occurs with regularity ( \u201cmost events take place at night \u201d ) and doing nothing about it until the inevitable tragedy occurs , at which point they cajole members into incriminating themselves via a crisis-management plan presented as being in their favor ?     the opposing positions on this matter are held most forcefully and expressed most articulately by two men : douglas fierberg , the best plaintiff \u2019 s attorney in the country when it comes to fraternity-related litigation , and peter smithhisler , the ceo of the north-american interfraternity conference , a trade organization representing 75 fraternities , among them all 32 members of the fraternal information and programming group . in a parallel universe , the two men would be not adversaries but powerful allies , for they have much in common : both are robust midwesterners in the flush of vital middle age and at the zenith of their professional powers ; both possess more dark knowledge of college-student life and collegiate binge drinking than many , if not most , of the experts hired to study and quantify the phenomenon ; both have built careers devoted to the lives and betterment of young people . but two roads diverged in the yellow wood , and here we are . one man is an avenger , a gun for hire , a person constitutionally ill-prepared to lose a fight ; the other is a conciliator , a patient explainer , a man ever willing to lift the flap of his giant tent and welcome you inside . i have had long and wide-ranging conversations with both men , in which each put forth his perspective on the situation .     fierberg is a man of obvious and deep intelligence , comfortable \u2014 in the way of alpha-male litigators \u2014 with sharply correcting a fuzzy thought ; with using obscenities ; with speaking derisively , even contemptuously , of opponents . he is also the man i would run to as though my hair were on fire if i ever found myself in a legal battle with a fraternity , and so should you . in a year of reporting this story , i have not spoken with anyone outside of the fraternity system who possesses a deeper understanding of its inner workings ; its closely guarded procedures and money trails ; and the legal theories it has developed over the past three decades to protect itself , often very successfully , from lawsuits . fierberg speaks frequently and openly with the press , and because of this \u2014 and because of the reticence of senior members of the fraternity system to speak at length with meddlesome journalists \u2014 the media often reflect his attitude .     for all these reasons , fierberg is generally loathed by people at the top of the fraternity world , who see him as a money-hungry lawyer who has chosen to chase their particular ambulance , and whose professed zeal for reforming the industry is a sham : what he wants is his share of huge damages , not systemic changes that would cut off the money flow . but in my experience of him , this is simply not the case . sure , he has built a lucrative practice . but he is clearly passionate about his cause and the plight of the kids \u2014 some of them horribly injured , others dead \u2014 who comprise his caseload , along with their shattered parents .     \u201cuntil proven otherwise , \u201d fierberg told me in april of fraternities , \u201cthey all are very risky organizations for young people to be involved in. \u201d he maintains that fraternities \u201care part of an industry that has tremendous risk and a tremendous history of rape , serious injury , and death , and the vast majority share common risk-management policies that are fundamentally flawed . most of them are awash in alcohol . and most if not all of them are bereft of any meaningful adult supervision. \u201d as for the risk-management policies themselves : \u201cthey are primarily designed to take the nationals \u2019 fingerprints off the injury and deaths , and i don \u2019 t believe that they offer any meaningful provisions. \u201d the fraternity system , he argues , is \u201cthe largest industry in this country directly involved in the provision of alcohol to underage people. \u201d the crisis-management plans reveal that in \u201cthe foreseeable future \u201d there may be \u201cthe death or serious injury \u201d of a healthy young person at a fraternity function .     are fraternities acting in an ethical manner , requiring good behavior and punishing poor decisions ? or are they keeping a cool distance from the mayhem , knowing full well that it occurs with regularity ?     and then there is peter smithhisler , who is the senior fraternity man ne plus ultra : unfailingly , sometimes elaborately courteous ; careful in his choice of words ; unflappable ; and as unlikely to interrupt or drop the f-bomb on a respectful female journalist as he would be to join the communist party . he is the kind of man you would want on your side in a tough spot , the kind of man you would want mentoring your son through the challenging passage from late adolescence to young manhood . he believes that the fraternity experience at its best constitutes an appeal to a young man \u2019 s better angels : through service , leadership training , and accountability for mistakes , a brother can learn the valuable lessons he will need to become \u201ca better dad , a better teacher , a better engineer , a better pilot , a better \u2018insert career here. \u2019 \u201d spend some time talking with pete smithhisler , and you can go from refusing to allow your son to join a fraternity to demanding he do so . indeed , the day after i talked with him , i happened to be at a social gathering where i met two women whose sons had just graduated from college . \u201cthe fraternity was what saved him , \u201d one mother said with great feeling . her son had waited until sophomore year to rush , and freshman year he had been so lonely and unsure of himself that she had become deeply worried about him . but everything changed after he pledged . he had friends ; he was happy . when he \u2019 d had to have some surgery while at school , his brothers had visited him almost around the clock , bringing him food , keeping up his spirits , checking in with his doctors and charming his nurses . \u201cif only i could have gotten my son to join one , \u201d the other mom said , wistfully . \u201ci kept trying , but he wouldn \u2019 t do it. \u201d why had she wished he \u2019 d pledged a fraternity ? \u201che would have been so much more connected to the college , \u201d she said . \u201che would have had so many other opportunities. \u201d\n"}, {"url": "file://test/21/1/0", "title": "test/21/1/0", "content": "as hurricane irene swung north thursday , putting the washington region in its

billion in insured losses and possibly forcing the evacuation of parts of new york city , officials and forecasters said .     mayor michael bloomberg said a decision on evacuations would be made tomorrow for residents in areas including coney island , battery park city and parts of staten island .     irene , a category 3 major hurricane , is expected to grow larger as it moves toward north carolina \u2019 s outer banks this weekend before crashing into the northeast as early as aug. 28 , according to the national hurricane center track projection . the storm is 105 miles ( 169 kilometers ) east-northeast of nassau , the bahamas .     \u201cthis track is eerily similar to gloria , \u201d said chris hyde , a meteorologist with mda earthsat weather in gaithersburg , maryland . \u201cmillions are potentially going to be losing power from north carolina all the way up to new england. \u201d     irene may cause $ 13.9 billion in insured losses and $ 20 billion in overall

polytechnic state university in 2010 banned fraternities from recruiting newly arrived students .     right away , the north-american interfraternity conference , which represents 75 national fraternities , jumped in . the indianapolis-based trade group e-mailed and met with cal poly administrators , paid for a study that opposed the ban and spurred a three-year campaign by student leaders . it won , and the school lifted the restriction this year . one freshman , charlie ross , couldn \u2019 t be happier about the opportunity to join a fraternity right away instead of waiting three months .     \u201cyou \u2019 ve got a group of guys who watch out for you when you \u2019 re drinking , \u201d ross , 18 , said after unpacking his bags at freshman orientation on the san luis obispo campus .     related stories :     the university \u2019 s turnabout shows how the interfraternity conference is blocking an approach that some higher education leaders say can save lives : postponing recruitment of freshmen , who account for a disproportionate number of fraternity-related deaths . the conference has opposed proposals at dozens of colleges to delay recruiting by a semester or a year .     \u201cthese organizations were putting our freshmen at risk , \u201d said shirley tilghman , former president of princeton university , which prohibited fraternity recruiting of freshmen , starting in the fall of 2012 . \u201cthere is so much vulnerability in that first week , that first month as a freshman on a college campus -- of feeling lost . it leads to all kinds of decisions that you would not make if you had a little more time to find your way. \u201d     freshmen deaths     princeton students who belonged to fraternities , especially freshmen , were more likely to be hospitalized because of drinking , said tilghman , who stepped down as president in june . of 60 fraternity-related deaths nationwide since 2005 , 24 , or 40 percent , were of freshmen , according to data compiled by bloomberg .     universities often are susceptible to the interfraternity conference \u2019 s pressure to recruit freshmen because greek life appeals to applicants and many alumni donors remain loyal to their fraternities . only 80 of about 800 u.s. campuses with fraternities defer recruiting , according to the conference .     fraternity membership surged to 327,260 in 2011 from 253,148 in 2005. national fraternities and affiliated foundations generated $ 185 million in student dues and other revenue in 2010-2011 , up 24 percent from 2005-2006 , tax records show .     binge drinking     white male fraternity members drink more heavily than any other group on campus , and published research suggests that the youngest students are most likely to engage in binge drinking , according to aaron white , program director for college and underage drinking prevention research at the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism .     \u201cthe first couple of months of school are a particularly vulnerable time for students with regard to heavy drinking , \u201d white said . \u201cdelaying rush makes a lot of sense. \u201d     founded in 1909 , the interfraternity conference joined the industry \u2019 s political arm , known as fratpac , in fighting against a federal anti-hazing bill last year .     the group has stepped up advocacy on campuses , especially against recruiting restrictions . with its encouragement , fraternity leaders at case western reserve university in cleveland rejected a 2011 plan to defer recruiting freshmen . at the university of colorado at boulder , the conference backed fraternities \u2019 decision to operate without university recognition , reducing their access to campus facilities , rather than accept deferred recruitment and live-in advisers .     lawsuit threat     \u201cthe nic was not supportive \u201d of university rules , said deb coffin , colorado vice chancellor for student affairs .     the university of central florida this year lifted a recruitment moratorium , which had been prompted by excessive drinking at fraternities and sororities , after the interfraternity conference threatened to sue the school for violating students \u2019 freedom-of-association rights . the national group \u2019 s threat didn \u2019 t influence the university , said maribeth ehasz , a central florida vice president .     of the 24 fraternity-related freshman deaths since 2005 , 15 occurred during and after recruiting events , including hazing and initiation rituals .     at northern illinois university in dekalb , freshman david bogenberger died last year of alcohol poisoning after a fraternity initiation rite known as \u201cmom and dad \u2019 s night. \u201d with other pledges , bogenberger moved from room to room at the chapter house answering questions from members and downing vodka before passing out , court records show .     fraternity measures     fraternities have taken steps to protect students , including banning alcohol at recruiting events and supporting sanctions against violators , said peter smithhisler , president of the interfraternity conference .     while drinking deaths at fraternities are \u201cheartbreaking , \u201d many students drink too much , not just at fraternities , he said . keeping out freshmen merely puts a \u201cband-aid \u201d on a broader campus problem , he said . it also deprives freshmen of opportunities at fraternities for leadership , career networking and charitable work , he said .     \u201cit would be a travesty if the fraternity experience were not available for the development of these young men , \u201d smithhisler said . \u201cwe believe in the fraternity experience and its ability to really transform an undergraduate into better men , better citizens , better doctors , teachers , engineers. \u201d     fraternities \u2019 lifeblood     if colleges are allowed to restrict recruitment for a semester or a year , they could next extend the delay through sophomore year , or even shut down fraternities , as some liberal arts institutions have done , he said .     \u201crecruitment is the lifeblood for every chapter , \u201d smithhisler said .     carson starkey , whose death prompted the cal poly ban , hadn \u2019 t planned on joining a fraternity until he arrived at the public university of 19,000 on the central california coast . one out of six undergraduates there participate in greek life .     the clean-cut , curly-haired 18-year-old from austin , texas , knew no one on campus , and the opportunity to bond with fraternity brothers soon appealed to him . he chose to pledge sigma alpha epsilon , one of the largest fraternities , with chapters on almost 230 campuses in the u.s. and canada .     \u2018drink up \u2019     while it included other activities such as a scavenger hunt , much of sigma alpha epsilon \u2019 s initiation revolved around alcohol . after thanksgiving , fraternity members summoned starkey and 16 other pledges to the garage of an off-campus house for \u201cbrown bag night. \u201d tarps covered couches to protect them from vomit , according to court testimony . pledges sat in a circle , with a trash can at the center .     at 10 : 30 p.m. , each pledge was given a brown bag with cans and bottles of alcohol . \u201cdrink up , finish by midnight , \u201d said one upperclassman , according to court testimony .     starkey \u2019 s bag had two 24-ounce cans of steel reserve beer , a 16-ounce can of sparks alcoholic energy drink , and a fifth of rum he was to split with another pledge , one of several sigma alpha epsilon brothers who bought the liquor testified . pledges also shared a bottle of 151-proof everclear , which is 75.5 percent alcohol . as members chanted \u201cpuke and rally , \u201d starkey emptied his bag in 20 minutes , court records show .     dirty mattress     after starkey passed out , fraternity brothers debated whether to drive him to a hospital less than a mile away , members testified . they placed starkey in a car and removed his sigma alpha epsilon pin , so that doctors wouldn \u2019 t know he was at a fraternity event . then they changed their minds . rather than go to the hospital , they brought him back in the house and left him on a dirty mattress , according to court records and starkey \u2019 s mother , julia .     starkey died on dec. 2 , 2008 , 71 days after starting college . he had a blood-alcohol content of 0.44 , or about five times the legal limit , according to court testimony .     four fraternity brothers pleaded no contest to misdemeanor charges related to hazing . they were sentenced to jail terms ranging from 30 to 120 days .     the starkeys sued sigma alpha epsilon and several members for negligence , settling for at least $ 2.45 million , court records show .     sigma alpha epsilon is committed to \u201cproviding a meaningful , beneficial and safe experience \u201d for all members , the national fraternity said in a statement .     cal poly barred sigma alpha epsilon from campus until 2033 and considered eliminating fraternities . instead , it stepped up oversight and decided in 2010 to delay freshman recruiting until january , the school \u2019 s second quarter .     \u2018huge pushback \u2019     soon after the policy was announced , \u201cthere was a huge pushback \u201d from the fraternity industry , said stephan lamb , then the university \u2019 s associate director of student life .     smithhisler and other interfraternity conference executives visited the school in 2010 to ask administrators to rescind deferred recruitment .     \u201cthe hand-wringing has started \u201d among fraternity leaders about cal poly \u2019 s limits on recruitment , smithhisler wrote in a jan. 12 , 2011 , e-mail to lamb obtained through a request to the university under california \u2019 s open-records law .     the next month , the trade group sent industry experts to cal poly to conduct an in-depth assessment of the school \u2019 s greek system , according to university records . typically , universities request such an evaluation and pay an $ 8,000 fee . in this instance , the conference covered the cost .     stealing , drinking     the report was hardly flattering . the assessment , prepared by fraternity executives , college administrators and a social worker , called cal poly \u2019 s recruitment \u201cdehumanizing and superficial \u201d and said alcohol was \u201ca , and perhaps the , defining factor \u201d of greek life .     \u201chazing occurs in the men \u2019 s chapters , particularly physical/strength endurance , stealing and drinking , \u201d it said . \u201calcohol plays a major role in the cal poly fraternity/sorority experience , especially within fraternity life. \u201d     still , the report called for an end to deferred recruitment because it runs \u201ccounter to a student \u2019 s right to choose. \u201d the policy unfairly required fraternities , but not sororities , to postpone rush , according to the assessment .     the national group worked through students , too . andy farrell , who headed cal poly \u2019 s student fraternity group in 2010 , said smithhisler took him aside and \u201cmade it clear that the [ interfraternity conference ] stand is that deferred recruitment should not exist. \u201d     fighting rules     national fraternities urged their cal poly chapters to fight the new rule , said michael franceschi , another student leader at the time . when students organized , the conference supplied them with research and helped edit a paper arguing against deferred recruitment .     \u201cwe \u2019 d send them drafts of each section , \u201d said jason colombini , then a campus fraternity leader and now student body president . \u201cthey would tell us things to look into. \u201d colombini said he acted on his own initiative , not the interfraternity conference \u2019 s .     turnover at the top of cal poly aided the fraternity cause . jeffrey armstrong , who became cal poly \u2019 s president in 2011 , and keith humphrey , vice president for student affairs , sympathized with students \u2019 pleas , colombini said . unlike their predecessors , armstrong and humphrey had been in fraternities , and armstrong met his wife through his membership in alpha gamma rho .     in june , cal poly announced it would abolish deferred recruiting at its 17 fraternities . in return , fraternity members agreed to register their parties , undergo alcohol education and submit to periodic reviews . about $ 100,000 in higher fees from fraternity members will fund a new university position monitoring greek life .     \u2018more control \u2019     the university didn \u2019 t bow to fraternity pressure , humphrey said . it simply wanted fraternity and sorority recruitment on the same schedule . deferred recruiting isn \u2019

is considering joining a fraternity to perform community service .     waiting isn \u2019 t going to stop freshmen from drinking heavily , said grant caraway , a former star high school football
