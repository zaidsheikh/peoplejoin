"documenting hate tracking hate crimes and bias incidents     the california man accused of killing a 19-year-old university of pennsylvania student earlier this month is an avowed neo-nazi and a member of one of the most notorious extremist groups in the country , according to three people with knowledge of the man \u2019 s recent activities .     the man , samuel woodward , has been charged in orange county , california , with murdering blaze bernstein , who went missing in early january while visiting his family over winter break . prosecutors allege that woodward stabbed bernstein more than 20 times before burying his body in an orange county park where it was eventually discovered . the two men had attended high school together .     woodward , 20 , is set to be arraigned on feb. 2 and has not yet entered a plea . orange county prosecutors say they are examining the possibility that the killing was a hate crime \u2014 bernstein was jewish and openly gay \u2014 and some recent news reports have suggested that the alleged killer might hold far-right or even white supremacist political beliefs .     now , three people with detailed knowledge of woodward \u2019 s recent past have been able to shed more light on the young man \u2019 s extremist activities . they said woodward was a member of the atomwaffen division , an armed fascist group with the ultimate aim of overthrowing the u.s. government through the use of terrorism and guerrilla warfare . stay informed get propublica \u2019 s daily digest .     the organization , which celebrates hitler and charles manson , has been tied to four other murders and an elaborate bomb plot over the past eight months . experts who study right-wing extremist movements believe atomwaffen \u2019 s commitment to violence has made it one of the more dangerous groups to emerge from the new wave of white supremacists .     two of the three people who described woodward \u2019 s affiliations are friends of his ; the other is a former member of atomwaffen division .     propublica \u2019 s revelations about woodward \u2019 s background add a new element to a murder case that has attracted considerable local and national news coverage . but they also raise fresh concerns about groups like atomwaffen division , shadowy outfits of uncertain size that appear capable of genuine harm .     woodward joined the organization in early 2016 and later traveled to texas to attend atomwaffen meetings and a three-day training camp , which involved instruction in firearms , hand-to-hand combat , camping and survival skills , the former member said . propublica has obtained photographs of woodward at an outdoor atomwaffen meeting in the scrubby texas countryside . one of the photos depicts woodward and other members making straight-armed nazi salutes while wearing skull masks . in other pictures , woodward is unmasked and easily identifiable .     the young man is proficient with both handguns and assault rifles , according to one person who participated in the texas training and watched him shoot . that person also said that woodward helped organize a number of atomwaffen members in california .     social media posts and chat logs shared by woodward \u2019 s friends show that he openly described himself as a \u201cnational socialist \u201d or nazi . he \u201cwas as anti-semitic as you can get , \u201d according to one acquaintance .     propublica contacted orange county prosecutors regarding woodward \u2019 s alleged neo-nazi activities . michelle van der linden , a spokesperson for the district attorney \u2019 s office , said she couldn \u2019 t comment directly on the case , but said the investigation is ongoing , with detectives exploring all possible leads .     woodward told police bernstein had tried to kiss him while they were in the park , according to a sealed affidavit obtained by the orange county register .     woodward \u2019 s defense lawyer , edward munoz , did not immediately respond to a request for comment .     on wednesday , bernstein \u2019 s parents spoke to reporters about the loss of their son , but said they were not interested in talking about any information they had on the investigation of his death . police stood by as mayhem mounted in charlottesville state police and national guardsmen watched passively for hours as self-proclaimed nazis engaged in street battles with counter-protesters . propublica reporter a.c. thompson was on the scene and reports that the authorities turned the streets of the city over to groups of militiamen armed with assault rifles .     the los angeles times quoted his mother , jeanne pepper bernstein , as saying she had worried during her son \u2019 s life that he might be a target \u2014 because he was small , and jewish , and gay .     \u201ci was concerned sending him out into the big world , \u201d she said . \u201cbut at some point you have to let go and they leave the nest and fly . i couldn \u2019 t protect him from everything. \u201d     atomwaffen started in 2015 and is estimated to have about 80 members scattered around the country in small cells ; the former member said the group \u2019 s ranks have grown since the lethal and chaotic \u201cunite the right \u201d rally last summer in charlottesville , virginia .     while many of the new white extremist groups have consciously avoided using nazi imagery , atomwaffen has done the opposite . the name can mean \u201catomic weapons \u201d in german , and the organization embraces third reich iconography , including swastikas , the totenkopf , or death \u2019 s head insignia , and ss lightning bolts . the group frequently produces youtube videos featuring masked atomwaffen members hiking through the backcountry and firing weapons . they \u2019 ve also filmed themselves burning the u.s. constitution and setting fire to the american flag at an atomwaffen \u201cdoomsday hatecamp. \u201d     atomwaffen \u2019 s biggest inspiration seems to be james mason , a long-time fascist who belonged to the american nazi party and later , during the 1970s , joined a more militant offshoot . during the 1980s , mason published a newsletter called siege , in which he eschewed political activism in favor of creating a new fascist regime through murder , small \u201clone wolf \u201d terror attacks , and all-out war against the government . mason also struck up a friendship with the late charles manson , who has become another hero for atomwaffen .     the organization first gained a measure of national attention in may of last year , when 18-year-old devon arthurs , one of atomwaffen \u2019 s founding members , was charged in state court in tampa , florida , with murdering two of his roommates , andrew oneschuk , 18 , and jeremy himmelman , 22. both victims were atomwaffen loyalists .     the murders allegedly occurred after arthurs traded nazism for radical islam . when police took arthurs into custody , according to news accounts based on police reports , he claimed he had shot his former comrades because they had taunted him about his muslim faith and plotted violent attacks to further their fascist agenda . arthurs told investigators he killed onsechuk and himmelman \u201cbecause they want to build a fourth reich. \u201d     while arthurs initially confessed to the killings , he has pleaded not guilty and the case is ongoing . in early january , a judge ordered a psychiatrist to determine whether arthurs is mentally competent to stand trial .     when law enforcement searched the apartment in tampa , florida , where arthurs and the others lived , they found firearms , a framed photograph of oklahoma city bomber timothy mcveigh , rifles , ammunition , and a cooler full of a highly volatile explosive called hmtd . investigators also discovered radioactive material in the home .     the bomb-making material belonged to a fourth roommate , atomwaffen leader brandon russell , a florida national guardsman . arthurs told authorities that russell had been planning to blow up a nuclear power plant near miami . earlier this month russell pleaded guilty in federal district court in tampa to illegal possession of explosives and was sentenced to five years in federal prison .     atomwaffen surfaced again in connection with a double homicide in reston , virginia , in december 2017. a 17-year-old neo-nazi allegedly shot to death his girlfriend \u2019 s parents , buckley kuhn-fricker and scott fricker , who had urged their daughter to break up with him . the accused , who shot himself as well but survived and remains hospitalized , was charged as a juvenile in state court in virginia with two counts of homicide .     the 17-year-old was a big fan of atomwaffen and james mason , according to reporting by the huffington post , which examined his social media trail .     the former atomwaffen member in contact with propublica said that the teen was more than a fan : he was in direct communication with the group .     \u201ctheir rhetoric is some of the most extreme we have seen , \u201d said joanna mendelson , a senior researcher at the anti-defamation league \u2019 s center on extremism . the group , she said , views itself as the radical vanguard of the white supremacist movement , the frontline soldiers of an imminent race war .\n"}, {"url": "file://train/11/1/2", "title": "train/11/1/2", "content": "it \u2019 s fact , not fantasy . in the last four years , at least 13 young men have inflicted tragedies after steeping their psyches in hate forums , websites and across social networking apps .     some have scythed into cultural consciousness . millions know the name dylann storm roof . but many millions more have never heard of neo-nazi hate group atomwaffen division ( awd ) and the iron march forum \u2014 the online race-hate incubator where awd met , recruited and congregated .     nevertheless , that forum and this group exemplify recent trends in the more youthful strains of online extremism and radicalization . many eventual recruits appear to be joining online social networks before becoming members of an established hate group .     and as organized hate groups recruit and centralize in relative obscurity online before ever manifesting \u201cirl \u201d ( \u201cin real life \u201d ) , the void of domestic efforts to counter radicalization grows as fast as young potential recruits move across the web and transition between apps .     in less than a year , awd has proven how young men , some in their teens and early 20s , can steepen the arc of their own radicalization when they gather together . the group has also attracted peers via slick , sophisticated digital propaganda , much of which directed traffic to iron march ( im ) before that forum was taken offline in the fall of 2017.     though it has been in existence since at least october 2015 , awd is only now grabbing headlines , as five murders have been linked to either members , like devon arthurs , 18 ; alleged members , like samuel woodward , 20 ; or individuals , like nicholas giampa , 17 , who associated closely with the group online .     giampa stands accused of executing his girlfriend \u2019 s parents , buckley kuhn-fricker , 43 , and scott fricker , 48. the pair intervened to remove giampa from their daughter \u2019 s life when the depths of his support of violent race-hate became apparent . according to huffington post , his twitter feed shows , \u201ca 17-year-old who \u2019 d drifted beyond the trolling of his teenage peers on the internet far-right and was fully in thrall to the racist , apocalyptic fantasia of white nationalism ... [ who ] tweeted about his hatred of transgender people and his admiration for adolf hitler . he tweeted about using jews as target practice. \u201d     but what nurtured these young men \u2019 s propensity for violence ? in the case of awd , much has been made of the group \u2019 s fetishizing of charles manson and their cherishing of an obscure neo-nazi polemic called siege , a work that stridently promotes terrorism .     behind such references stands james mason , who produced siege as a newsletter from 1980 until the summer of 1986. mason \u2019 s presence in the organized neo-nazi movement in this country stretches back to the mid-1960s , when he was just 14 years old .     for awd members , it \u2019 s not about \u201chelter skelter \u201d or the gory details of the manson family murders alone . it \u2019 s about racial terrorism , the family and its murders \u2013 and their broader cultural impact . here mason serves as a philosophical totem and provides a template for action .     to miss the significance of mason \u2019 s influence in the dark , sensational luster of manson is to lose a vital recognition ; siege and awd are obsessed with a racial revolution , not a cultural one like manson \u2019 s .     awd has only recently begun associating itself so synonymously with mason and siege , and that \u2019 s a dangerous development . mason and his writings preach the praxis of leaderless , cell-structured terrorism and white revolution . furthermore , there is a plethora of terrorists and fringe texts beyond mason \u2019 s that motivate and inspire the group . many of these texts are valued in other sectors of the far-right . importantly , mason \u201cachieved \u201d much within neo-nazism before he was out of his 20s : this is important for young men who , sometimes literally , are gathering around mason and steeping themselves in his revolutionary philosophy and polemics .     they , too , hope to \u201cachieve , \u201d but understanding what that means is equally challenging and vital .     \u201cgtk ! rwn ! \u201d : iron march begins     t he daily stormer \u2019 s creator , andrew anglin , recently claimed that his target demographic includes children as young as 11.     certainly , without the aesthetic , slang and meme-laden milieu of the daily stormer , the im forum would not have developed the way it did . the forum is an extension of , and reaction to , how neo-nazi influencers built a contemporary movement online over the last several years . launched in september 2011 and july 2013 respectively , im and daily stormer did not develop as counterpoints , but as complements to one another .     im \u2019 s slogan , \u201cgas the kikes ! race war now ! 1488 ! boots on the ground ! \u201d was designed to inflame .         the iron march crest .     im became home base for those who were personally invested in neo-nazism , fascism and organized white extremism on a global scale . there , they debated , debased and denigrated , sometimes even each other , and plotted securing a future for whites and their children \u2013 \u2014 violently if necessary . there , the canonical works of global fascism evolved into active discussion threads : \u201cfor my legionaries/ corneliu z. codreanu , \u201d \u201cthe doctrine of fascism/ benito mussolini , \u201d \u201cexcerpts from speeches/ jos\u00e9 antonio primo de rivera. \u201d one early thread was titled , \u201cfascist bookstores , blogs , resources. \u201d     the creator of the thread \u201cwhat is this forum for? , \u201d put forth the following :     this forum exists for discussing human psychology and two specific issues that are very relevant to our political interests :     1. propaganda , manipulation and influence . giving speeches , making allies and turning enemy against enemy . the art of psychological warfare . 2. miscommunication , confirmation bias and other afflictions that stand in the way of progressing our interests and how to overcome them . knowing your enemy in order to destroy him and knowing your ally in order not to offend him because you understand the same word as different things . other topics that still relate to both psychology and politics will also be welcome .     another thread , \u201camerican futurism workshop , \u201d was dedicated to the exploration of how best to inject the tenets of italian futurism \u2014 an important social and artistic movement that helped inspire the rise of fascism in italy \u2014 into contemporary american society . the fact that much of the \u201cfuturism \u201d thread has been reproduced on the siege-culture web site , one of awds new online hubs , evidences how the forum \u2019 s influence endures .     im was the incubator for u.s.-based hate groups like american vanguard , formed in 2015 , which eventually birthed vanguard america in 2017. james fields , before he allegedly killed heather heyer and injured many others , held one of vanguard america \u2019 s shields in charlottesville , virginia .     the united kingdom-based neo-nazi national action ( na ) , whose youth-oriented aspirations and aesthetic helped inspire the founding of other groups internationally , including awd and arguably vanguard america , was also connected to im . in december 2016 , around three years after na \u2019 s formation , it became the first-ever neo-nazi group outlawed as a terrorist organization by the u.k. government . that was five months before the first atomwaffen-linked murders occurred .     beyond anglin and andrew \u201cweev \u201d auernheimer \u2014 the hacker and dedicated neo-nazi involved with daily stormer who encourages the mass-downloading of white supremacy 2.0 into the minds of the young recruits \u2014 there are individuals like \u201ccharles zeiger. \u201d     \u201czeiger \u201d is the alias of a prolific writer at daily stormer and head editor of im \u2019 s webzine , noose , formerly hosted at ropeculture.org . zeiger \u2019 s work was also featured on na \u2019 s wordpress blog .     amongst the aforementioned influencers and dozens of texts presented on im , james mason and his siege found a new , young , niche audience , particularly among awd members and sympathizers .     after languishing in obscurity for decades , mason has been rediscovered .     by the time it was taken offline on september 24 , 2017 , 1,653 unique usernames had been registered on im . the forum \u2019 s legacy demonstrates that for those who have moved on from the forum and are putting boots on the ground , memes are no longer their preferred ammunition \u2014 now , it \u2019 s bullets .     \u201cpowered by hate \u201d : building the siege-pill mill     on may 19 , 2017 , devon arthurs allegedly murdered two other members of atomwaffen division , andrew oneschuk , 18 , and jeremy himmelman , 22 , in the suburban tampa , florida , apartment they shared with the group \u2019 s leader , brandon russell , 21. russell was recently convicted of charges related to explosive materials found on the premises , and arthurs awaits trial .     since russell \u2019 s imprisonment , awd and james mason have become nearly synonymous . the result is an even more terrorist-minded version of the group than what existed under russell , a cadre that fetishizes violence as its core doctrine .     in late june , barely a month after the tampa murders , awd launched a new website and youtube page . in december much of the same content was uploaded to a bitchute account \u2014 a peer-to-peer video service favored by individuals and organizations banned from conventional video hosting services .     under russell , awd had announced itself primarily via fliering and stickering college and university campuses at night , mostly between december 2015 and april 2017.     however , a new phase of awd is now underway . only one fliering incident has occurred since may 19. that \u2019 s when their youtube page shifted away from campus exploits to footage of tactical training with assault rifles and other weapons , urging viewers to step out from behind their computer screens and take action .     on october 24 , 2017 , another new website was registered and hosted via cloudflare : siege-culture ( s-c ) .     with russell in prison , awd \u2019 s most influential member goes by the handle \u201crape \u201d in online forums , and calls himself \u201cvincent snyder on the s-c site , rape publishes under the pen name \u201cvincent snyder. \u201d on its \u201cstaff \u201d page , five of the eight individuals pictured evidence allegiance to , or membership in , awd . snyder \u2019 s photo appears next to mason \u2019 s .     mason \u2019 s influence is evident on that site \u2019 s \u201cworldview \u201d page :     \u201cwhat we are creating here is something that james mason attempted to put into form but because of circumstance it never was implimented [ sic ] until the year of 2017 when atomwaffen division discovered and met james mason . ryan and vincent snyder both agreed to help him publish his works , but through the development of the website we have decided to take the proper course of action with siege . too long has the movement trapped people into a mindset of chasing their own tail . those of you who are in here , perhaps , will create history . that is our intention. \u201d     the page \u2019 s banner features mason and charles manson \u2019 s faces flanking either side of the universal order \u2019 s ( uo ) logo . uo is the terroristic neo-nazi philosophy mason launched in 1982 under the tutelage of manson . as mason describes in siege and elsewhere , the ideas behind the universal order would not have been possible without his years of correspondence with manson , who suggested the uo name and logo .         james mason , seated , with \" vincent snyder . \"     mason \u2019 s association with manson , and his interpretation of manson \u2019 s ideas , developed after mason spent years in the organized neo-nazi movement . during that time , he gravitated toward increasingly radical , terroristic-minded figureheads and efforts .     mason wrote in siege that his correspondence with the imprisoned manson could be construed as cheap , mere shock value . but as the 560-pages of mason \u2019 s text suggest , manson is not the skeleton key for understanding atomwaffen . mason \u2019 s own neo-nazi influences and beliefs in chorus with the universal order philosophy offer a more accurate portrait .     mason began reconfiguring his own sustained belief in the need for neo-nazi terror cells willing to strike at american culture under the control of jewish influences , which he dubs \u201cthe system. \u201d mason had already been moving toward that conclusion on his own for the better part of 15 years .     during that time , mason began networking . as an adolescent he idolized george lincoln rockwell , the leader of the american nazi party ( anp ) , which he first tried to join at just 14. through rockwell , mason also met william pierce \u2014 the eventual founder of the national alliance , author of the turner diaries and this country \u2019 s most influential neo-nazi to date . pierce also helped shepherd young mason into the anp . after rockwell was murdered by a former nazi party member in august 1967 , pierce and mason joined its successor , the national socialist white people \u2019 s party ( nswpp ) . there , mason came into contact with another pierce prot\u00e9g\u00e9 , joseph tommasi .     tommasi was still in his teens when pierce convinced him to pilot a youth effort within the nswpp , one that would flier college campuses , fight with leftists and liberals and mount a foreboding challenge to the radical left on campus . although pierce soon left the nswpp , disgusted by leader matt koehl \u2019 s propensity for costume-oriented activism and pageantry , tommasi and mason stayed on . despite tommasi \u2019 s youth , his profile and influence grew and koehl began to view him as a potential rival for party leadership .     tommasi \u2019 s speeches and writing , ideas about propaganda and desire for street-level confrontation further influenced mason . in siege , he calls tommasi \u2019 s 1974 leaflet , \u201cpolitical terror , \u201d a \u201cwork of the most incredible genius. \u201d     in 1973 , tommasi was ejected from the nswpp . convinced that mass movement-oriented neo-nazism was useless , he founded the national socialist liberation front ( nslf ) in march 1974. the front modeled its name ( taken from the vietnamese liberation front ) , aesthetics , personality and doctrine on radical leftist groups , like the terrorist weather underground .     the nslf sought to announce itself above ground through its actions only , while existing otherwise as an underground , revolutionary terrorist cell , the first of its kind in american neo-nazism . mason eventually followed tommasi out of the nswpp , but tommasi was murdered in august 1975 by an nswpp party member standing guard at its headquarters in el monte , california .     after mason started the siege newsletter in 1980 , he was increasingly adopting manson \u2019 s ideas and perfecting the ideas tommasi first catalyzed . \u201cin the manner prescribed by tommasi , \u201d he writes , \u201c\u2018our most eloquent statements will not be made in courtrooms , but in the streets of jew-capitalist america. \u2019 \u201d he continues elsewhere in the text , underscoring that \u201ctommasi ' s secret was that he essentially stopped talking and started doing . he said that all talk , all discussion , was counter-revolutionary . the situation has been talked to death and still they go on talking ! tommasi also knew the real difference between useless effort and effective action practically applied. \u201d         political propaganda .     after making his first manson-centered propaganda poster while piloting a one-man effort , the national socialist movement , mason decided to reach out to the manson family . he first wrote to family members sandra good and lynette , after learning they were imprisoned in alderson , west virginia . with their endorsement , mason eventually made contact with manson himself . through this correspondence , mason was convinced he had discovered a supreme template for a white supremacist revolution . he described the manson family and their captivating exploits as a model for the white race \u2019 s survival .     by 1982 , mason fully embraces such ideas , introducing the universal order philosophy via the pages of siege .     mason believed the universal order could encourage others to enact a tommasi-esque program of terror with the level of notoriety that the manson family achieved and enjoyed for decades . only through such infamy could neo-nazi terror cells accelerate the collapse of \u201cthe system. \u201d after that , mason and his acolytes could institute a balance and order by instituting a version of national socialism that eschews left/right political binaries . this would solidify the existence of the white race over its enemies .     \u201cwe don \u2019 t want to \u2018hurt \u2019 the system , we want to kill it [ sic ] ! , \u201d he writes .     thus , mason installed manson and the manson family into his canon of idols , alongside rockwell , tommasi and , to a lesser-but-important extent , william pierce . following after those \u201ccrazy men of destiny , \u201d mason regarded manson as \u201cthe more current and up-to-date \u201d version of tommasi \u2019 s terrorist doctrine .     \u201cmanson represents the great divide between those persons who imagine there are still are choices to be made casually on the basis of establishment mores and those who have a profound , individual sense of \u2018no going back. \u2019 i believe it is this - and not the abstract idea of \u2018realism \u2019 - that is the great sustainer and inner-flame of all true revolutionaries. \u201d     like mason \u2019 s other idols , manson represents equal parts philosopher and revolutionary , with an irrepressible desire for violent action .     mason recognized the manson family as a \u201cracial-socialist colony \u201d \u2014 a collective of like-minded individuals from the same race who coalesced for survival within and against a nation riddled with disorder . in manson , mason cultivates a totem for the revolutionary potential of the individual and the collective , where both disappear into one another .     throughout siege , mason is driven by an urgency rooted in one hope \u2014 if only national socialists could come together like the family and captivate the nation through action , which in practice means lone wolf racial terrorism .     this is the danger that atomwaffen division poses , whether members act as individuals or as cells ; forget the shock value of manson . behind mason is an entire canon of terrorist doctrine .     \u201ctimothy mcveigh of oklahoma city fame \u201d : distributing the siege-pill     the siege-culture website presents a future for neo-nazism through the lens of james mason , in the hope that others will see the future the way he does .     as ryan schuster , publisher of siege \u2019 s second edition , writes in his introduction :     siege is to be used as a cookbook and guide . it is sincerely hoped this edition will prevail the vigilant( e ) [ sic ] intelligence to heed a clarion call , wage battles of attrition , and act in a manner commensurate to timothy mcveigh of oklahoma city fame .     with its \u201clibrary \u201d page , s-c extends that guide through a trove of texts on racial terror . many present ludicrous visions of the white race fighting epic battles against immense opposition . texts from v\u00f6lkisch and nazi esotericists , like guido von list and savitri devi , sit alongside the bhagavad gita , valued for its predictions of the kali yuga , or the \u201cage of vice. \u201d     in online neo-nazi circles , satanic texts are providing the most fodder for debate . many are unsure and others angry about what atomwaffen now represents .     two of the three texts in question are the devil \u2019 s notebook by anton lavey , founder of the church of satan , and hostia : secret teachings of the order of nine angles ( o9a ) , a three-volume collection of manuscripts penned by o9a members . they comprise codices of o9a \u2019 s beliefs and practices .     decades ago , the o9a allegedly came under the control of infamous british neo-nazi david myatt , who converted to radical islam , but renounced his conversion eight years later and returned to esoteric spirituality . the group holds an important position in the niche , international nexus of occult , esoteric , and/or satanic neo-nazi groups .     the third book is iron gates , written by a member of the u.s.-based tempel ov blood , a sub-sect of o9a describing itself as \u201ca hybrid between a traditional satanic coven and a ( religious ) militant order. \u201d the novel \u2019 s description on amazon reads as follows :     \u201ciron gates is a sci-fi horror / post-apocalyptic novel , detailing a bleak view of the spiritual horrors of the world-to-come . set seventy years after a worldwide nuclear conflagration , iron gates allows the reader a sight into a nightmarish landscape populated by even more nightmarish characters in a hideous future which leaves little to the imagination . brutal and unsparing , it is not suitable for readers under 18. readers should be advised of extreme graphic content. \u201d         atomwaffen member with iron gates graffiti .     one amazon reviewer writes , \u201cthis is a great book . i ' m glad my good comrade ryan wrote this book . give it a read if you ' re into rape [ sic ] stories and post-apocalyptic child stabing [ sic ] . \u201d     awd \u2019 s turn to the occult and promotion of the hyper-sadistic is disturbing . why would awd push its members toward brutal , dehumanizing violence ?     though many in organized neo-nazism are not convinced their turn toward the occult is sincere , others are reaching for their long knives . some are accused of being \u201cnoctulains , \u201d o9a-devotees who claim to infiltrate fringe political groups , neo-nazis among them , to reorient them toward satanism .     whether awd is morphing or being infiltrated is unclear . awd \u2019 s turn , though , resembles occult neo-nazi groups before them , like the o9a , that meld religious and political extremism \u2014 two powerful conduits for violence . with such a turn , awd is moving beyond the quotient of the culturally forbidden , of fliers broadcasting hate and offensive memes , and down a path toward tragedy .     \u201cthe future awaits \u2026 \u201d : the torch is passed     charles manson holds a certain appeal to those who are attracted to such forbidden ideas . that \u2019 s particularly true for young people who revel in transgressing against society \u2019 s restrictions . it \u2019 s not surprising that atomwaffen division \u2014 under the stewardship of mason \u2014 courts those who embrace cultural taboos beyond neo-nazism to pinpoint new recruits .     in a 1987 videotaped interview with amok press , mason characterized his fascination with \u201cthe forbidden \u201d as crucial to his own recruitment into neo-nazism and acceptance of manson \u2019 s influence :     \u201ci won \u2019 t try to deny , especially in connection with the current manson connection , that there was the element of the forbidden , or the rebellious , involved there , and to me at that time [ during his teen years ] commander rockwell and certainly the image of adolf hitler embodied the furthest extreme of that . and so that just pulled me in like a magnet. \u201d     in siege , mason makes clear his intention to recruit youth , and acknowledges manson \u2019 s magnetic power in such a capacity :     \u201cand youth is the name to be applied to the group of people among whom you will find a majority of those who demand results , not right wing bullshit . manson explains that the older a person becomes , the more frozen they are in the programmed ways the system has inculcated them with . [ .... ] the most adept social and political movers of all times have known that , in order to have a successful movement , you must get ' em [ sic ] while they are young ! [ .... ] it is youth that has the most to lose , that has traditionally been the most idealistic and action-minded . charles manson exerts a fascination over youth today , in the en- tire west , more so by far than anyone else even remotely attuned to what we ' re trying to do. \u201d     he also noted that \u201cyoung , wild , american , anti-establishment \u201d individuals might be more easily attracted to manson than hitler . \u201cmanson scares people , \u201d he writes , \u201cbut he does so in the way they like [ sic ] to be scared . there is no huge , vague , ugly \u2018thing \u2019 attached to manson as there is to hitler. \u201d he writes similarly about tommasi as an emblem , whose revolutionary praxis he describes as \u201cthe very same thing as adolf hitler. \u201d     \u201cin joseph tommasi i see represented a number of things . all of the martyred comrades i can see in tommasi . the young , especially , from the rank-and-file . in him i can still see the hope for the future arising out of the ashes and the dust of the former movement for which he served as a soldier . he represents the clearness of mind and hardness of spirit to not only abandon the past for lost but to attack the present as the only means for achieving a future . and that future is entirely in the hands of those national socialists serious enough to be called revolution. \u201d     awd members are getting siege-pilled through total immersion in mason \u2019 s teleology . now , they are challenging the established far-right and far-left with their eagerness to perpetrate violence .     accused killer nicholas giampa submerged himself in this dark pool . whatever his other troubles , his exposure to awd \u2019 s fetishizing of mass murder and promotion of racial terrorism should provoke grave concern .     since his journey in organized white supremacy began , mason is , perhaps more than ever , seeing his ideas realized \u201cirl. \u201d he has witnessed siege-pilled young men push themselves to action through his designs . this new generation of men might remind mason of his younger self . and they , in turn , are idolizing him , his writings and his actions with uncanny devotion \u2014 just as mason himself idolizes charles manson .         the logo for the universal order philosophy .     late in siege , mason expressed that , perhaps , he could push his philosophy of terroristic neo-nazism no further :     \u201ci have done what i could to inject - subtlely [ sic ] and overtly - as many of manson ' s ideas into movement thought as possible . i have had limited success . but having accomplished this much , i can only hope that the seeds have been planted and the torch passed \u2026 . \u201d     among those who seeded mason \u2019 s extremism , rockwell and tommasi were both killed by fellow white supremacists , years before mason assumed lone control of the siege newsletter . in the years since he ceased its publication and its first book edition was published , both william pierce and charles manson have died .     but mason is alive . and with the inception of siege-culture and his collaboration with the young cell members that comprise atomwaffen division , his hands are on the torch along with theirs .     an ouroboros wreaths the universal order \u2019 s logo ( above ) , which manson helped mason conceive and design . with awd and mason \u2019 s discovery of one another , the snake is no longer eating its tail . its tail and head have virtually disappeared into one another .\n"}], "farshid": [{"url": "file://train/11/0/0", "title": "train/11/0/0", "content": "cornell university libraryarchive-it partner since : mar , 2011organization type : colleges &amp;

late last month , propublica reported that the california man accused of killing a gay and jewish university of pennsylvania student was an avowed neo-nazi and a member of atomwaffen division , one of the country \u2019 s most notorious extremist groups .     the news about the murder suspect , samuel woodward , spread quickly throughout the u.s. , and abroad . woodward was accused of fatally stabbing 19-year-old blaze bernstein and burying his body in an orange county park .     the report , it turns out , was also taken up in the secretive online chats conducted by members of atomwaffen division , a white supremacist group that celebrates both hitler and charles manson .     \u201ci love this , \u201d one member wrote of the killing , according to copies of the online chats obtained by propublica . another called woodward a \u201cone man gay jew wrecking crew. \u201d     more soon joined in .     \u201cwhat i really want to know is who leaked that shit about sam to the media , \u201d a third member wrote .     at least one member wanted to punish the person who had revealed woodward \u2019 s affiliation with atomwaffen .     \u201crats and traitors get the rope first. \u201d     encrypted chat logs obtained by propublica \u2014 some 250,000 messages spanning more than six months \u2014 offer a rare window into atomwaffen division that goes well beyond what has surfaced elsewhere about a group whose members have been implicated in a string of violent crimes . like many white supremacist organizations , atomwaffen division uses discord , an online chat service designed for video gamers , to engage in its confidential online discussions .     in a matter of months , people associated with the group , including woodward , have been charged in five murders ; another group member pleaded guilty to possession of explosives after authorities uncovered a possible plot to blow up a nuclear facility near miami . lucas waldron/propublica     the group \u2019 s propaganda makes clear that atomwaffen \u2014 the word means \u201cnuclear weapons \u201d in german \u2014 embraces third reich ideology and preaches hatred of minorities , gays and jews . atomwaffen produces youtube videos showing members firing weapons and has filmed members burning the u.s. constitution and setting fire to the american flag . but the organization , by and large , cloaks its operations in secrecy and bars members from speaking to the media .     the chat logs and other material obtained by propublica provide unusually extensive information about the group \u2019 s leaders , wider makeup , and potential targets , indicating :     the group may have as many as 20 cells around the country , small groups of indeterminate size in texas , virginia , washington , nevada and elsewhere . members armed with assault rifles and other guns have taken part in weapons training in various locations over the last two years , including last month in the nevada desert near death valley .     members have discussed using explosives to cripple public water systems and destroy parts of the electrical power grid . one member even claimed to have obtained classified maps of the power grid in california . throughout the chats , atomwaffen members laud timothy mcveigh , the former soldier who bombed the alfred p. murrah federal building in oklahoma city in 1995 , killing 168 , including numerous children . charleston church shooter dylann roof and anders breivik , the norwegian extremist who massacred 77 people , also come in for praise .     woodward posted several messages in the days after bernstein \u2019 s murder , but before he was arrested and charged . in one thread , he told his fellow atomwaffen members that he was thinking about the \u201cpassing of life \u201d and was \u201ctruly grateful for our time together. \u201d an atomwaffen propaganda flier     woodward , 20 , has pleaded not guilty in the bernstein case . prosecutors have said they are exploring whether the murder constituted a hate crime and detectives are now investigating what role , if any , atomwaffen might have played in the homicide . woodward and bernstein had known each other in high school in california , and appear to have reconnected somehow shortly before the killing .     law enforcement , both federal and state , have said little about what they make of atomwaffen . but organizations dedicated to tracking and studying hate groups have been calling attention to what they regard as the group \u2019 s considerable threat .     \u201cwe haven \u2019 t seen anything like atomwaffen in quite a while , \u201d said keegan hankes , a researcher who tracks the group for the southern poverty law center . \u201cthey should be taken seriously because they \u2019 re so extreme. \u201d     jeffrey kaplan , a historian , has studied racial extremists for decades and edited the encyclopedia of white power . in an interview , he suggested that atomwaffen is dangerous , but that talk in their propaganda and private conversations of aims such as toppling the u.s. government amounted to what he called a kind of \u201cmagical thinking. \u201d kaplan said such groups often contain a handful of diehards who are willing to commit crimes and many more wannabes who are unwilling to do much more than read fascist literature .     \u201cit \u2019 s very hard to go from talking about violence to looking a guy in the eyes and killing him , \u201d said kaplan , a professor of national security studies at king fahd defense college in saudi arabia .     where we \u2019 ve identified atomwaffen division members through interviews and internal records , propublica was able to identify atomwaffen members in at least 23 states . lucas waldron and rob weychert/propublica     \u201cpolitics are useless . revolution is necessary. \u201d     propublica has identified five key atomwaffen members through information provided by law enforcement investigators , internal atomwaffen records , outside experts and a former group member .     those records and interviews make clear that john cameron denton is the leader of atomwaffen . denton , 24 , grew up in montgomery , texas , a small town about 30 miles north of houston . public records show denton currently lives in the nearby town of conroe , a few miles to the south of montgomery .     propublica has obtained several photos of denton . in one , denton , who is short and wiry , has a bulky combat shotgun slung over his shoulder . he seems to favor camouflage pants and black t-shirts emblazoned with the logos of national socialist black metal bands , a fringe subgenre of heavy metal music that mixes satanic and nazi themes .     \u201cpolitics are useless . revolution is necessary , \u201d denton said in a chat post expressing the atomwaffen worldview .     records and interviews show denton goes by the name rape in the online conversations , and he appears to be involved in nearly every aspect of the organization . he shapes atomwaffen \u2019 s ideology , chooses designs for its distinctive black-and-white posters and online propaganda , and selects the books that new recruits must study as part of their initiation , said a former atomwaffen member interviewed by propublica . denton \u2019 s younger brother , grayson patrick denton , 19 , is also a member , according to the chat logs and interviews ; within the group , he goes by leon , an homage to a belgian fascist who fought with the ss . john cameron denton alias : rape john cameron denton is the leader of atomwaffen division . the 24-year-old grew up in montgomery , texas , and lives outside houston .     the leader \u2019 s identity was first revealed last month in a report by the anti-defamation league . afterward , denton was seething . \u201cthey think they can stop rape ! ? they think they can stop me ! ? ! , \u201d denton wrote in one chat message .     neither denton brother responded to messages seeking comment .     just how many people belong to atomwaffen is unknown . the ex-member told propublica that the group has enlisted about 80 members across the country , many of whom joined after the deadly events in charlottesville last summer .     an internal atomwaffen document obtained by propublica shows members scattered across 23 states and canada . the group \u2019 s largest chapters are based in virginia , texas and washington , according to a message posted in the chats by an atomwaffen recruiter last summer .     \u201ceach chapter operates independently , \u201d wrote the recruiter . \u201cwe want men who are willing to be the boots on the ground . joining us means serious dedication not only to the atomwaffen division and its members , but to the goal of total aryan victory. \u201d     a review of the chat logs shows messages posted by people using more than 100 different user names . access to the discussions is tightly controlled , and it is unclear if some members post under multiple usernames .     denton has helped build the organization around the ideas expressed in an obscure , hyper-violent book : \u201csiege. \u201d the 563-page book collects and organizes the monthly newsletters produced during the 1980s by an old-line neo-nazi activist named james mason . it is required reading for all atomwaffen members and serves as the backbone for the organization \u2019 s ideology , worldview and training program .     when mason began publishing his newsletter in 1980 , he was bitter and deeply dismayed . he had devoted his life to the fascist cause , joining the american nazi party in the mid-1960s , at the age of 14. but the movement had completely failed .     for mason , the way forward was obvious : he no longer wanted to convince the masses of the rightness of nazism . they would never get it . now was the time for true believers to go underground and launch a clandestine guerrilla war aimed at bringing down \u201cthe system. \u201d     \u201csiege \u201d is essentially a long string of essays celebrating murder and chaos in the name of white supremacy . in mason \u2019 s view , dan white , the local politician who assassinated san francisco mayor george moscone and gay civil rights leader harvey milk , was a hero .     mason proposed the creation of a white liberation front composed of small armed squads that would \u201chide in wilderness areas , \u201d moving frequently from location to location while striking out in a string of \u201chit-and-run engagements. \u201d mason based this proposed organization on the short-lived national socialist liberation front , a small splinter group of the american nazi party that formed in 1969 and espoused the strategic use of political terrorism . grayson patrick denton aliases : nazgul , leon grayson patrick denton is the 19-year-old brother of atomwaffen leader john cameron denton . he is a member of the texas cell .     the chat logs show that denton and other atomwaffen figures are in contact with mason , who is 65 and is said to be living in denver , colorado ; in one online conversation , samuel woodward wrote about meeting with mason face to face along with other atomwaffen members . in chats , members frequently post pictures of mason and revere him as a brilliant , under-appreciated thinker .     propublica was unable to contact mason .     jeffrey kaplan , the academic at king fahd defense college in riyadh , interviewed mason in the 1990s and spoke to propublica about mason \u2019 s outlook and the groups he inspires , such as atomwaffen .     he describes mason as \u201ca true believer. \u201d     \u201cnow he \u2019 s got a following , which he didn \u2019 t have for the last 30 years , \u201d kaplan said . \u201che \u2019 s got some kids who \u2019 ve rediscovered him . he must be in heaven. \u201d     as kaplan sees it , groups such as atomwaffen \u2014 would-be nazi guerrillas devoted to white revolution in the u.s. \u2014 are \u201cakin to cults , \u201d and are propelled by a quasi-religious faith that they will ultimately prevail . he continued , \u201cwhat else would sustain you when everyone hates you ? \u201d     john cameron denton , based on interviews and the material obtained by propublica , comes across as something of a cult leader . lately he has been pushing for atomwaffen members to pool money and purchase land in rural areas so they can \u201cget the fuck off the grid , \u201d and begin implementing their revolutionary agenda . the former member said denton envisions using this network of atomwaffen compounds to launch attacks against targets in the u.s.     the leader is already girding for a confrontation with law enforcement . \u201ci do expect that one day i ' ll get raided , \u201d wrote denton in one chat message . \u201ci ' m not gonna have a shoot out or anything stupid like that , but i just dont rule out possibilities because i know the govt doesnt play by the rules . \"     \u201cyou would want to target things like substations , water filtration plants , etc. \u201d     late last month , atomwaffen held a three-day training session \u2014 or \u201chate camp \u201d in the group \u2019 s parlance \u2014 deep in the nevada desert . the event was organized by an atomwaffen leader , michael lloyd hubsky , who calls himself komissar , according to the chat logs . michael lloyd hubsky alias : komissar hubsky , 29 , lives in las vegas and leads atomwaffen \u2019 s nevada cell . in online chats he discussed blowing up the u.s. power grid and natural gas lines .     a 29-year-old resident of las vegas , hubsky holds both a concealed weapons permit and a security guard license , and is a big fan of high-powered military-style firearms . in one post he discussed a favorite weapon : a czech-made rifle called a cz scorpion that , hubsky said , he \u2019 d converted to fully automatic and equipped with a flash suppressor .     in another message , hubsky wrote that he was planning on getting an \u201cffl \u201d \u2014 federal firearms license \u2014 so he could \u201cmanufacture \u201d guns .     \u201ci can literally become our armory in the event we need it , \u201d hubsky bragged .     the former member said atomwaffen has a rule : don \u2019 t talk about the group \u2019 s terrorist ambitions in online chats or on social media . those sorts of conversations are only supposed to happen in person . but hubsky , at times , has been less than discreet outside the group \u2019 s confidential chats .     \u201cso in any war , you need to cut off your enemy \u2019 s ability to shoot , move and communicate , \u201d hubsky wrote in a september 2017 message posted in a discussion on white nationalism that occurred in a non-atomwaffen chat room . \u201cyou would want to target things like : substations , water filtration plants , etc. \u201d propublica has obtained hubsky \u2019 s statements from that online conversation .     hubsky wrote that he had \u201ca map of the us power grid. \u201d     \u201cwest-coast only , \u201d he added in the message . \u201cclassified map . had someone with special permissions get it. \u201d john cameron denton , left , in an undated photograph with other white supremacists     hubsky also discussed blowing up natural gas lines .     \u201cyou put a home-made thermite grenade on those , \u201d he wrote . while other types of infrastructure \u2014 like water lines \u2013 figured in hubsky \u2019 s discussions , hitting the power grid was , in his view , the most devastating and effective attack possible . destroying electricity infrastructure , hubsky wrote , \u201cwould by default take out the internet because it relies on power to operate. \u201d     in a telephone conversation and subsequent series of text messages with propublica , hubsky at first denied being a member of atomwaffen . but he later offered to discuss the group at length if his name was not made public , an arrangement propublica declined . hubsky acknowledged that he owns a cz scorpion assault rifle \u2014 even sharing a picture of the weapon \u2014 but said it was not fully automatic . he concluded the exchange by saying he had retained a lawyer .     hubsky \u2019 s organization of the three-day hate camp in nevada began with a proposal to the group late last year . he offered to arrange it so the group could hone its combat skills . there would be shooting and hand-to-hand sparring at a secret location on the edge of death valley .     atomwaffen had already held a hate camp in the shawnee national forest in southern illinois during the fall of 2017. at least 10 members from different states attended , with some driving in from as far away as texas , kansas , oklahoma and new jersey . in the pacific northwest , cell members had converged on an abandoned cement factory , known as \u201cdevil ' s tower \u201d near the small town of concrete , washington , where they had screamed \u201cgas the kikes , race war now ! \u201d while firing off round after round from any array of weapons , including an ar-15 assault rifle with a high capacity drum magazine .     the training sessions were documented in atomwaffen propaganda videos . kaleb j. cole alias : khimaere atomwaffen \u2019 s washington chapter leader is kaleb j. cole . cole , who owns an ak-47 assault rifle with a large-capacity magazine , helped organize arms training sessions in washington and nevada . he also works on the group \u2019 s visual propaganda .     members had also organized smaller training sessions , such as the one last year in texas that had drawn blaze bernstein \u2019 s alleged murderer , samuel woodward . the texas training attended by woodward took place in the countryside outside san antonio and involved 10 members of the texas cell who took part in firearms , survival and weapons instruction .     hubsky scheduled his training camp during the last weekend in january . atomwaffen \u2019 s washington chapter leader kaleb j. cole , who uses the alias khimaere , agreed to help organize the desert training session in nevada , which the group started calling the death valley hate camp .     \u201cbring your uniform , rifle/sidearm , and whatever camping gear you need , \u201d he wrote . cole , who is 22 and lives close to the canadian border in the town of blaine , is a national socialist black metal enthusiast who holds a concealed firearms permit and owns an ak-47 . in 2015 , while cole was living in bellingham , police responded to a report that he had \u201cnazi memorabilia \u201d in his residence , according to lt. danette beckley of the bellingham police department ; he was also reported to police in the island town of anacortes for allegedly harassing a jewish grocery store owner by a waving a nazi flag in front of the business , according to two law enforcement sources .     the former atomwaffen member told propublica that cole wields a significant degree of influence over the organization \u2019 s propaganda , recruitment and organization . propublica could not reach cole for comment .     when the group got out to the desert , hubsky made sure they shot photos and videos to be used in atomwaffen recruiting clips . in one picture obtained by propublica , an atomwaffen member is standing at the base of a sand dune showing off a military-grade weapon \u2014 an mcx virtus rifle made by sig sauer \u2014 while holding a flag bearing the atomwaffen insignia , a black shield bearing the symbol for radioactivity . another member , clutching an assault rifle , is also in the photo .     hubsky returned from death valley enthused and eager to do more training . he uploaded a memo to the atomwaffen chat . members would now be required to join front sight , a \u201cprivate combat training facility \u201d outside of las vegas in the small desert town of pahrump . front sight , the memo said , could provide classes in \u201cuzi and full auto m16 combat , as well as knife fighting , hand to hand combat , \u201d and instruction in climbing and rappelling .     \u201ci don ' t know anything about this group , \u201d bill cookston , front sight \u2019 s director of operations , said this week . \u201cif anyone were to be doing something against the law or in a radical manner , we would look into that. \u201d     shortly afterward , michael meacher , front sight \u2019 s ceo , said the training center had sent hubsky a letter refunding his membership fees and informing the las vegas resident that he was banned from the facility for life .     \u201cnot that the faggot kike didn \u2019 t deserve to die. \u201d     before samuel woodward was jailed on charges of murdering blaze bernstein , he frequently participated in the atomwaffen chats . first he used the handle saboteur . later he posted under the name arn .     often , woodward sounded like a typical 20-year-old . he enthused about video games ( bioshock , skyrim ) and tv shows ( he liked the early seasons of \u201ctrailer park boys , \u201d a canadian comedy series ) . he complained about not having a girlfriend . read more about woodward california murder suspect said to have trained with extremist hate group the 20-year-old man charged in orange county with killing a gay jewish college student earlier this month is said to have belonged to atomwaffen division , a neo-nazi group .     but woodward also railed at \u201cmongrels and jews \u201d and gays .     he praised mein kampf and seemed to regard \u201csiege \u201d as something akin to divine revelation ; from his perspective , violence and society-shaking mayhem were the only options for a true nazi .     that orientation attracted him to outlaw groups like the national socialist underground , a german organization that carried out a massive terror spree between 2001 and 2011 , robbing 14 banks , planting bombs and murdering 10 people , most of them immigrants . \u201cthe nsu was pretty cool , \u201d woodward wrote .     in one conversation , woodward discussed the bosnian civil war of the 1990s , during which serbian soldiers and paramilitary fighters raped thousands of bosnian muslim women as part of an infamous campaign of ethnic cleansing . \u201cthe only acceptable case of miscegenation is what the serbs did to captured bosniak women , \u201d he wrote in november 2017.     woodward liked the idea of using rape to terrorize women of color , whom he saw as his foes . \u201cforce them to carry around the spawn of their master and enemy , \u201d he wrote .     propublica sought comment on the chats from woodward \u2019 s lawyer , edward munoz , but did not get a response .     on jan. 26 , propublica published a story revealing woodward \u2019 s belief in nazism and exposing his involvement with atomwaffen .     while the article attracted the attention of atomwaffen members , who promptly posted it to their online chats , no one in the group expressed any sympathy for bernstein , the young man woodward allegedly murdered . they made jokes about his slaying and used slurs to describe him . if there was worry , it was about woodward possibly having to do time behind bars for the murder .     \u201csam did something stupid , \u201d wrote one member . \u201cnot that the faggot kike didn \u2019 t deserve to die . just simply not worth a life in prison for. \u201d     sean michael fernandez , an atomwaffen leader in texas , even saw an upside for the group . fernandez , who used the alias wehrwolf , believed that atomwaffen actually stood to benefit from the increased notoriety stemming from woodward \u2019 s affiliation with the neo-nazi group and the bernstein murder .     \u201cwe \u2019 re only going to inspire more \u2018copycat crimes \u2019 in the name of awd . all we have to do is spread our image and our propaganda , \u201d fernandez wrote on jan. 30. sean michael fernandez alias : wehrwolf sean michael fernandez is a leader of the texas cell .     he continued : \u201cthe growing fear is what we set out to do and it \u2019 s working exactly how i wanted it to since we took over \u2018leadership. \u2019 i couldn ' t have planned this better , seriously. \u201d     for his part , denton , the national atomwaffen leader , felt betrayed . propublica had interviewed a former member for the story ; still , denton believed that someone currently within the ranks was sharing information with the media . \u201clooks like awd needs another purging , \u201d he wrote .     members began speculating about who was talking to outsiders . was it a current member ? was it someone they \u2019 d kicked out recently ?     members also directed their rage toward the media . as they saw it , woodward was the one being victimized . now that his involvement with atomwaffen had spilled out into the public sphere , orange county prosecutors might hit him with hate crimes charges \u2014 charges that could potentially add years to a prison sentence .     \u201cwe really owe those jews at propublica , \u201d wrote one member .     woodward posted many hundreds of messages to the atomwaffen chats . but on jan. 5 , he typed out a few lines that are quite distinct from all the rest . in them , the raging young man suddenly became highly sentimental . two days earlier , according to prosecutors , he had buried bernstein \u2019 s lifeless body in a park in lake forest , california .     now woodward explained that he was reflecting on mortality .     \u201chey everyone , \u201d he wrote . \u201ci just wanted to let you all know i love you so much. \u201d\n"}]},
