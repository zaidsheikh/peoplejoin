female no . 2 official at the cia .     on wednesday , barack obama nominated avril danica haines to be the deputy director of the cia , replacing michael morell , who twice served as acting director of the agency but took much of the blame for editing the highly controversial talking points around the 2012 attack on the consulate in benghazi . as a lawyer in the white house counsel \u2019 s office , haines oversaw the approval process for the cia ' s covert actions , acting as a vital link between the cia and the president .     but 20 years ago , haines opened and co-owned adrian \u2019

featured regular \u201cerotica nights. \u201d including dinner and a series of readings by guests of published work or their own prose , according to a 1995 report in the baltimore sun ; couples could attend for $ 30 , while singles paid $ 17 .     \" erotica has become more prevalent because people are trying to have sex without having sex . others are trying to find new fantasies to make their monogamous relationships more satisfying , \u201d haines , then in her 20s , told the sun . \u201cwhat the erotic offers is spontaneity , twists and turns . and it affects everyone . \" ( she also told baltimore sun reporter mary corey that friends heckled \u201cyou just want a mass orgy in your bookstore , while she and her co-owner were initially worried only \" dirty old men \" would show up. )     the event corey attended at the bookstore featured a room lit with red candles where guests held chicken tostadas , waiting to eat as haines read aloud the opening pages of the claiming of sleeping beauty , by anne rice writing under the pseudonym a.n . roquelaire , which features passages such as :     \u201che mounted her , parting her legs , giving the white inner flesh of her thighs a soft deep pinch , and , clasping her right breast in his hand , he thrust his sex into her .     he was holding her up as he did this , to gather her mouth to him , and as he broke through her innocence , he opened her mouth with his tongue and pinched her breast sharply. \u201d     but her bookstore was hardly defined by erotica ( which was shelved between self-help and parenting ) , stocking titles from a variety of smaller publishing houses and local authors , and offering a caf\u00e9 . haines was also well respected in the close-knit waterfront neighborhood of fells point , according to former neighbors .     one of them , long-time neighborhood fixture steve bunker , who has since retired to maine , raved about haines to the daily beast , saying \u201cshe \u2019 s brilliant , has a genius iq , is easy to work with , and reliable. \u201d he recalled going to new year \u2019 s eve parties with her at the $ 22 million dollar townhouses then owned by her father , dr. thomas haines , a liberal activist and noted chemist , on the upper west side of new york .     another property owner in the neighborhood , howard barstop , raved about haines \u2019 work ethic ,

, vilnius , lithuania , was known as the jerusalem of lithuania \u2014 a bustling town home to more than 100,000 jews at its peak . but then it all vanished .     in three years during the holocaust , 95 % of lithuanian jews were killed . but hidden within this tragedy is a story of hope and courage that archeologists are just now bringing to light .     jews from the vilnius ghetto were executed in a pit in the ponary woods between 1941 , when this photo was taken , and 1944.     on june 8 , a team led by richard freund , a judaic studies professor at the university of hartford , and jon seligman , an archaeologist with the israel antiquities authority , discovered the existence of an escape tunnel at ponar , just outside of vilnius . the tunnel had been rumored in oral histories kept alive by escapees , their descendants , and other lithuanian jews from that era , including freund \u2019 s great-grandfather , who came from vilnius .     on the last night of passover , april 14 , 1944 , 80 jews began their escape from the pit where they were being held prisoner through a 100-foot tunnel that had been painstakingly dug by hand .     the pit where the tunnel began .     digging in the dark of night , chained to one another , the prisoners had secretly scratched at the earth for three months before their daring escape . of the 80 prisoners who attempted the getaway , only 11 survived . but they told their stories , and the tunnel gained legendary status among the people of vilnius .     for decades , the exact location of the tunnel remained a mystery , and archaeologists couldn \u2019 t dig at the site for risk of disturbing more than the 100,000 remains buried at ponar .     however , advances in archeological technology allowed freund and his team to study the site using noninvasive techniques , including ground penetrating radar ( gpr ) and electrical resistivity tomography ( ert ) . upon turning on their equipment , they discovered the escape tunnel almost immediately .     richard freund studies the ert data that first revealed evidence of the tunnel .     \u201cwhen they ran the first test over the area leading outside of the pit where [ the prisoners ] started from , they immediately saw it on the imaging. \u201d freund said . \u201cthere was nothing but sand , and the tunnel lit up . that was a moment. \u201d     gpr works similar to traditional radar , but instead of sending radio waves through the air , it broadcasts them into the ground . the resulting charts illustrate what lies below without disturbing the site , and archaeologists can see the results immediately , said dean goodman , a geophysicist at gpr-slice software , a company that specializes in gpr software . \u201cwe \u2019 re able to collect a lot of data really quickly and almost see the results real time . as you \u2019 re collecting the antenna over ground , you actually get a 2d profile of the swath of ground you \u2019 re going over. \u201d     the other technique , ert , is usually used by geologists working in the oil and gas industry , not archaeologists . ert works by sending a current into the ground and measuring the electrical resistance of the various substrates , producing a map of what lies below .     richard freund and his collaborators discuss which area of the site to study next .     gpr and ert enable archaeologists to peer into sites that were previously off limits because they couldn \u2019 t be disturbed .     \u201call these technologies allow people to gain information about an era \u2014 the holocaust era \u2014 without having to desecrate a burial site , \u201d freund said .     freund is working with the vilna gaon jewish state museum and the tolerance center of lithuania to create an exhibit so that visitors from around the world can hear the story of the courageous jews that dug their way out of the death pits .     freund said it will be a refreshingly different piece of holocaust history \u2014 \u201ca story about life instead of death. \u201d     \u201cholocaust escape tunnel \u201d will air april 19 , 2017 on pbs .     find out more about this breathtaking find .\n"}], "hannah": [{"url":

   the talking points were used by rice on sunday talk shows to describe the benghazi attack as growing out of a spontaneous demonstration sparked by a movie trailer that muslims found offensive to their religion . republicans have conducted multiple hearings on the administration \u2019 s response .     when the obama administration released almost 100 pages of e-mails about the origins of the talking points last month , administration officials said that they showed that it was morell , a career cia employee , who made the final edits to the document .     that chain of authorship allowed the obama administration to preserve its argument that the white house made only minor edits to a document that originated in the intelligence community .     final draft     references to al-qaeda
