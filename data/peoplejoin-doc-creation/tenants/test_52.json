( mark wilson/getty images )     both trump and clinton relied on their personal attorneys to review their private emails and determine which messages should be retained as government records .     clinton originally said none of the messages she sent or received were \u201cmarked classified. \u201d the fbi later determined that 110 emails contained classified information at the time they were sent or received .

[ ivanka trump shuts down her namesake clothing brand ]     in late february 2017 , she used her personal email to contact small business administration chief linda mcmahon and propose they meet to explore \u201copportunities to collaborate. \u201d the following month , she emailed education secretary betsy devos , suggesting that their staffers meet to discuss ways to collaborate on \u201clocational/workforce development and k-12 stem education. \u201d     while her messages were largely about government work , trump was not then subject to white house records rules .     when she joined the white house on march 30 , trump pledged to comply \u201cwith all ethics rules , \u201d responding to complaints that her voluntary role gave her all of the access and perks of the white house \u2014 but none of the legal responsibilities or constraints .     \u201cthroughout this process i have been working closely and in good faith with the white house counsel and my personal counsel to address the unprecedented nature of my role , \u201d she said in a statement at the time .     but trump continued to occasionally use her personal email in her official capacity , according to people familiar with the review .     her husband \u2019 s use of personal email for government work drew intense scrutiny when it was first reported by politico last fall . the revelation prompted demands from congressional investigators that kushner preserve his records , which his attorney said he had . at the time , administration officials acknowledged to news organizations , including the new york times and politico , that ivanka trump had occasionally used a private account when she joined the white house .     [ kushner used private email account for some white house business ]     but trump had used her personal email for official business far more frequently than known , according to people familiar with the administration \u2019 s review \u2014 a fact that remained a closely held secret inside the white house .     \u201cshe was the worst offender in the white house , \u201d said a former senior u.s. government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal dynamics .     after discovering the extent of her email use in september 2017 , white house lawyers relied on lowell , ivanka trump \u2019 s attorney , to help review her personal emails to determine which were personal and which were official business , according to the people .     the white house counsel \u2019 s office did not have access to her personal account and could not review it without invading her privacy and possibly violating privileged communications with her attorneys , people familiar with the review said .     after his review , lowell forwarded emails that he had determined were related to official business to ivanka trump \u2019 s government account , a move he viewed as rectifying any violations of the records law , they said .     lowell \u2019 s review found fewer than 1,000 personal emails in which trump shared her official schedule and travel plans with herself and her personal assistants , according to two people familiar with the review .     separately , there were fewer than 100 emails in which trump used her personal account to discuss official business with other administration officials .     the scope of her personal email use had not emerged in response to american oversight \u2019 s records request , which sought trump \u2019 s correspondence with cabinet agencies in early 2017. most internal white house communications are not subject to the freedom of information act .     \u201ci \u2019 m disappointed \u2014 although not entirely surprised \u2014 that this administration disregarded clear laws that they more than anyone should have been aware of , \u201d evers said .     in many cases , government officials contacted ivanka trump first at her personal email address . that was the case with a note she received in april 2017 from treasury department official dan kowalski , who was seeking to set up a meeting between the president and the secretary general of the organization for economic cooperation and development , an international economic group of which the united states is a member .     \u201ci apologize for reaching out to you

that the world economic recovery remains \" fragile \" and urged continued spending to support growth , an expansionist call at the end of a summit marked by an agreement among developed nations to halve their annual deficits within three years .     the president ' s remarks tempered the group of 20 ' s headline achievement at the summit , a deficit-reduction target that had been pushed by canadian prime minister stephen harper , the host of the meeting and a fiscal conservative . although there is broad agreement that government debt in the developed world needs to be reduced , there is concern that cutting too fast and too deeply will slow growth and possibly spark a new recession .     in a news conference at the meeting ' s conclusion , obama said that the world ' s largest economic powers had agreed on the need for \" continued growth in the short term and fiscal sustainability in the medium term . \"     \" a number of our european partners are making difficult decisions , \" obama said . \" but we must recognize that our fiscal health tomorrow will rest in no small measure on our ability to create jobs and growth today . \"     the group ' s closing statement included the specific deficit-reduction target , but it was couched in caveats -- that deficit reduction needed to be \" calibrated \" to avoid harming growth , paced differently in each country and paired with other reforms to strengthen the economy .     obama and european leaders , in particular , came to the meeting with sharply different views of the strength of the global economic recovery , with the u.s. president more pessimistic . the declaration , in the works for weeks , gave each side what it wanted , although the specific deadlines went further than the obama administration had preferred before the meeting .     the administration accepted the deadlines in order to avoid standing against harper and such important economic powers as germany . in his closing remarks , obama stressed that \" every country will chart its own unique course , but make no mistake -- we ' re moving in the same direction . \"     the international monetary fund ' s managing director , dominique strauss-kahn , called the deficit target an \" oversimplification \" of the problem ; he said it was more important for individual countries to craft the right economic policies to sustain growth , not blindly cut for the sake of meeting a goal .     along with pledging to cut their annual budget deficits by 2013 , the developed countries committed to stabilizing their overall debt by 2016. obama recently set similar goals for the united states .     despite the seeming division between the united states ' deficit-reduction target and the slower approach favored by canada and germany , obama said there was \" violent agreement \" within the group about the need to find proper balance -- with some highly indebted countries such as greece needing to cut immediately and others supporting the recovery with higher spending .     overall , the group ' s final statement reflects its consensus theory for how the world economy needs to change , with the heavily indebted western nations steadily taming government deficits , and surplus-rich nations \" rebalancing \" to boost local spending and demand .     strong emerging markets such as china , the document said , need to guard against a slowdown by encouraging their governments and people to spend more , investing more on infrastructure , establishing better social safety nets to give families more income , and allowing exchange rates to fluctuate more freely -- a quiet reference to china ' s managed currency policies . china is a member of the g-20 .     \" advanced surplus \" countries -- developed nations that run large trade surpluses -- committed to try to narrow the gap between imports and exports , a particular concern in europe , where germany ' s powerful export-led economy is blamed by some for economic weakness in greece and elsewhere .     but the g-20 delegations also left toronto with much of the heavy lifting on new global financial rules still ahead of them .     discussion of a global bank tax -- once considered a major issue for the group -- ended with a commitment that the financial sector would make a \" fair \" contribution to the cost of resolving financial crises , but leaving it to each nation to decide how and when the contribution would be collected .     the group also committed to requiring banks worldwide to hold a \" significantly higher \" amount of capital to buffer them against financial shock . but acknowledging the difficulty that will pose to some institutions , the group ' s statement opened the door for a transition period to give weaker companies time to raise the funds .     the g-20 hopes by the end of this year to have new capital rules for banks in place , and leaders consider the issue a core element of global financial reform . but an early test of proposed bank capital rules found that they risked undermining economic growth . even banks in relatively healthy systems , such as canada , would have been in a bind and forced to raise substantial new funds , according to bankers and officials familiar with the matter .     \" we have the confluence of two forces . one is about making sure there are no more crises , but we have to make sure we don ' t destroy our domestic banking systems , \" said hyun song shin , senior economic adviser to the south korean government . \" what you don ' t want to do is strangle bank lending . \"\n"}], "hannah": [{"url": "file://test/52/2/1", "title": "test/52/2/1", "content": "president trump \u2019 s former personal attorney michael cohen pleaded

"test/52/0/1", "content": "toronto \u2014 leaders of the world \u2019 s biggest economies agreed sunday on a timetable for cutting deficits and halting the growth of their debt , but also acknowledged the need to move carefully so that reductions in spending did not set back the fragile global recovery .     the action at the group of 20 summit meeting here signaled the determination of many of the wealthiest countries , after enacting spending programs to counter the worldwide financial crisis , to now emphasize debt reduction . and it underscored the conviction of european nations in particular that deficits represented the biggest threat to their economic stability .     president obama and treasury secretary timothy f. geithner had consistently advocated a measured approach to debt reduction that would not stymie growth and lead to a double-dip recession .     the united states , however , joined other countries at the summit meeting , which was met by protests and several hundred arrests , by endorsing a goal of cutting government deficits in half by 2013 and stabilizing the ratio of public debt to gross domestic product by 2016. canada \u2019 s prime minister , stephen harper , had proposed the targets , backed by germany and britain .     to assuage objections from the united states , japan , india and some other countries , the timetable was couched as an expectation , rather than a firm deadline . the g-20 joint statement explicitly stated that japan , which is heavily dependent on domestic borrowing , was not expected to meet the targets .     the divisions were in contrast to the unity that characterized the previous three g-20 leaders \u2019 summits , when the urgency of a potential global collapse produced solidarity and a unified economic approach . although mr. obama insisted emphatically that there was \u201cviolent agreement \u201d on the need to reduce debt over time , the final communiqu\u00e9 included a delicately worded call for deficit reduction \u201ctailored to national circumstances. \u201d in essence , the leaders were blessing their decision to go their own ways .     the joint statement acknowledged both sides of the debate . \u201cthere is a risk that synchronized fiscal adjustment across several major economies could adversely impact the recovery , \u201d the statement said . \u201cthere is also a risk that the failure to implement consolidation where necessary would undermine confidence and hamper growth. \u201d     in a news conference at the conclusion of the summit meeting , mr. obama referred only indirectly to the disagreement with europe , saying , \u201cwe must recognize that our fiscal health tomorrow will rest in no small measure on our ability to create jobs today. \u201d     his concern about stimulus was echoed by some economists who viewed the pledge on deficits as imperiling the prospects for growth .     \u201cchina \u2019 s growth , specifically , is not seen as sustainable at current rates , \u201d ronald a. kurtz , professor of global economics and management at the massachusetts institute of technology , said in an e-mail message . \u201cthe g-20 declaration therefore amounts to saying \u2018assume a miracle \u2019 for global growth. \u201d he said europe \u2019 s fiscal austerity plans would also slow growth .     but dominique strauss-kahn , head of the international monetary fund , said he thought the risks of a new downturn were minimal .     \u201cwe don \u2019 t forecast any double dip , \u201d he said . \u201cdouble dip was not discussed at the meeting. \u201d     it is the first time the g-20 has set dates for deficit reduction , but the timetable , which is not binding , will probably not require new policy actions . most of the governments , including the united states , have already put forward budget proposals in line with the targets .     the leaders also discussed banking regulations , but could not agree on a proposal for a global bank tax , supported by the united states , britain and the european union , but opposed by canada and australia .     and while the g-20 reaffirmed a deadline \u2014 their next meeting , in november in seoul , south korea \u2014 for agreeing on new capital standards for banks , they signaled that several countries might not implement the standards by 2012 , as initially planned .     \u201cwhile the illusion of progress is good , i don \u2019 t see real action to alter the imbalances that brought us to this crisis , \u201d said raghuram g. rajan , a former chief economist at the international monetary fund who is now a professor in the booth school of business at the university of chicago .     the united states , he said , continues to run large trade deficits financed by germany , china and japan . \u201cthe u.s. has been the world \u2019 s consumer of first resort , \u201d he added , \u201cand because it has been unable to persuade other countries to spend more or to reform quickly , it is likely to take up that position once again. \u201d     though mr. obama did not prevail in his emphasis on stimulus , he did arrive in canada with three victories under his belt .     european leaders had agreed to conduct stress tests on their big banks , an exercise successfully undertaken in the united states last year , in an effort to restore market confidence . china had announced that it would allow a gradual appreciation of its currency . and congressional negotiators had agreed on a far-reaching overhaul of financial regulations .     but those accomplishments did not alter the mix of lagging growth , heavy debts and anxious voters that pushed european leaders to press for austerity .     \u201cthe u.s. may be concentrated on premature fiscal tightening , but most other countries are looking with a nervous eye to the sovereign debt mess in europe , \u201d said kenneth s. rogoff , a harvard economist and former i.m.f . chief economist . \u201caiming for a gradually improving debt-to-g.d.p . ratio by 2016 is hardly wild-eyed fiscal conservatism. \u201d     in that light , the g-20 outcome was a victory for chancellor angela merkel of germany , who argued that without actions to rein in spending , investors would drive up governments \u2019 borrowing costs , as they did in greece .     mr. obama said , \u201cwe helped to draft this communiqu\u00e9 , which reflects our policies , \u201d and added , \u201ckeep in mind that we had already proposed a long time ago that we were going to cut our deficits in half by 2013. \u201d     he continued , \u201cwe can \u2019 t all rush to the exits at the same time. \u201d but he also said that for all the talk of german austerity , it was actually reducing its spending gradually , and not any more quickly than the united states .     while aides to mr. obama said that the g-20 statement was in line with budget plans he had already announced , others said it was a move toward austerity .     \u201cthe best thing that countries with fiscal challenges can do is to show that they can live within their means , \u201d george osborne , britain \u2019 s chancellor of the exchequer , said . \u201cbarack obama has recognized that. \u201d     the mood here was far less anxious than in november 2008 , when the g-20 leaders converged for the first time , in washington , to battle a still-raging financial crisis . but it was hardly cheery .     while china did not make any new commitments , the g-20 statement appealed to china to increase spending on infrastructure , let its currency fluctuate and strengthen social protections .     those actions are part of what economists call rebalancing \u2014 a reorientation of the world economy to be less reliant on debt-financed spending by north american and western european consumers . china is the largest growth engine but its workers save too much and spend too little , some economists say .     at china \u2019 s urging , the g-20 leaders removed from their joint statement a proposed clause that would have praised china for agreeing to greater exchange-rate flexibility . mr. harper said he understood china \u2019 s wish not to be singled out , for either criticism or praise , but added , \u201cwhen you make commitments on the world stage , you will be held accountable for them. \u201d\n"}, {"url":

of state , mrs clinton set up an email server at her home in chappaqua , new york , that she used for all work and personal emails during her four years in office .     she did not use , or even
