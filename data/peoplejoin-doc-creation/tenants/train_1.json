states have increased nearly 30 % since 1999 , putting a major spotlight on suicide prevention awareness among the american public .     reidenberg said that in times of tragedy , one of the main suicide prevention goals is to make sure that people have the right information as a means to prevent another death .     \" we need to have people understand that just because there was a high

struggling with thoughts of suicide or are impacted by the recent celebrity deaths to call the national suicide prevention lifeline or reach out to a local crisis center .     \" we know that one of the best ways to help in people feeling disconnected is allowing them to feel connection with other human beings , \" monroe said .     jill harkavy-friedman , vice president of american foundation for suicide prevention , said that these are teachable moments to educate the public about prevention .     \" what we want to make sure is that people struggling identify with suicide prevention options rather than the people who have died by suicide , \" she said .     that ' s why an uptick in calls to a suicide prevention hotline can be positive because it means that those individuals are
