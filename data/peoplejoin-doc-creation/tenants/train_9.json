( associated press )     new york ( ap ) \u2014 the common stereotype has teens glued to their phones 24-7. but nearly 60 percent of teens in the u.s. have actually taken a break from social media \u2014 the bulk of them voluntarily , a new survey found .     the poll , from the associated press-norc center for public affairs research , surveyed teens aged 13 to 17 and found that most value the feeling of connection with friends and family that social media provides . a much smaller number associate it with negative emotions , such as being overwhelmed or needing to always show their best selves .     the survey , released thursday , found that teens ' social media breaks are typically a week or longer , and that boys are more likely to take longer breaks .     teens were allowed to cite multiple reasons for their breaks . nearly two-thirds of teens who took a break cited at least one voluntary reason . amanda lenhart , the lead researcher and an expert on young people and technology use , said she was surprised by this , as it counters the broader narrative that teens are \" handcuffed \" to their social media profiles .     today ' s teenagers might not recall a time before social media . myspace was founded in 2003. had it survived , it would be 14 years old today . facebook is a year younger . instagram launched in 2010. for an adult to understand what it might be like for someone who grew up with it to step back from social media , consider disconnecting from email \u2014 or your phone \u2014 for a couple of weeks .     among the teens who took voluntary breaks , 38 percent did so because social media was getting in the way of work or school . nearly a quarter said they were tired of \" the conflict and drama \" and 20 percent said they were tired of having to keep up with what ' s going on .     nearly half of teens who took a break did so involuntarily . this included 38 percent who said their parents took away their phone or computer and 17 percent who said their phone was lost , broken or stolen .     the involuntary break \" is sort of its own challenge , \" lenhart said . \" they feel that they are missing out , detached from important social relationships ( as well as ) news and information . \"     about 35 percent of teens surveyed said they have not taken a break , citing such worries as missing out and being disconnected from friends . some said they need social media for school or extracurricular activities .     \" i like to see what my friends and family are up to , \" said lukas goodwin , 14 , who uses instagram and snapchat every day . he said he took a break from instagram \" a few years ago \" but not recently . now , he says , \" i wouldn ' t want to take a break from them . \"     among the survey ' s other findings :     \u2014 lower income teens were more likely to take social media breaks than their wealthier counterparts , and their breaks tended to last longer . the study points out that educators who use social media in the classroom need to understand that not every teen is online and connected all the time .     \u2014 boys were more likely to feel overloaded with information on social media , while girls were more likely to feel they always have to show the best version of themselves .     \u2014 teens who took breaks typically did so across the board , checking out of facebook , snapchat and all other services all at once . and they were no more or less likely to take breaks from social media based on the type of services they use .     \u2014 although they felt relief and were happy to be away from social media for a while , most teens said things went back to how they were before once they returned to social media .     the ap-norc poll was conducted online and by phone from dec. 7 to 31. a sample of parents with teenage children was drawn from a probability-based panel of norc at the university of chicago . parents then gave permission for their children to be interviewed . the panel , amerispeak , is designed to be representative of the u.s. population . the margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 4.6 percentage points .     ___     online :     ap-norc : http://www.apnorc.org\n"}], "cassie": [{"url": "file://train/9/1/0", "title": "train/9/1/0", "content": "article excerpt     europeans traded
