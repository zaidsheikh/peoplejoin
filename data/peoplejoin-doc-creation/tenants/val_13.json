( associated press )     a statement from the body , the investigative committee , didn ' t address the possibility seen as likely by many of nemtsov ' s supporters \u2014 that he was killed for being one of president vladimir putin ' s most adamant and visible critics .     the 55-year-old nemtsov was gunned down friday near midnight as he walked on a bridge near the kremlin with a female companion . the killing came just a few hours after a radio interview in which he denounced putin ' s \" mad , aggressive \" policies and the day before he was to help lead a rally protesting russia ' s actions in the ukraine crisis and the economic crisis at home .     after his death , organizers canceled the rally and instead called for a demonstration to mourn him on sunday in central moscow . the city gave quick approval for that gathering , in contrast to its usual slow and grudging permission for opposition rallies .     the investigative committee said it was looking into whether nemtsov had been killed as a \" sacrificial victim for those who do not shun any method for achieving their political goals , \" a suggestion echoing the comments by putin ' s spokesman and other russian politicians that the attack was a \" provocation \" against the state .     it also said it was considering whether there was \" personal enmity \" toward him in his domestic life . state-controlled tv and kremlin-friendly media outlets on saturday gave considerable attention to nemtsov ' s companion , identifying her as a ukrainian model 30 years his junior and showing photos of her in alluring poses . the investigative committee said the pair were headed for nemtsov ' s apartment .     the statement also said it was investigating whether the killing was connected to the ukraine conflict , where russia-backed separatists have been fighting ukrainian forces since last april , or whether there was a connection to islamic extremism .     nemtsov had been one of putin ' s most visible critics and his death hit other members of the opposition hard . the mourning march on sunday could serve to galvanize the beleaguered and marginalized opposition , or it could prove to be a brief catharsis after which emotions dissipate .     through the morning , hundreds of people came to the site of nemtsov ' s death to lay flowers .     nemtsov was working on a report presenting evidence that he believed proved russia ' s direct involvement in the separatist rebellion that has raged in eastern ukraine since april . moscow denies backing the rebels with troops and sophisticated weapons .     putin ordered russia ' s top law enforcement chiefs to personally oversee the investigation of nemtsov ' s killing .     \" putin noted that this cruel murder has all the makings of a contract hit and is extremely provocative , \" presidential spokesman dmitry peskov said in remarks carried by russian news agencies .     ramzan kadyrov , the putin-backed leader of chechnya , raised the suggestion into an accusation .     \" there ' s no doubt that nemtsov ' s killing was organized by western special services , trying by any means to create internal conflict in russia , \" he said on instagram .     president barack obama said the russian people \" lost one of the most dedicated and eloquent defenders of their rights . \"     german chancellor angela merkel praised nemtsov ' s courage in criticizing kremlin policies , and urged putin to insure that the killers are brought to justice , her spokesman steffen seibert said .     former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev echoed the suggestion that the killing was a provocation . \" it ' s an attempt to push the situation into complications , maybe even to destabilizing the situation in the country , \" he was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency .     communist party leader gennady zyuganov agreed . \" it ' s a provocation ; for big fires , sacrificial figures are necessary , \" interfax quoted him as saying .     nemtsov frequently assailed the government ' s inefficiency , rampant corruption and ukraine policy .     in an interview with the sobesednik newspaper , nemtsov said earlier this month that his 86-year old mother was afraid that putin could have him killed . asked if he had such fears himself , he responded : \" if i were afraid i wouldn ' t have led an opposition party . \"     speaking on radio just a few hours before his death , he accused putin of plunging russia into crisis by his \" mad , aggressive and deadly policy of war against ukraine . \"     kasyanov , the former prime minister , said he was shocked .     \" in the 21st century , a leader of the opposition is being demonstratively shot just outside the walls of the kremlin ! \" .     \" this is a monstrous tragedy and a loss for us all , \" alexei navalny , russia ' s most prominent opposition figure , said on his facebook page . he is currently on a 15-day jail sentence for handing out leaflets without authorization .     \" the country is rolling into the abyss , \" kasyanov , the former prime minister , told reporters as nemtsov ' s body , placed in a plastic bag , was removed on a rainy and cold night , as the kremlin bells chimed nearby .     nemtsov served as a regional governor and then a deputy prime minister in the 1990s and once was seen as a possible successor to boris yeltsin , russia ' s first elected president .     nemtsov was widely liked for his good humor , larger-than-life character and quick wit , but he and other top opposition figures long have been purged from state television and steadily marginalized by the kremlin .     ___     associated press writers vladimir isachenkov and laura mills in moscow and jake pearson in new york contributed to

mont-tremblant , que. -- richard henry bain left montreal a couple of years ago to set up a fishing lodge in the mountains north of the city and dreams of expanding his business were apparently delayed by bureaucratic roadblocks .     hours before gunshots rang out at a parti quebecois rally on tuesday , bain had been sent a note informing him that his request for an ice-fishing licence at his lodge had been put off .     bain is known locally as the friendly scottish guy who occasionally wears a kilt . he has had his picture in the paper standing next to celine dion . he ' s the generous neighbour who shares a freshly caught trout and drives passengers around in his military vehicle decorated with mickey mouse decals .     the locals are now shocked by news that has made international headlines .     police sources confirmed they arrested a suspect by that name in the montreal shooting that left one person dead and made headlines around the world .     the suspect in tuesday ' s attack was wearing a housecoat and black facemask when he was tackled by police . he shouted about an awakening of english-speaking quebecers as he was whisked away .     a hospital statement said wednesday a man in police custody was undergoing an evaluation . police said there could be charges laid in the case thursday .     a facebook page says a richard henry bain runs a riverside lodge near mont-tremblant , que . a website for the business was taken down wednesday .     bain , 62 , was in constant contact with officials at the local municipality , la conception , over the past several months as he tried to expand his business , according to the village manager .     he had applied to add licences for hunting and ice fishing at the lodge , marie-france brisson said in an interview .     the village received a copy of a letter addressed to bain from a biologist conducting an environmental assessment .     it said the ice-fishing licence needed further study before being approved .     the village received its copy tuesday -- hours before the shooting . brisson said bain may have received the letter the same day .     \" he was a man that was calm and polite who could also be frank , \" brisson said .     \" he could sometimes be frustrated ( with the bureaucratic process ) . \"     there is no evidence of any link between the man ' s business interests and the shooting .     neighbours who live across the highway from the entrance to bain ' s property couldn ' t believe the friendly , generous man they know as \" rick \" or \" scottish \" could be linked to such an incident .     bain , who was occasionally seen wearing a kilt , would sometimes down beers with locals in the rural mountainous area close to the popular mont-tremblant park .     he wasn ' t all business , all the time .     a photo in a local newspaper from earlier this year shows bain , dressed in a dapper black suit and white-collared shirt , standing alongside celine dion in las vegas .     the newspaper , info du nord tremblant , said bain and another man , david bain , won vip tickets at a local fundraising auction to see the singer last january .     several people in the area said bain started inviting anglers to fish for trout two years ago on the sweeping property in a dense forest .     his clients would park their vehicles on a grassy piece of land alongside the highway . bain would drive them several kilometres up a bumpy trail into the backwoods aboard his three-axle military truck .     bain ' s imposing army truck sat on the edge of the highway wednesday , a couple of hundred metres from a locked gate leading to the property , which is on crown land .     the olive-coloured truck catches the attention of passersby . it has mickey mouse decals on both doors to the cab . the image of mickey features moose antlers instead of his trademark round mouse ears .     neighbour real papineau said bain was focused on attracting more business and asked him in the spring to hand out some pamphlets publicizing the fishing camp .     to return the favour , papineau said bain brought him a large brook trout as a thank you .     \" incredible , \" he said , shaking his head in disbelief when a reporter told him that bain ' s name was linked to the killing .     \" he was always in a good mood . i never heard him make any negative remarks . \"     marc-andre cyr , the owner of a campground near bain ' s lodge , also said he was friendly and never showed any anger toward french-speaking quebecers .     cyr said they occasionally had a beer together . they always spoke french .     \" he ' s someone i would meet from time to time , \" he said . \" we never talked politics . \"     he said he met bain just over a year ago and that the man was new to the region . bain joined the local chamber of commerce about a year ago . police sources say he had relocated from montreal .     another man , dominic bouffard , who works for the local paper , said bain is a successful businessman who occasionally took out ads to promote his lodge . bouffard said he tried hard to network with local politicians and business leaders .     \" he did everything he could to meet people in the municipality , in the ( mont-tremblant area ) , and everywhere , \" bouffard said .     -- with files from benjamin shingler and
