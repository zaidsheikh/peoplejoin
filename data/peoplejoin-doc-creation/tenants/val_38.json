wildlife refuge near burns since jan. 2 , finicum and several other men are shown leafing through boxes of documents belonging to the paiute tribe .     finicum encourages tribe members to meet with the militia group to reclaim items \" rotting \" and \" wasting away \" at the government refuge , which is home to thousands of paiute artifacts , including tools and weapons , as well as burial grounds . in the video , finicum notes decades-old papers strewn across the floor , and one box allegedly containing a rat ' s nest .     \" we are concerned about the way artifacts are stored here , the paiute ' s artifacts , and so we ' re reaching out to the paiute tribe to say we need to open up a communication , \" finicum said . \" we want to make sure that these things are returned to their rightful owners and that they ' re taken care of . \"     despite the militiamen ' s assertion that they intend to save paiute artifacts from the government , tribe members argue it is the militiamen that their belongings need protecting from . in a letter to the u.s. fish and wildlife service last week , the tribe requested assistance in protecting paiute artifacts from the armed protesters , calling for an inventory of items in the refuge , and criminal prosecution of the group under the archeological resources protection act .     see also : oregon militants want you to stop sending them

also contrary to the militia group ' s mission to transfer control of public land from the federal government to ranchers , the paiute argue the refuge land is a part of the tribe ' s ancestral territory and have refused to meet with the group .     other members of the community surrounding the wildlife refuge have also denounced the actions of the militia members , many of whom are not from oregon . harney county judge steve grasty said he plans to hold leader ammon bundy \u2014 son of notorious nevada rancher cliven bundy \u2014 responsible for the cost of providing security measures for the refuge , a bill that could be as high as $ 70,000 a day .     see also : the ranchers at the center of the oregon standoff     in total , the standoff has cost taxpayers nearly a half million dollars , according to oregon gov . kate brown . in letters to the white house and department of justice this week , brown requested assistance from the fbi and other law enforcement in removing the militia group from federal land , oregon public broadcasting reported .     \" for the citizens of harney county and indeed all oregonians , i must insist on a swift resolution to this matter , \" brown wrote . \" efforts to negotiate have not been successful , and now it is unclear what steps , if any , federal authorities might take to bring this untenable situation to an end and

bundy and other armed militants occupying the malheur wildlife refuge , \u201cif the occupiers disturb , damage , remove , alter , or deface any archaeological resource on the refuge property .     there are approximately 4,000 artifacts belonging to the tribe in the buildings the militants are holding . the occupation is entering its third week .     the tribe is demanding federal action under both the archaeological resources protection act of 1979 and a \" protection against bad men \u201d provision in the treaty the tribe signed with the united states in 1868.     under arpa , a federal law authorizing law enforcement and penalties in the defense of archeological sites on public land , removing artifacts is a felony offense . first time offenders can be fined up to $ 20,000 and imprisoned for up to one year . second time offenders can be fined up to $ 100,000 and imprisoned for up to 5 years .     bundy supporters have damaged native american archaeological sites before , most notably , when they drove atvs through a canyon trail in utah in protest of protected federal lands trampling the ruins of homes belonging to the ancient puebloans . also , the southern paiute tribes in nevada have accused the bundy family of defacing ancient paiute petroglyphs in gold butte . incidentally , southern paiute community members held a rally last week in las vegas in support of the burns paiute tribe .     \u201ci understand they took a bulldozer and built a line around the refuge headquarters , \u201d roderique said . she notes that in the past when a water line was put in at the refuge the tribe \u2019 s cultural resources department oversaw the work done to make sure no artifacts or sites were disturbed . \u201cwe have a good working relationship with them . that is , the relationship has evolved for the better. \u201d     the community has also reached out to her , \u201ci \u2019 ve gotten calls from ranching families who support the tribe . they \u2019 ve seen the [ paiute ] campsites out there . they \u2019 ve been in that area and they know where things are . you can \u2019 t go and bulldoze things . i don \u2019 t know what these people are doing if they are doing things to just get a rise or to be martyr \u2014 all they are doing is making enemies out of the people they professed to support. \u201d     carla burnside , the u.s. fish and wildlife service ' s archaeologist at the refuge , has told the tribe that she has seen pictures in news reports of militants sitting in her office , even at her desk with files open that contain sensitive information about archaeological sites belonging to the tribe .     this past week , the burns paiute tribal council passed a resolution to formally recognize malheur lake and its shoreline as \u201csacred places and traditional cultural properties \u201d of the tribe and cited the tribe \u2019 s own \u201caboriginal lands protection policy \u201d which covers \u201cthe tribe ' s aboriginal territory beyond current trust lands ( resolution 2006-12 ) which defines cultural resources as : \u2018any material objects of human life or activities that are of cultural , historical ,

government over $ 1 million in unpaid grazing fees on public land , has offered to meet with the tribe but the tribe says he has no right to hold their history hostage and have refused to grant him even the appearance of such authority by meeting with him .     \u201csome of the members of the community were open to them , \u201d roderique says , \u201cwhen they first came but now the county chained and locked everything up and said no you can \u2019 t have your meeting in town. \u201d     harney county officials have stated they will not allow the militants to use any county-owned building for fear of more takeovers of public property .     \u201cthey tried to ask us for our gathering center and our facility was booked up . we just kind of laughed and said they want to use our ' savage ' facilities ? \u201d     roderique was referencing a \u201charney county committee of safety \u201d website made by supporters of the takeover who profess to exist \u201cto secure the property and lives of the association members from threats from the savages. \u201d     the support , however , has been \u201coverwhelming \u201d says roderique . the tribe has received letters of support from other tribes like the confederated tribes of warm springs and the klamath tribe of northern california and even farther away from first nations tribes in canada and many native american organizations and mexican american organizations .     \u201cthose things are so empowering . when we had our press conference we didn \u2019 t know the attendance and response was going to be as big as it was . i really appreciate all the native people for their concern because it could be any one of us that this could happen to. \u201d     roderique told ictmn that it is not only title to the land that matters to her but the plants and wildlife on the land some of which are going extinct . \u201cwe are the wadatika people . the plants we are named after grow on the banks of the harney and malheur lake . if they put cattle in there [ bundy has called for the land to be returned to private ranchers ] they will destroy these plants. \u201d     \u201cas a little girl , we \u2019 d go along the river in the marshes and gather waterfowl to eat in the spring . we \u2019 d make our little tule baskets . i was told by elders if there are three eggs , take one . leave the other two . one is going to grow up and fulfill its life . one is going to be taken by predators . so you never just go and throw all the eggs in your basket , you only , only take one . find another nest and find another one . that way there was continuation of the species . our people have been doing that for thousands of years and those are the things that are taught to the next generation . we restrict our hunting and gathering accordingly to ensure there is a future . we don \u2019 t have the attitude that the bundys have. \u201d     this weekend , the first occupier was arrested in burns at a safeway
