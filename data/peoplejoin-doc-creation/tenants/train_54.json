\" he asked .     \" i saw in the news that they were going to be selling parts of the company , \" she responded . \" can we buy some ? \"     since then , mr. supple has been trying to find a way to take $ 25,000 he has saved for her college fund and purchase facebook stock . \" she doesn ' t need this money for another eight years , \" says mr. supple . \" if it goes the google route , i ' ll be in good shape . \"     although he thought facebook was a strong investment , mr. supple had been burned before , having lost some money in a ponzi scheme , he says . he wanted to be sure that he was being more careful this time before betting so much on one company .     on jan. 17 , mr. supple tried to dive in . two former facebook employees were selling 70,000 shares in an auction on sharespost inc. , one of the secondary markets for facebook shares . the bidding started at $ 31 a share . he bid $ 32.01 . \" jim , i ' m gonna be honest with you , you ' re not gonna get it , very rarely does it sell for the minimum , \" mr. supple says he was told by his sharespost broker .     mr. supple works for a manhattan-based company called snap interactive that creates a software application that allows singles to go on facebook and find dates . over a jan. 18 dinner of burgers and beer at the new york steakhouse del frisco ' s , mr. supple asked his boss , cliff lerner , what he thought about buying up facebook in the secondary market .     \" you know , there is a very high minimum to get into the secondary market , \" mr. lerner cautioned mr. supple . mr. supple said he could figure out a way , between his 401k and an ira fund and the college savings , to squeeze together the $ 100,000 minimum recommended by sharespost . \" am i out of my mind ? \" mr. supple asked mr. lerner . \" no , i think you ' re gonna kill it in this thing , \" responded mr. lerner .     mr. supple lost the sharespost auction . it closed on jan. 20 for $ 34 a share , less than $ 2 above his bid .     just two weeks later , facebook filed for its ipo with the securities and exchange commission , driving the price of secondary market shares up drastically . the next auction was $ 44 a share , too expensive for mr. supple . mr. supple turned his energy away from the secondary market and began plotting how to buy shares on the day of the ipo , or shortly after .     on april 9 , just after the roadshow kicked off , mr. supple said he was getting concerned about the frenzy and rethinking his plan to buy on the day of the ipo .     \" here in new york , it ' s on every single news channel , it ' s in all the newspapers that the roadshow has started and [ facebook chief executive mark ] zuckerberg was here in new york , \" he said at the time . \" i ' m going to sit on the sidelines on ipo day , \" mr. supple decided . \" we ' re going to have to wait until the smoke clears . \"     * * *     el cajon , calif. \u2014 on jan. 30 , amid reports that facebook would file for its ipo within days , high school senior brandon hyatt scrawled an exuberant message to the online forum of his investment club at grossmont high school , under the heading \" buy facebook ! ! ! ! \"     the note clued technology teacher and club supervisor todd benrud into the frenzy that would follow . when the club next met that wednesday , mr. benrud faced some 10 teenagers who thought they could buy shares that day .     every monday and wednesday at lunchtime , mr. benrud converts his technology classroom into the trading floor of the charity student investment project , a nonprofit student-run investment club . a live feed of a financial tv show fills the projection screen . students each take a computer to research investments for their real-money pool of $ 2,900 .     when mr. benrud called an initial vote on whether to pursue facebook shares , every hand shot up , even after mr. benrud told students that they couldn ' t get shares immediately . since the club ' s rules don ' t allow it to put more than 10 % of their money into any one stock , they would only be able to buy a few shares , depending on where it was priced .     in an attempt to help the club buy at the ipo price , mr. benrud met with a morgan stanley broker in march and showed interest in giving the brokerage his retirement account . at the end of their hour-and-a-half meeting , he told the broker that he had one more question . he said the broker slumped his shoulders and said one word : \" facebook ? \"     the broker told mr. benrud that neither he nor the club had enough money to qualify . \" it really took the wind out of their sails , \" mr. benrud says of his club members . \" they immediately started asking , ' what else can we do? ' \"     students began to get frustrated as the weeks wound on without more news of the ipo date . in mid-april , when facebook said it would acquire instagram , which makes a photo-sharing app , for $ 1 billion , several students questioned the deal . antonio robles , a junior in the club , lamented that instagram \" wasn ' t even making money \" and wondered if investors would think that mr. zuckerberg had poor judgment .     nonetheless , the students decided it was time to vote on whether or not to buy facebook shares . a plan to buy two shares on the open market the morning of the ipo \u2014 no matter the price \u2014 and sell later that afternoon passed the club \u2014 eight in favor , one against , with one abstention .     the week before the roadshow , the students decided to hold a second vote \u2014 this time to buy two shares in the morning but sell only one in the afternoon , keeping the other indefinitely . the measure passed \u2014 six ayes to one abstention .     after hearing the week before the ipo that some facebook shares would be available to small investors at the ipo price , mr. benrud made one last attempt to get ipo shares through the club ' s wells fargo broker but was told his club didn ' t qualify .     on tuesday , grossmont high school ' s mr. hyatt , the student who started the facebook discussion , posted to his club ' s forum again , noting that facebook ' s projected debut share price of $ 28 to $ 35 would let his club buy more than the two shares they planned on . ( facebook raised the price range on monday. ) the group ended up voting to buy up to four shares on the open market , depending on the price , and sell half of what they get the same afternoon .     \" every single person in the investment club has a facebook \" page , says junior adam sturgeon . \" we relate to it . \"     * * *     berwyn , pa. \u2014 chris baggini , a hedge-fund and mutual-fund manager , was in new york meeting with clients and media on feb. 1 , the day facebook would release a first glimpse at its financials . at about 9 in the morning , sitting in a booth in a posh dining room at the royalton hotel in midtown manhattan , he gushed about the company ' s prospects . \" of course we ' re interested , \" he said .     mr. baggini ' s firm , turner investment partners , in 2004 had managed to grab 700,000 shares of google at its ipo and make a $ 10.5 million paper profit for investors on the first day of trading . the firm now manages about $ 13.4 billion in mutual funds , hedge funds and separate accounts for institutions .     even before seeing facebook ' s financials , mr. baggini thought it likely that turner would be involved . he noted americans spend 16 % of their time online on facebook and said that it had the chance of being the biggest ipo of the decade .     after hearing that morgan stanley and goldman sachs would set the roadshow schedule , he started to call and email bankers at both companies regularly . neither gave hints on when the roadshow would begin , and mr. baggini said it felt like they were \" walking on eggshells . \"     in late april , mr. baggini traveled to san francisco to meet prospective clients . there , too , he was met by a bevy of questions about what the company thought about facebook and whether they would get in on the ipo .     facebook ' s s-1 filing brought a new round of questions . mr. baggini was pleased that its research and development expenditures had ticked up but wasn ' t sure why revenue growth per user had slowed .     \" the question becomes the level of interest . is facebook marginally exciting , very exciting or extremely exciting ? \" he said . \" right now , i think we ' re at ' very exciting .

hong kong welcomed new students to campus with its newly-minted president promising to help them and staff cope with the tragedy .     speaking at an inauguration ceremony for first-year students at hku \u2019 s campus in sai ying pun on wednesday , its president and vice chancellor zhang xiang said many students would have heard of the death .     without naming the professor , zhang said : \u201ci \u2019 m sure you are as saddened and shocked as i am. \u201d     zhang , who took office last month , said the details were uncertain but the university would offer support to all students and staff .     \u201cour thoughts are with those who are affected and the university will be providing the necessary assistance to them at this very difficult time , \u201d zhang said to the more than 1,300 staff and students attending the ceremony at lee shau kee lecture centre \u2019 s grand hall .     on tuesday , it emerged that associate professor cheung kie-chung from the department of mechanical engineering had been arrested over the suspected murder of his wife .     her decomposing body was found in a suitcase placed in a wooden box in his office at haking wong building on the main campus .     investigators suspected his wife was killed in their home at wei lun hall \u2013 one of the university \u2019 s residential halls \u2013 about a four-minute car ride from cheung \u2019 s office .     wei lun hall is one of the three halls on sassoon road . it is a mixed dormitory in a quiet neighbourhood and houses mostly undergraduate students . the hall is particularly popular with medical or nursing students as it is opposite the medical school and its teaching hospital , queen mary hospital .     cheung was the warden of the hall , where he lived with his family , including his son and daughter .     one member of staff said cheung rarely spoke of his wife or family . \u201che just brought his wife along once for a staff union dinner , \u201d said the source . \u201cother than that i barely remember her. \u201d     the post learned his daughter , in her mid-20s , had graduated from a british university about two years ago and once worked at hku .     during the ceremony , professor lung ying-tai , hung leung hau ling distinguished fellow in humanities in hku and guest of honour at the ceremony , also alluded to the event .     she also called on students , both male and female , to be feminists .     she said men should realise women \u2019 s rights were part of human rights and \u201csomething fundamental \u201d .     \u201cif you are a woman , be a feminist , out of self-protection and self-interest , \u201d she added . \u201cyou are protected when you are respected. \u201d     lung said respect had to be earned and women could do this by asserting themselves . being a feminist did not make a woman lose her femininity but instead , made her stronger , she said .     lung admitted she had considered omitting a section of her pre-written speech after the tragedy , but instead pressed on , believing it carried a more pertinent message than ever .     student union president davin wong said the school was providing counselling for wei lun hall residents .     he urged hku \u2019 s more than 4,000 first-year students to \u201cnever settle for rules and norms \u201d .     \u201cwe should be the ones who mould society instead of the other way around , \u201d he said .     \u201cour city \u2019 s future is at stake , yet i believe it is still in our hands. \u201d     he also paid tribute to students or alumni including alex chow yong-kang , former union vice-president who was jailed for a few months for his involvement in the pro-democracy occupy protests ; edward leung tin-kei , a pro-independence activist currently behind bars over his involvement in the mong kok riot ; and billy fung jing-en , former student union president sentenced to community service for his role in a siege of a university council meeting .     \u201cthey have accomplished astonishing achievements in their young age , and of course , i am looking forward to more heroes rising in your generation , our generations , \u201d wong said .     he added that as cheung was the university student union \u2019 s honorary treasurer , responsible for its finances , the union \u2019 s councillors would hold an emergency meeting on thursday to discuss next steps .     he said he was not close to cheung but found him \u201ca kind and helpful person \u201d .     despite the tragedy , the atmosphere in the hall where the ceremony was held was lighthearted with freshmen responding enthusiastically to speakers on stage .     at wei lun hall , a first-year student who had arrived from india two days earlier to stay at the dormitory said he was not affected by the incident .     \u201ci don \u2019 t think [ the case ] is a reflection of the university \u2019 s professors and it won \u2019 t affect what i think of campus safety , \u201d he said .     in an email to students and staff on wednesday afternoon , dr steven cannon , executive vice-president for administration and finance listed contact details for counselling services and said the seventh floor of haking wong building would be closed on wednesday . the office of the department of mechanical engineering would operate on the fifth floor of the same building in the meantime .     the department \u2019 s head , professor alfonso ngan hing-wan , said he was arranging for other staff members to teach courses assigned to cheung when the new school year begins next

season ' s hotel in boston , massachusetts may 8 , 2012.     new york/san francisco facebook inc increased the price range on its initial public offering an average of 14 percent to raise more than $ 12 billion , giving the world ' s no . 1 social network a valuation potentially exceeding $ 100 billion .     the company , founded eight years ago by mark zuckerberg in a harvard dorm room , raised the target range to between $ 34 and $ 38 per share in response to strong demand , from $ 28 to $ 35 , according to a filing with the u.s. securities and exchange commission on tuesday .     that would value facebook at roughly $ 93 billion to $ 104 billion , rivaling the market capitalization of internet powerhouses such as amazon.com inc , and exceeding that of hewlett-packard co and dell inc combined .     facebook also extended the time frame for its $ 1 billion acquisition of mobile app maker instagram , projecting that the deal would close in 2012 instead of closing in the second quarter as it had previously indicated .     facebook provided no reason for the change , though a source familiar with the matter told reuters last week that the u.s. federal trade commission has reached out to google inc and twitter as part of the agency ' s standard review for deals of that size .     the price increase indicates intense market demand , which means facebook ' s shares are likely to see a big pop on their first day of trading on the nasdaq on friday , analysts said .     \" it ' s confounding but the evidence is that if companies raise the range , they will pop more , \" said josef schuster , founder of chicago-based financial services firm ipox schuster llc . \" it signals that there is such a strong demand that it will create a momentum for other investors who want to jump on . \"     facebook said in its latest filing that it arrived at the higher ipo price range after one week of marketing the offering - part of a cross-country \" road show \" in which ceo zuckerberg has occasionally taken the stage to lay out his vision for the company ' s money-making potential and its top priorities .     the facebook range hike , coupled with strong results from internet and social media players groupon inc and china ' s renren inc overnight , contributed to a dotcom rally on wall street on tuesday .     shares of pandora media inc were up 6.9 percent at $ 10.50 in afternoon trading , while zynga inc was up 8.3 percent at $ 8.61 . groupon was up 13.7 percent at $ 13.33 , while renren gained 9.5 percent to $ 6.01 . yelp inc stock was up 7.5 pct at $ 21.55 .     in the biggest-ever ipo to emerge from silicon valley , facebook will raise $ 12.1 billion based on the midpoint price of $ 36 and the 337.4 million shares on offer , or 12.3 percent of the company .     at this midpoint , facebook would be valued at roughly 27 times its 2011 annual revenue , or 99 times earnings . when google went public in 2004 at a valuation of $ 23 billion , it was valued at 16 times trailing revenue and 218 times earnings . apple inc , meanwhile , went public in 1980 at a valuation of 25 times revenue and 102 times earnings .     wall street had expected facebook to increase its price range , with investors eager to get a slice of a strong consumer brand . the ipo road show began last week and has drawn crowds of investors from coast to coast .     facebook plans to close the books on its ipo later on tuesday , two days ahead of schedule , a source familiar with the deal told reuters on monday . it is scheduled to price its shares on thursday and begin trading on the nasdaq on friday .     the ipo is already \" well-oversubscribed , \" which is why the company will close its books earlier than expected , the source said .     facebook ' s capital-raising target far outstrips other big internet ipos . google raised just shy of $ 2 billion in 2004 , while last year groupon tapped investors for $ 700 million and zynga raked in $ 1 billion .     the ipo comes amid concerns from some investors that facebook has not yet figured out a way to make money from an increasing number of users who access the social network on mobile devices such as smartphones . revenue growth from facebook ' s online advertising business has also slowed in recent months .     company executives met with prospective investors in chicago on monday and were slated to travel to kansas city , missouri , and denver , before returning to facebook ' s menlo park , california , headquarters .     a host of wall street banks are underwriting facebook ' s
