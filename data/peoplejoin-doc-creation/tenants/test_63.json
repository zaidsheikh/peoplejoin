forehead : skull crushed from an unknown cause . \"     records show that his remains were shipped home by freight and , after a funeral at st. bridget parish in east falls , buried without a headstone , stacked upon his great-grandparents ' graves .     and there , presumably , his body had lain , undisturbed for generations .     since the shuttering of the school two years ago , forensic anthropologists and archaeologists from the university of south florida have been probing and digging up the cemetery by the school , accounting for victims .     now , the inquiry had taken them to philadelphia .     once the nation ' s largest boys ' school , and later known as arthur g. dozier school for boys , the institution in marianna was closed after a 2009 newspaper investigation revealed a century of abuse and failed reform .     the articles in the st. petersburg times spurred investigations by the florida department of law enforcement and the u.s. department of justice .     hundreds of men stepped forward to share their horrors .     they told of beatings , torture , disappearances . a former staff member told of \" boy hunts \" in which guards chased runaways with guns .     the men told of burials in the makeshift cemetery , which , the newspaper articles noted , was marked only by crooked rows of pipe crosses .     that ' s when south florida professor erin kimmerle got involved . a renowned forensic anthropologist , kimmerle led the united nations effort to exhume mass graves in the former yugoslavia , and worked with the smithsonian institution to return american indian remains to their tribes .     using ground-penetrating radar , kimmerle ' s team discovered 55 graves in the woods - nearly double the number the state had identified .     as dna analysis continues to identify remains in florida , finally allowing proper burials for families , kimmerle turned her attention to curry , whose death was not mentioned in florida ' s 2009 investigative report .     \" he seems to be sort of lost to time , \" she said .     boys fled almost daily from the school , kimmerle said . curry was one of 10 who were found dead after running away . some , like curry , were killed by blunt-force trauma . others died from exposure to the elements , or were found shot or run down by cars .     no one , she said , was ever brought to justice in any of the deaths .     locals , she said , sometimes joined in the hunts and were paid with meat from the school ' s farm or other goods produced at the school . but mostly , her research shows , the bounties were paid in cash .     records do not detail what drove curry south . he had lived on torresdale avenue with his grandmother after his parents died when he was about 7. according to inquirer archives , his father , thomas , shot his mother , alma , during a quarrel at their home on new year ' s day 1916 , then shot himself . two days later the father died .     in florida , the boy was sentenced for delinquency by a dade county judge , the records show , \" until further notice by court . \"     from surviving records , curry was either 15 or 17 in december 1925.     kimmerle believes he likely followed the railroad tracks west , leading to the bridge .     once the backhoe had dug about six feet down , the team used a rod to sense the top of the crate that curry ' s coffin had been buried inside .     kimmerle and her graduate assistant , liotta noche-dowdy , then used hand trowels , and small brushes and spoons - which kimmerle pulled from an alice in wonderland pencil case she brought into the hole .     slowly , they brushed away the damp clay as if cleaning a dirty canvas , and the top of the crate began to emerge .     cpl . thomas mcandrew of the state police criminal investigation assessment unit looked on . in the months before the dig , mcandrew had sketched out a family tree for curry , using census records to find relatives of curry ' s in new jersey and pennsylvania , who offered what they could about the family history but knew little about thomas .     together , mcandrew and cpl . robert levan tracked down the location of the boy ' s grave . a death certificate found at old cathedral contradicted the florida coroner ' s report . it said curry had been hit by a train .     philadelphia assistant district attorney brendan o ' malley noted that detail in a petition filed in common pleas court this summer , requesting the excavation and a skeletal autopsy .     at first tuesday , the work seemed promising . the crate was partly collapsed , but was intact . if the bones were well-preserved , kimmerle might be able to discern a cause of death - whether it was accidental or inflicted , whether there were defensive wounds or signs of past abuse .     on the lid of the casket , kimmerle discovered thumbscrews similar to ones she found in the florida graves . she found a small metal cross and a tattered black decorative bow - remnants , she assumed , of a wreath .     they kept digging .     but what they found inside the casket was just more wood .     no bones , no outline of a skeleton in the dirt , no teeth nor hair , no evidence that a body had ever been buried in the coffin .     what they hit next was the nameplate for the next casket . it belonged to thomas curry ' s great-grandmother . and with that , the digging stopped .     the silence became shock as they came to realize what this likely meant : someone had shipped a coffin to philadelphia weighted down with wood and not the remains of a possible victim of crime .     theories were offered by the team gathered at the cemetery .     the school was known to bury boys quickly - so why would they send evidence of a crime ? perhaps curry ' s remains were among those found in the school cemetery .     records show the school shipped other dead boys back to their families . were those coffins empty too ?     \" but what about the funeral ? \" asked o ' malley , the prosecutor .     maybe , kimmerle said , holding the thumbscrews , the ribbon and the cross , the casket was never opened at the service .     although it is unlikely , she said , she cannot be certain that the body was not removed after it arrived in philadelphia .     robert whomsley , the archdiocesan liaison for catholic cemeteries , had no answers .     \" we are all shaking our heads , \" he said .     in her research of the school , kimmerle said she had never encountered an empty coffin . instead of the autopsy , the team visited st. bridget ' s parish in search of more records . they found none .     she ' s hoping dna from curry ' s relatives help determine if the boy ' s remains were buried with the others in florida .     \" it is sad and disappointing , \" she said while standing by the grave , which had been refilled . \" rather to be able to shed light , it just raises so many more questions . \"     mnewall@phillynews.com

pregnant teen found dismembered in suitcases in 1976 -- kimmerle ' s team analyzed the woman ' s hair and teeth . via isotope testing , kimmerle was able to determine where the woman lived based on the water she consumed while alive .     though police have yet to solve the case , they now know she was born in europe and immigrated to the southeastern united states at age 12 , mcandrew said .

of the boys died so long ago , it ' s important to find their family members , kimmerle believes , if only because of the uncertainties surrounding their deaths and the controversy enveloping the supposed school where they died .     a dubious legacy     that bodies lay there was never a secret -- 31 rusty , white crosses marked the resting places of victims who died from a dormitory fire , influenza , pneumonia and other causes -- but kimmerle ' s team has found a total of 55 bodies there so far .     her team also has found records indicating that 22 boys who died at the school are unaccounted for . already , kimmerle and her colleagues have identified three sets of remains . one of those bodies was george owen smith , whose sister ovell krell , 85 , told cnn in august she was elated that the seven-decade mystery surrounding her brother ' s death was finally solved .     though ex-students provided detailed accounts of vicious beatings , sexual abuse and disappearances , guards and administrators who are still alive have denied the beatings occurred .     the state investigation in 2008 and 2009 said there was insufficient evidence of abuse at dozier , but dozens of men , many of them now senior citizens , have come forward with stories . a support group for ex-students , dubbed the white house boys , takes its moniker from the structure where boys say they were beaten with a leather strap attached to a wooden handle .     they were whipped until their underwear was embedded in their buttocks , the white house boys say . some were beaten unconscious . crying or screaming out would earn you extra lashes , they say .     so while this week ' s exhumation didn ' t answer any of the myriad questions surrounding dozier and its missing and dead boys , it was still an important part of the ongoing investigation , researchers and police said .     \" it definitely had to be done , \" mcandrew said . \" we had to at least open the grave if this investigation

"tel aviv \u2014 a weakened prime minister benjamin netanyahu emerged wednesday from israel \u2019 s national election likely to serve a third term , after voters on tuesday gave a surprising second place to a new centrist party founded by a television celebrity who emphasized kitchen-table issues like class size and apartment prices .     for mr. netanyahu , who entered the race an overwhelming favorite with no obvious challenger , the outcome was a humbling rebuke as his ticket lost seats in the new parliament . over all , his conservative team came in first , but it was the center , led by the political novice yair lapid , 49 , that emerged newly invigorated , suggesting that at the very least israel \u2019 s rightward tilt may be stalled .     mr. lapid , a telegenic celebrity whose father made a splash with his own short-lived centrist party a decade ago , ran a campaign that resonated with the middle class . his signature issue is a call to integrate the ultra-orthodox into the army and the work force .     perhaps as important , he also avoided antagonizing the right , having not emphasized traditional issues of the left , like the peace process . like a large majority of the israeli public , he supports a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict , but is skeptical of the palestinian leadership \u2019 s willingness to negotiate seriously ; he has called for a return to peace talks but has not made it a priority .     sensing his message of strength was not penetrating , mr. netanyahu posted a panicky message on facebook before the polls closed , saying , \u201cthe likud government is in danger , go vote for us for the sake of the country \u2019 s future. \u201d tuesday ended with mr. netanyahu reaching out again \u2014 this time to mr. lapid , israel \u2019 s newest kingmaker , offering to work with him as part of the \u201cbroadest coalition possible. \u201d     israel \u2019 s political hierarchy is only partly determined during an election . the next stage , when factions try to build a majority coalition , decides who will govern , how they will govern and for how long . while mr. lapid has signaled a willingness to work with mr. netanyahu , the ultimate coalition may bring together parties with such different ideologies and agendas that the result is paralysis .     still , for the center , it was a time of celebration .     \u201cthe citizens of israel today said no to politics of fear and hatred , \u201d mr. lapid told an upscale crowd of supporters who had welcomed him with drums , dancing and popping champagne corks . \u201cthey said no to the possibility that we might splinter off into sectors , and groups and tribes and narrow interest groups . they said no to extremists , and they said no to antidemocratic behavior. \u201d     with 99 percent of the ballots counted by wednesday morning , the traditional blocs were evenly divided , with 60 parliament seats for right-wing and religious parties , and 60 for center , left and arab-dominated factions .     mr. netanyahu \u2019 s likud-beiteinu ticket had 31 seats , followed by 19 for mr. lapid \u2019 s yesh atid and 15 for labor . the ultra-orthodox shas party and the jewish home , which is dominated by religious-zionists and advocates annexing the west bank , each garnered 11 seats . tzipi livni \u2019 s hatnua and the left-wing , pro-peace meretz each got six , while the three arab parties totaled 12. kadima which won the most parliament seats \u2013 28 \u2013 in the last election , had 2 , having collapsed after briefly joining the netanyahu coalition last year but failing to fulfill its promises . votes of soldiers and a few other groups had yet to be counted and could change the balance .     the prime minister called mr. lapid shortly after the polls closed at 10 p.m. tuesday and , according to israeli television reports , told him that they had great things to do together for the country . in his speech to a rowdy crowd of supporters here wednesday morning , he said , \u201ci see many partners. \u201d     mr. lapid indicated he was open to working with mr. netanyahu , saying the only way to face israel \u2019 s challenges was \u201ctogether. \u201d but he added : \u201cwhat is good for israel is not in the possession of the right , and nor is it in the possession of the left . it lies in the possibility of creating here a real and decent center. \u201d\n"}, {"url": "file://test/63/2/1", "title": "test/63/2/1", "content": "carrie fisher will appear from beyond the grave in the upcoming
