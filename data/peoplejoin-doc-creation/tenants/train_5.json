"washington ( reuters ) - the obama administration formally notified congress on wednesday of a $ 1.83-billion arms sale package for taiwan , including two frigates , anti-tank missiles , amphibious assault vehicles and other equipment , drawing an angry response from china .     aav-p7a1 amphibious assault vehicles of the taiwan marine corps are seen as part of a parade during taiwan ' s national day celebrations in front of the presidential office in taipei october 10 , 2011. reuters/pichi chuang     the authorization , which reuters on monday reported was imminent , came a year after congress passed legislation approving the sale . it is the first such major arms sale to taiwan in more than four years .     the white house said there was no change in the longstanding u.s. \u201cone china \u201d policy . past u.s. weapons sales to taiwan have attracted strong condemnation in china , which considers taiwan a renegade province .     the white house said the authorization followed previous sales notifications by the administration totaling more than $ 12 billion under the taiwan relations act .     \u201cour longstanding policy on arms sales to taiwan has been consistent across six different u.s. administrations , \u201d a national security council spokesman , myles caggins , said . \u201cwe remain committed to our one-china policy , \u201d he added .     although washington does not recognize taiwan as a separate state from china , it is committed under the taiwan relations act to ensuring taipei can maintain a credible defense .     the sales come at a period of heightened tension between the united states and china over the south china sea , where washington has been critical of china \u2019 s building of man-made islands to assert expansive territorial claims .     china summoned the u.s. charge d \u2019 affaires in beijing , kaye lee , to protest and said it would impose sanctions on the companies involved , state news agency xinhua reported .     \u201ctaiwan is an inalienable part of china \u2019 s territory . china strongly opposes the u.s. arms sale to taiwan , \u201d xinhua quoted vice foreign minister zheng zeguang , who summoned lee , as saying .     zheng said the sales went against international law and basic norms of international relations and \u201cseverely \u201d harmed china \u2019 s sovereignty and security .     \u201cto safeguard our national interests , china has decided to take necessary measures , including imposing sanctions against the companies involved in the arms sale , \u201d zheng said .     the u.s. state department said raytheon ( rtn.n ) and lockheed martin ( lmt.n ) were the main contractors in the sales .     related coverage china says no cooperation with u.s. firms selling taiwan arms     it was not clear what impact sanctions might have on the companies , although in 2013 , lockheed martin signed a pact with the thailand-based reignwood group to build an offshore plant to supply energy for a luxury resort on hainan island in southern china .     \u201cu.s . companies participating in arms sales to taiwan gravely harm china \u2019 s sovereignty and security interests , \u201d foreign ministry spokesman hong lei said .     \u201cchina \u2019 s government and companies will not carry out cooperation and commercial dealings with these types of companies. \u201d     however , previous chinese sanction threats have not been followed up by beijing .     china \u2019 s defense ministry said the sale would also inevitably affect military-to-military ties , but did not elaborate .     taiwan \u2019 s defense ministry said the new weapons would be phased in over a number of years and would enable taiwan to maintain and develop a credible defense .     u.s. state department spokesman john kirby said the decision was based solely on taiwan \u2019 s defense needs .     \u201cthe chinese can react to this as they see fit , \u201d he said . \u201cthis is nothing new . ... there \u2019 s no need for it to have any derogatory effect on our relationship with china. \u201d     kirby said washington wanted to work to establish a \u201cbetter , more transparent more effective relationship \u201d with china in the region and had been in contact with both taiwan and china on this on wednesday . he declined to elaborate .     david mckeeby , another state department spokesman , said the arms package included two perry-class guided-missile frigates ; $ 57 million of javelin anti-tank missiles made by raytheon and lockheed martin ; $ 268 million of tow 2b anti-tank missiles and $ 217 million of stinger surface-to-air missiles made by raytheon , and $ 375 million of aav-7 amphibious assault vehicles .     the state department said the frigates were being offered as surplus items at a cost of $ 190 million . the package also includes $ 416 million of guns , upgrade kits , ammunition and support for raytheon \u2019 s close-in weapons system .     analysts and congressional sources believe the delay in the formal approval of the sales was due to the obama administration \u2019 s desire to maintain stable working relations with china , an increasingly powerful strategic rival but also a vital economic partner as the world \u2019 s second-largest economy .     u.s. republican lawmakers said on wednesday they were pleased the administration had authorized the sale but called for a more regular process for such transactions .     john mccain , chairman of the senate armed services committee , said this would \u201cavoid extended periods in which fear of upsetting the u.s.-china relationship may harm taiwan \u2019 s defense capabilities. \u201d\n"}, {"url": "file://train/5/1/1", "title": "train/5/1/1", "content": "centennial \u2014 prosecutors in the aurora theater shooting case say they are \" extremely unlikely \" to accept an offer from suspect james holmes to plead guilty unless they hear more details from him .     in a court filing thursday , prosecutors write that after holmes offered to plead guilty , they asked him and his attorneys to provide \" specific access to information that would allow them to fully assess the defendant and his alleged acts for purposes of determining a just outcome to this case . \" they say holmes and his attorneys have repeatedly denied access to that information .     because of that , prosecutors say holmes ' offer \u2014 which his attorneys disclosed in a court filing wednesday \u2014 is not acceptable .     \" there is not \u2014 and has never been \u2014 an actual or unqualified ' offer ' to plead guilty , \" they write in the thursday filing .     significantly , the prosecution ' s filing was signed by 18th judicial district attorney george brauchler and not one of the deputy district attorneys more directly involved in the case .     in the wednesday court filing , holmes ' attorneys said holmes has offered to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence in prison without parole . his attorneys wrote that the only thing preventing the case from concluding as early as monday \u2014 the date of the next scheduled hearing \u2014 is if prosecutors decide to press ahead seeking the death penalty .     advertisement     \" mr. holmes is currently willing to resolve the case to bring the proceedings to a speedy and definite conclusion for all involved , \" holmes ' lawyers wrote in their motion .     holmes ' attorneys wrote that they would likely file numerous pretrial motions if the case goes forward and that they may present a mental-health defense at trial .     in the lengthy response filed thursday , brauchler angrily denied holmes ' characterization of the plea offer and suggested that holmes ' attorneys are not acting in good faith by disclosing the offer in a public court filing . brauchler called the defense filing \" unusual and unprecedented \" in revealing plea negotiations to the judge and suggested wednesday ' s motion was a publicity ploy that violates the case ' s gag order . holmes ' lawyers had \" no legitimate reason \" to disclose the offer in court papers , brauchler wrote .     brauchler also disputed arguments by holmes ' lawyers that the case would require many months of hearings before even getting to trial . and brauchler took issue with apparent comments made by the head of the state public defender ' s office that were paraphrased in an associated press article wednesday . that , too , he said , violated the gag order .     \" the misrepresentation \u2014 now published by media outlets throughout the world \u2014 appears to be an attempt to deliberately prejudice the public , witnesses and victims against the people , \" brauchler wrote in his filing . \" the people believe that this needs to be corrected . \"     in recompense , prosecutors are asking that the judge deny a separate defense motion for sanctions against the prosecution \u2014 one that alleges law enforcement officials broke the gag order and leaked information to fox news . that motion has dragged in the fox news reporter who wrote the story , and she has been subpoenaed to turn over her notes and testify during monday ' s hearing about her sources .     the fox news reporter , jana winter , has fought the subpoena , and the prosecution ' s request on thursday has offered her an unexpected lifeline .     the two court filings this week forecast a dramatic showdown during monday morning ' s hearing , when brauchler said he will announce if he will seek the death penalty against holmes .     the revelation of holmes ' plea offer \u2014 and brauchler ' s furious response to that revelation \u2014 adds new complications to the death-penalty decision . brauchler and his staff have been talking with victims of the theater shooting to gauge their feelings about pursuing execution for holmes . victims have expressed mixed feelings .     holmes is charged with killing 12 people and injuring 58 others with gunfire during the july 20 attacks at the century aurora 16 movie theater .     john ingold : jingold@denverpost.com , 303-954-1068 or twitter.com/john_ingold\n"}], "hannah":

on monday morning after the psychiatrist , who is also a professor at the school , reported receiving a package believed to be from the suspect . although that package turned out to be from someone else and harmless , a search of the campus services ' mailroom turned up another package sent to the psychiatrist with holmes \u2019 name in the return address , the source told foxnews.com .     a second law enforcement source said authorities got a warrant from a county judge and took the package away monday night . when it was opened , its chilling contents were revealed .     the first source on tuesday told foxnews.com the package had been in the mailroom since july 12 , though another source who confirmed the discovery to foxnews.com could not say if the package arrived prior to friday ' s massacre . it was not clear why it had not been delivered to the psychiatrist .     the notebook is now in possession of the fbi , sources told foxnews.com .     the university of colorado

to foxnews.com \u2019 s request for comment prior to publication of this article , the same university spokeswoman , jacque montgomery , had said only that she was not aware of the contents of the package or who had sent it .     the university also denied wednesday that the package \" sat on a loading dock , \" though there was no mention of a loading dock in the original foxnews.com story .

the psychiatry outpatient facility , located in building 500 , where the first suspicious package was delivered . it could not be verified that the psychiatrist had had previous contact with holmes , who was a dropout from the school \u2019 s neuroscience doctoral program and had studied various mental health issues and ailments as part of his curriculum .     holmes is accused of killing 12 and

on the matter , citing a gag order issued monday by arapahoe county district judge william sylvester . arapahoe county district attorney carol chambers ' office and aurora police also could not comment due to the gag order .     police believe the july 20 attack was meticulously planned . holmes allegedly tossed tear gas canisters into the crowded theater , and then fired his 12-gauge shotgun at the ceiling before turning it on the crowd . as panicked movie watchers raced for the exits , he switched to a .40 glock pistol and a .223 smith &amp; wesson m&p semi-automatic with a high-capacity drum clip , sources told fox news . the gun jammed , likely preventing far more deaths .     after the gun jammed , holmes allegedly walked out of the theater through the door he ' d entered and was removing his body armor beside his car when he was confronted by the officers who took him down , the source said , adding that the gunman seemed surprised authorities arrived so quickly .     before mounting the horrific attack , holmes allegedly booby-trapped his apartment and left music blasting , possibly to create a diversion that would occupy police and rescue personnel several miles away from the theater , the source said .     fox news has learned that the door was wired with a booby-trap and a backup system that would have triggered an explosive designed to \" cut in half \" the first person through the door . after that , explosions and flames would have likely consumed the entire building , presumably with the intention of trapping other residents as they slept and forcing a massive response of police and rescue personnel .     holmes , who made his first court appearance monday and looked disoriented and disheveled , could face the death penalty .

self-propelled howitzers during the annual han kuang exercises in hsinchu , north eastern taiwan . china on wednesday , dec .... ( associated press )     the arms package is the first offered by the u.s. to the self-governing island in four years . even before its announcement , beijing , which regards taiwan as part of its territory , demanded it be scrapped to avoid harming relations across the taiwan strait and between china and the u.s.     that was followed by a formal diplomatic protest late wednesday , although at a lower level than in previous such instances .     \" china resolutely opposes the sale of weapons to taiwan by the u.s. , \" vice foreign minister zheng zeguang said in a meeting with washington ' s second-highest ranking diplomat in beijing .     \" in order to safeguard the nation ' s interests , the chinese side has decided to take necessary measures , including the imposition of sanctions against companies participating in the arms sale to taiwan , \" zheng said , according to a statement posted on the ministry ' s website .     such sanctions have been threatened in the past , although there ' s no evidence they ' ve had any meaningful effect . american and european union companies are banned from selling military technology to china , and chinese companies have extensive links with major overseas firms that often have weapon-making divisions .     a u.s. embassy spokesman , speaking on routine condition of anonymity , declined to comment on the meeting , saying , \" we don ' t get into the content of our diplomatic discussions . \"     the u.s. maintained there ' s no need for it to hurt the relationship , which has also been strained by china ' s island-building in the south china sea and alleged cybertheft .     the administration notified congress that the proposed arms package includes two decommissioned u.s. navy frigates , anti-tank missiles , amphibious assault vehicles and stinger surface-to-air missiles . there ' s also support for taiwan ' s capabilities in intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance and a weapons system to defend against anti-ship missiles .     congress has 30 days to review the sale , but it ' s unlikely to raise objections . there ' s been mounting bipartisan concern that taiwan is inadequately armed to defend itself against an increasingly powerful mainland china .     u.s. lawmakers welcomed the announcement . there were calls from both parties for more frequent arms sales to taiwan .     new york rep. eliot engel , the top-ranking democrat on the house foreign affairs committee , said the sale would contribute to peace and stability across the strait . \" i wish we would see them on a regular basis , \" he said .     the committee ' s republican chairman , california rep. ed royce , said the administration had \" needlessly dragged out \" the approval process , and that other taiwanese requests \" have still not seen the light of day . \"     sen. john mccain , republican chairman of the senate armed services committee , said the u.s. should avoid extended periods during which \" fear of upsetting the u.s.-china relationship may harm taiwan ' s defense capabilities . \"     taiwan ' s foreign ministry cheered the announcement as a sign of healthy ties between taipei and washington and rejected claims it would harm relations with beijing .     the sale will \" help maintain peace and stability across the taiwan strait and increase our confidence as we engage in dialogue and improves relations across the taiwan strait , \" the ministry said in a statement .     \" it also highlights the fact that u.s.-taiwan relations are indeed at their best ever , \" the statement said .     however , a pro-taiwan business group in the u.s. lamented the amount of time taken to process the sale and questioned whether it was adequate in the face of china ' s rapid military advancements .     \" while china has deployed new fighters , submarines , and missiles during the last four years , the u.s. has consistently refused to consider providing taiwan access to similar platforms , or even aiding their indigenous development , \" rupert hammond-chambers , president of the u.s.-taiwan business council , said in a statement .     the administration has announced more than $ 12 billion in arms sales to taiwan since 2010 , but none since $ 5.9 billion in sales in september 2011 that included upgrades for taiwan ' s f-16 fighter jets . that drew a high-level diplomatic protest from beijing , which suspended some military exchanges with the united states . it did not seriously impair ties .     in the meantime , president barack obama has sought greater cooperation with china on issues such as climate change , and the two sides have increased military exchanges to reduce the risk of conflict .     state department spokesman john kirby said the u.s. was in contact with both taiwan and china about the sale , which he said was consistent with u.s. support for taiwan ' s ability to defend itself under the taiwan relations act .     \" there ' s no need for it to have any derogatory effect on our relationship with china , \" kirby told reporters . \" we still want to work to establish a better , more transparent , more effective relationship with china in the region and we ' re going to continue to work at that . \"     relations across the taiwan strait have undergone a steady improvement over the past two decades , especially under the china-friendly
