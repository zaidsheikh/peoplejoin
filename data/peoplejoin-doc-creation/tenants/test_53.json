instructed its provincial offices to survey the prices and supplies of black clothing in the market to ensure the public will not be taken advantage during the royal mourning period .     commerce minister apiradi tantraporn said demand for black garments had soared since the one-year mourning period began for his majesty king bhumibol , who passed away on thursday . as a result , her officials are closely monitoring the prices of mourning clothes as well as black and white fabric used for building decorations .     all traders have been asked to clearly label their prices and not to raise prices unreasonably or hoard goods . violators can face jail terms of up to seven years and/or fines of up to 140,000 baht .     she said the ministry would coordinate with distributors to ensure sufficient supplies of mourning garments across the country .     in bangkok , traders have been flocking to wholesale garment markets , especially in bo bae and pratunam , leading to traffic jams in

"test/53/2/0", "content": "many afghan army units are running out of key equipment , including humvees , because of their inability to do repairs or find replacements .     oct. 9 , 2013 many afghan army units are running out of key equipment , including humvees , because of their inability to do repairs or find replacements . javier manzano/for the washington post     after a tough fighting season , afghan soldiers are finding that a significant portion of their vital equipment is broken and cannot be easily replaced .     their fighting season nearly over , members of an embattled afghan army unit recently inspected their equipment , most of which was in two heaps on their base . there were humvees shredded by roadside bombs , armored trucks damaged by rocket-propelled grenades and other vehicles in need of repair after hard use in one of the country \u2019 s most volatile areas .     the afghan soldiers could not fix any of them , and replacements hadn \u2019 t come . seventy-five percent of the battalion \u2019 s armored vehicles were out of commission . there were so few humvees that some soldiers walked for 20 hours to get from base to base .     \u201chow can we fight a war like this ? \u201d asked col. hamidullah , the battalion commander , who like many afghans uses one name .     the problems plaguing hamidullah \u2019 s battalion represent what might be the biggest threat to the fledgling afghan army : an inability to repair or replace vital equipment once it is broken . the u.s. military shouldered that responsibility for years . but just as the afghan army started doing the bulk of the fighting , the americans stopped repairing afghan equipment .     the u.s. military said that turning over the job to the afghans was an inevitable part of the transition process . but with the afghan supply chain still undeveloped and the defense ministry still hobbled by corruption , army units across the country aren \u2019 t getting the gear and parts that they need .     afghan commanders are now taking stock of how many vehicles they have lost during the fighting season , which typically lasts from spring until fall , when many taliban commanders return to pakistan . nabiullah , a battalion commander in the arghandab river valley in southern kandahar province , said by telephone that 20 percent of his humvees have been blown up or have fallen into disrepair . khan agha , a battalion commander in kandahar \u2019 s panjwai district , said his unit lost about 15 percent of its humvees in the past four months .     \u201cwe don \u2019 t have enough trained professionals to take care of this equipment , \u201d nabiullah said .     by nearly all measures , it was a brutal fighting season for the afghan security forces . about 400 soldiers and police officers were killed every month . even in districts where there wasn \u2019 t much combat , improvised explosive devices , or roadside bombs , took an enormous toll on the army and its equipment . u.s. officials have praised the afghans for their resilience in the face of such heavy losses .     afghan soldiers say that they haven \u2019 t lost their willingness to fight but that the lack of functional equipment has restricted their ability to conduct operations . in hamidullah \u2019 s battalion , for example , the team charged with locating and disarming roadside bombs is down from four humvees to one , seriously reducing the number of patrols it can conduct .     even the much-lauded afghan special forces teams are plagued by the logistical problems .     \u201cthe americans gave us the humvees , but they didn \u2019 t give us the spare parts , \u201d said sgt . mohammad safi , who is part of the special forces team based in wardak province \u2019 s nerkh district . his team lost three humvees this fighting season , and none have been replaced .     lack of spare parts     it \u2019 s hard to overstate the importance of the armored vehicles to afghan troops . this month , the taliban fired two rocket-propelled grenades at a personnel carrier from hamidullah \u2019 s battalion while the soldiers were on a routine patrol . the windshield was shattered , the roof was mangled and the engine was damaged , but the men inside were unharmed .     days later , three afghan mechanics were hard at work trying to repair the damaged engine . the americans had left them a manual to fix the vehicle , full of diagrams and pictures of spare parts . but the afghans had received few of those parts . they were even out of engine oil .     it didn \u2019 t take long for the mechanics to realize that they couldn \u2019 t get the vehicle running again .     \u201cof course it feels bad when i can \u2019 t fix something \u2014 but i know i could if i had the spare parts , \u201d said one of the mechanics , pvt . sardar mohammad .     to get them , the soldiers would have to fill and send a series of forms to the defense ministry \u2014 and wait . some battalions have waited three years to get key parts or to have their humvees replaced , because of bureaucratic inefficiency . it \u2019 s much easier to replace the army \u2019 s ford rangers , but because those trucks aren \u2019 t armored , they are not as desirable , especially in violent eastern afghanistan . if the soldiers had been in a ranger when the rpgs struck , they probably would have been seriously injured or killed .     \u201cwhen we go on operations , either 10 guys cram into one humvee , or we walk , \u201d pvt . rahmatullah said . \u201ca ranger is made of paper. \u201d     the afghan defense ministry has acknowledged nagging problems with the army \u2019 s ability to repair and replace valuable equipment , despite a massive u.s. investment in afghan forces . earlier this year , gen. mohammad zahir azimi , a spokesman for the ministry , cited that weakness as a reason why continued russian financial assistance was so important .     procurement troubles     the logistical hurdles go beyond getting new vehicles or spare parts . a procurement debacle at the defense ministry has prevented tens of thousands of soldiers from getting army-     issued boots . instead , they have to buy shoes themselves , sometimes wearing tattered running sneakers . hamidullah \u2019 s unit has also run out of rockets that can be used with the launchers it was provided .     still , hamidullah considers himself lucky . because his unit is only 70 miles from kabul , the capital , he typically gets the fuel he needs . for units far from headquarters , their allotted fuel shipment never arrives in full . both afghan soldiers and u.s. officials suspect that some of it is stolen .     the fighting is expected to die down in the coming weeks . afghan commanders want to know : will their gear be fixed before spring comes and the violence picks up once again ? another tough fighting season could wipe out what \u2019 s left of hamidullah \u2019 s vehicles .     u.s. officials say that they are aware of the afghan security forces \u2019 logistical problems but that they have seen signs of improvement .     \u201cthe fighting season raises the stakes and exacerbates the problems of any military , \u201d u.s. brig . gen. eric wesley said . \u201cwe recognize the problem and so do they , but we think we \u2019 re on our way to a solution. \u201d     that solution would involve nato forces helping the afghans improve the supply chain that connects far-flung bases to the defense ministry in kabul and ensuring that afghan mechanics have the skills and tools to fix their equipment .     this week , maj. gen. dean milner of the nato training mission in afghanistan announced that the alliance would redouble efforts to improve supply processes and prevent waste and fraud in the afghan defense ministry .     but the push comes as the americans are rapidly withdrawing from afghanistan , removing advisers working with afghan battalions and attaching them to higher levels of leadership . at those more-senior levels , officials say , these advisers will be able to identify and monitor systemic problems . but they are less likely to assist when a battalion or platoon is handicapped by an isolated logistical issue , particularly compared with a few years ago , when the americans were fixing afghan vehicles themselves .     hamidullah \u2019 s battalion recently launched its last significant operation of the fighting season . soldiers piled into the remaining humvees . others reluctantly took rangers . the mechanics stayed behind , tinkering with the broken vehicle they knew they couldn \u2019 t fix .     \u201ci \u2019 ll send it to brigade , \u201d said sardar mohammad , the mechanic . \u201cbut i already know they don \u2019 t have the capacity to fix it. \u201d\n"}], "hannah": [], "eden": []}, "user_id_to_descriptions": {"alice": "Is interested in compiling a summary.", "cassie": "Knows about
