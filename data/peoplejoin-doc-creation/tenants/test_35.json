perhaps the most decorated elementary-school teacher in the country , the only k-12 educator ever to receive the national medal of the arts \u2014 has been accused of sexual misconduct in shocking documents released tuesday by los angeles unified school district .     until he was removed from the classroom this spring , esquith , 61 , had taught fifth grade at hobart elementary school , a high-poverty school in los angeles with an overwhelming percentage of english-language learners , for more than 30 years . esquith \u2019 s \u201chobart shakespeareans \u201d nonprofit , which puts on a shakespeare production every year in his classroom , became world-renowned , the subject of a pbs documentary , and a resplendent example of the miracles that committed public educators can work even in challenging school environments . when he wasn \u2019 t transforming young lives , esquith was writing inspirational books and accepting lots of awards : in addition to the national medal of the arts , his prizes include oprah winfrey \u2019 s use your life award , disney \u2019 s national outstanding teacher of the year award , and even dalai lama \u2019 s compassion in action award .     advertisement         and now for the it-was-all-too-good-to-be-true part : according to the los angeles times , this spring , one teacher reported that esquith had made an inappropriate joke about mark twain \u2019 s the adventures of huckleberry finn , saying that if he couldn \u2019 t raise enough cash to fund the annual production , the class would have to perform naked . then there was :     an incident from march 2015 in which esquith told a student who had completed his work that he could \u201csurf the net for porn . that \u2019 s what we do in our spare time. \u201d \u2026 esquith told a student who would appear in an upcoming play that \u201cif the audience doesn \u2019 t like his performance , he can perform while nude , or at least wear a fig leaf . and , from what i \u2019 ve heard , it would be a small fig leaf. \u201d     these claims kicked off los angeles unified \u2019 s investigation into esquith , who was removed from the classroom pending its findings . in october , he was fired , a move greeted with outrage all over the country . in the washington post , education columnist jay mathews , who had named esquith \u201camerica \u2019 s best classroom teacher \u201d in 2007 , wrote that : *     he has been dismissed for murky reasons that appear to be part of a witch hunt against hundreds of other l.a. educators \u2026 the result of l.a. school leaders losing touch with reality after being traumatized by a molestation scandal a few years ago .     advertisement         but now , with the 66-page document dump , those reasons no longer seem so murky .     while esquith has not been charged with a crime ( though the documents do allege that , even before he became a teacher , esquith fondled several children in the 1970s ) , he comes across as a desperate , preening , pathetic predator : the last person you want near your kids . he \u2019 s accused of spanking , fondling , and tickling female students ; making grossly inappropriate comments ( saying , for example , that one student \u201cloved green m&m \u2019 s because they made her horny \u201d ) ; and screening movies with sexually inappropriate content to fifth-graders after school .     and then there were the emails . lots and lots of legitimately grotesque emails , addressed to students who were at most 14 years old , that lay bare the consummate creepiness : he addressed one student as \u201csupermodel \u201d and signed off to another as \u201cyour favorite atm. \u201d the wednesday washington post story about the allegations uses one of his lines as its headline : \u201chow is my favorite hottie ? \u201d and this , from the los angeles times :     in one 2013 email , esquith praised a former student , who was 14 years old , saying she was \u201cbeautiful . elegant . dazzling . sexy . gorgeous. \u201d and in the same conversation writes \u201cdon \u2019 t argue , hottie. \u201d he later writes to her , \u201cyou \u2019 re soooooooooooooooo fine. \u201d     the conversations include one in which the girl thanks him for giving her lunch money and \u201cfor the hundreds and hundreds \u201d he \u2019 s given her .     captain inappropriate wrote another girl , \u201cyou will do well wherever you go because you \u2019 re great , but i want you to be happy and have lots of guys and beer and drugs and all the things that make high school great ! \u201d     before the documents became public , esquith \u2019 s lawyer accused the school district of constructing a \u201cfraudulent narrative \u201d as part of its \u201clatest effort to smear. \u201d in october , esquith filed a $ 1 billion class-action lawsuit on behalf of approximately 2,000 lausd teachers who were removed from the classroom for no clear reason \u2014 part of an age-discrimination scheme , the suit alleged , to place pressure on teachers approaching retirement age to resign without the full pension and benefits they \u2019 d earned . we \u2019 ll see how that one works out .\n"}, {"url": "file://test/35/1/3", "title": "test/35/1/3", "content": "the chipotle at 9733 sawmill parkway in powell was closed monday following multiple
