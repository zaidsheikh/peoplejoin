( associated press )     vatican city ( ap ) \u2014 a 2006 letter from a top vatican official confirms that the holy see received information in 2000 about the sexual misconduct of now-resigned u.s. cardinal , lending credibility to bombshell accusations of a cover-up at the highest echelons of the roman catholic church .     catholic news service , the news agency of the u.s. bishops ' conference , published the letter friday from then-archbishop leonardo sandri to the rev . boniface ramsay , a new york priest who made the initial allegation .     ramsay informed the vatican in a november 2000 letter about then cardinal theodore mccarrick ' s misconduct with seminarians from seton hall university ' s immaculate conception seminary . ramsay , who in 2000 was on the faculty at the seminary , has said he sent the letter at the request of the then-vatican ambassador because he had heard so many complaints from seminarians that mccarrick would invite them to his beach house and into his bed .     sandri , now a top-ranked vatican cardinal who was the no . 3 in the vatican ' s secretariat of state at the time , wrote ramsay on oct. 11 , 2006 , seeking his recommendation for a former seminarian for a vatican job .     in it , he referred to ramsay ' s 2000 letter , saying : \" i ask with particular reference to the serious matters involving some of the students of the immaculate conception seminary , which in november 2000 you were good enough to bring confidentially to the attention of the then-apostolic nuncio in the united states , the late archbishop gabriel montalvo . \"     archbishop carlo maria vigano , at the center of a storm rocking pope francis ' papacy , cited ramsay ' s 2000 letter in his own expose of a cover-up about the mccarrick affair . he named sandri among a long list of vatican officials who knew about mccarrick ' s penchant for seminarians . vigano also accused francis of knowing in 2013 of mccarrick ' s misconduct but of rehabilitating him from sanctions purportedly imposed by pope benedict xvi .     sandri ' s letter is significant because it corroborates ramsay ' s story as well as vigano ' s claims . it shows the vatican knew about allegations against mccarrick in 2000 , a year before st. john paul ii made him a cardinal . and it further implicates the benedict ' s papacy for failing to take action against mccarrick for years even as more allegations against him arrived .     vigano says benedict eventually imposed some form of sanction on mccarrick in 2009 or 2010 , nearly a decade after ramsay ' s letter arrived . the fact that sandri cited it so readily suggests it wasn ' t lost in a pile of unread mail somewhere , but was relevant even for a simple job reference .     significantly , sandri appeared more concerned about the sexual purity of the seminarian-candidate than that mccarrick might have sexually abused or harassed him , or abused his power over him .     mccarrick resigned as a cardinal in july after a u.s. church investigation determined an accusation that he groped a teen-age altar boy in the 1970s was credible . since then several seminarians have come forward to say he routinely bedded them , or harassed them when they refused .     his lawyer has said the accusations are serious and that mccarrick looks forward to invoking his right to due process at the right time .\n"}, {"url": "file://test/50/2/2", "title": "test/50/2/2", "content": "a maryland high school will reopen friday , even as police continue to search for suspects responsible for a shooting that left two teens injured . mark segraves reports .
