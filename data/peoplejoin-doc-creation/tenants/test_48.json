hotel maid in a scandal that appeared to wreck his hopes of becoming france ' s next president .     the sexual assault charges throw the imf into a leadership crisis just as it is trying to help ease an escalating euro zone debt crisis , and they turn france ' s presidential election campaign upside down when polls had made strauss-kahn a clear front runner .     the charismatic 62-year-old , who led the international monetary fund through the 2007-09 global financial meltdown and has been central in galvanizing europe to tackle its debt woes , for long had the reputation of a womanizer . but the charges he faces are in another realm .     a maid , 32 , said he emerged naked from the bathroom and sexually assaulted her inside his $ 3,000-a-night suite at the sofitel hotel in new york ' s times square on saturday afternoon . he was there on private business , the imf said .     strauss-kahn was expected to go before a state court later on sunday . his lawyer said he will plead not guilty .     police say he fled the hotel after the alleged assault and a few hours later they pulled him out of his first-class seat on an air france plane 10 minutes before it was to take off for paris .     he was charged with a criminal sexual act , unlawful imprisonment and attempted rape , moving him from luxurious hotel suite and a glittering public career to scandal and a bare holding cell in new york ' s tough harlem neighborhood in the space of a few hours .     the contrast could barely have been more dramatic . at the sofitel , strauss-kahn ' s suite had a conference room , living room , foyer , spacious marble bathroom and a bedroom with a sumptuous king-sized bed and feather and down duvet .     police say strauss-kahn does not have diplomatic immunity from the charges , which if proven could carry a prison sentence of 15-20 years . they have collected dna evidence from the hotel suite , the new york times reported .     strauss-kahn has hired new york lawyer benjamin brafman , a seasoned defense attorney famed for striking deals or winning not-guilty verdicts for pop stars and a football player .     the imf chief ' s wife , well-known french television personality anne sinclair , jumped to her husband ' s defense .     \" i do not believe for a single second the accusations leveled against my husband , \" she said in a statement ..     imf crisis , election ' thunderbolt '     the imf tried to fill its leadership vacuum by naming its no . 2 official , john lipsky , as acting managing director . but the charges against strauss-kahn are a huge embarrassment for an institution that oversees the global economic system and has authorized hundreds of billions of dollars of lending to troubled countries as well as playing a major role in the euro-zone debt crisis .     the allegations immediately threw france ' s presidential race wide open .     he had not yet declared his candidacy but strauss-kahn was widely expected to run for the socialist party and early opinion polls showed him with a big lead over the conservative incumbent , nicolas sarkozy , who is seeking a second term at the election next april .     \" the news we received from new york last night struck like a thunderbolt , \" said socialist leader martine aubry , appealing for party unity .     france ' s government as well as strauss-kahn ' s political allies and rivals called for caution and respect for the presumption of innocence , but his presidential ambitions appeared to be dead in the water unless the case against him quickly unravels and he is shown to be innocent .     \" all this is completely astounding , immensely troubling and distressing . if the facts prove true ... it ' s something degrading for all women . it ' s terrible for the image of france , \" said francois bayrou , a centrist opponent .     far-right leader marine le pen said her rival ' s presidential hopes had been crushed .     christine boutin , president of the christian democrat party , suggested strauss-kahn may have been set up .     \" i think it ' s very likely a trap was set for dominique strauss-kahn and he fell into it , \" she told france ' s bfm television . \" it ' s a political bomb for domestic politics . \"     french voters are famously tolerant of political leaders ' extra-marital affairs but the allegations against strauss-kahn are entirely different , and much more serious .     if they are proven , strauss-kahn ' s fall from power in a scandal would be one of the most dramatic of any high-profile international figure in decades .     many politicians have fallen after being caught in extra-marital affairs and others have survived them , including former presidents john f. kennedy and bill clinton as well as former french president francois mitterrand .     but rarely have senior figures faced brutal assault charges like those filed against strauss-kahn .     with strauss-kahn in the dock , the imf also now faces many questions of its own , because his character had been questioned before .     in 2008 , strauss-kahn apologized for \" an error of judgment \" after an affair with a female imf economist who was his subordinate .     the fund ' s board of member countries warned him against further improper conduct , but cleared him of harassment and abuse of power and kept him in his job . it will now face new scrutiny over whether that response was too weak , especially as there have been persistent rumors about strauss-kahn making sexual advances to women .     pivotal in europe ' s debt woes     an economics professor and former french finance minister , strauss-kahn took over the imf in november 2007 for a five-year term , and won praise for helping galvanize leaders to inject billions of dollars into the world economy during the global financial crisis .     he introduced sweeping changes to ensure vulnerable countries swamped by the crisis had access to emergency loans , and others to give major emerging market countries such as china , india and brazil greater voting powers in the imf .     witty , multi-lingual , a skilled public speaker and sharp back-room negotiator , strauss-kahn also weighed into thornier issues by urging china to let its currency rise in a dispute with the united states .     a crisis of leadership at the fund now will especially worry european nations given strauss-kahn ' s pivotal role in brokering bailouts for iceland , hungary , greece , ireland and portugal .     \" the chances are the successor won ' t be a european , and will want to rebalance the imf ' s priorities away from its massive commitment in europe , \" said jean pisani-ferry , director of the bruegel economic think-tank .     strauss-kahn had been due to meet german chancellor angela merkel on sunday and join euro zone finance ministers on monday to discuss the bloc ' s debt crisis and how to handle greece , which is struggling to meet the terms of a 110 billion euro european union/imf bailout last year .     \" this might definitely cause some delays in the short term , \" a greek official told reuters on condition of anonymity .     strauss-kahn ' s lawyers moved quickly to cast doubts on the allegations against him .     \" we must wait until things settle and see if it ' s true or a provocation , \" said one of his france-based lawyers , leon lef forster . \" we must be especially careful not to get into a media circus and we must wait until things are clear . \"     brafman , his u.s. lawyer , previously defended pop star michael jackson against child molestation charges as well as other celebrities in trouble .     the maid who accused strauss-kahn told police he attacked her when she went in to clean his suite .     \" she told detectives he came out of the bathroom naked , ran down a hallway to the foyer where she was , pulled her into a bedroom and began to sexually assault her , according to her account , \" new york police spokesman paul browne said .     \" she pulled away from him and he dragged her down a hallway into the bathroom where he engaged in a criminal sexual act , according to her account to detectives . he tried to lock her into the hotel room . \"     the woman , who has not been named , was treated in hospital for minor injuries , browne said . she has worked at the hotel for three years and the property ' s manager said on sunday she has been a \" completely satisfactory \" employee in her work and her behavior .     under new york state law , attempted rape and criminal sexual act both carry a potential sentence of 15-20 years . unlawful imprisonment carries a potential sentence of three to five years .\n"}], "eden": [{"url": "file://test/48/0/0", "title": "test/48/0/0",

"content": "washington ( cnn ) barack and michelle obama re-emerged on the public stage monday in washington , only this time for an event that has nothing to do with politics .     the former first couple ' s official portraits were unveiled at the smithsonian ' s national portrait gallery , a rite of passage for most former presidents , all of whom have their portraits hanging in the museum .     these are perhaps the most anticipated presidential portrait unveilings to date , due in large part to the artists the obamas selected . the former president chose kehinde wiley , a yale university-trained painter famous for his depiction of african-americans posed in the style of old master paintings , regal , formal and filled with pops of color .     barack obama ' s portrait     \" how about that ? that ' s pretty sharp , \" the 44th president said as he took the podium . the portrait depicts him sitting against a backdrop of green foliage . obama said he tried to negotiate with wiley about his look for the painting .     \" i tried to negotiate less gray hair , and kehinde ' s artistic integrity would not allow him to do what i asked . i tried to negotiate smaller ears , struck out on that as well , \" joked obama from the podium during his remarks .     obama also asked wiley , who often depicts his subjects as regal and god-like , if the could ease up on those flourishes .     \" i had to explain that i ' ve got enough political problems without you making me look like napoleon . we ' ve got to bring it down just a touch . and that ' s what he did , \" the former president said .     barack obama ' s choice of wiley makes him the first african-american artist to execute an official presidential portrait for the national portrait gallery .     \" what i was always struck by when i saw his portraits was the degree to which they challenged our ideas of power and privilege , \" obama said .     the juxtaposition of contemporary urban culture with centuries-old postures and wallpaper-like backgrounds make for bold paintings , of which obama ' s is wiley ' s most famous to date .     wiley apparently took thousands of photographs of obama in order to create the portrait , a process different than the typical \" sittings \" required for most portraits .     wiley ' s background choice was also indicative of obama ' s background . wiley said he was \" charting his path on earth . \"     the different flowers woven into the greenery include the chyrsanthemum , the official flower of chicago , and jasmine for hawaii , there ' s even some african blue lilies , symbolic of obama ' s heritage .     obama also pointed out his personal connection to wiley -- both men shared similar familial experiences that shaped their futures .     \" what we did find was that we had certain things in common . both of us had american mothers who raised us with extraordinary love and support . both of us had african fathers who had been absent from our lives , and in some ways our journeys involved searching for them , and what that meant . i ended up writing about that journey and channeling it into the work that i did because i cannot paint , \" he said .     michelle obama ' s portrait     michelle obama said she \" was a little overwhelmed , to say the least , \" after her portrait was unveiled . \" let ' s just start by saying , ' wow , ' again , \" she said . pointing to her mother , seated in the audience , she added : \" hi mom . whatcha ' think ? pretty nice , isn ' t it ? \"     for her portrait , michelle obama chose baltimore-based artist amy sherald . sherald is another african-american artist known for her unique style , and her portraits also tend to underscore themes of social justice . she often paints black skin tones in gray as a way to take away the assigned \" color \" of her subjects . sherald ' s work is less about realism in composition and more about shape and color ; like wiley , the choice of sherald ushers in a new era of presidential portrait .     \" amy , i want to thank you for so spectacularly capturing the grace and beauty and intelligence and charm and hotness of the woman i love , \" the former president said of his wife .     sherald ' s painting of michelle obama shows her in a flowing , patterned dress with a halter neckline ; her expression is thoughtful , her chin resting on her hand .     the former first lady said she was thinking about the impact sherald ' s work will have on \" girls and girls of color . \"     \" they will see an image of someone who looks like them hanging on the walls of this great american institution ... and i know the kind of impact that will have on their lives because i was one of those girls , \" she said .     the obamas looked at the portfolios of more than two dozen artists before deciding on wiley and sherald . obama ' s portrait will hang in the hall of presidents and the former first lady ' s will be placed in another gallery . both will be open to public viewing on tuesday .\n"}], "hannah": [{"url": "file://test/48/1/1", "title": "test/48/1/1", "content": "richard carpenter , representing the singer-songwriting

that the defendants rejected the claim of royalties . he is seeking compensatory damages of at least $ 2 million .     among other things , according to the lawsuit , the record labels \u201cimproperly classified \u201d revenue from digital downloads of carpenters \u2019 music as sales of records as opposed to licensing revenue \u2014 short-changing them from a higher royalty rate .

litigation involving the recordings of eminem in which the defendants were several affiliates of umg . ultimately , the 9th circuit court of appeals ruled that digital downloads were a licensing of
