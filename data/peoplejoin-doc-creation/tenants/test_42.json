\u201d     stockman went on : \u201cthe democrats are not doing anything about their guy either . they should be pounding the table \u2014 why aren \u2019 t we cutting the defense budget by $ 100 billion a year instead of this embarrassing pinprick [ $ 78 billion over five years ] that [ defense secretary robert ] gates has come up with ? it \u2019 s unfortunate , but when you bury yourself in $ 52 trillion of debt \u2014 public , private , business , housing and government \u2014 you can \u2019 t make it go away . because all the people who loaned you that money think they have a contract with you to pay it back . so we \u2019 re going to go through a massive workout , and during that process i don \u2019 t think the economy \u2019 s going to grow \u2014 it \u2019 s going to struggle and suffer . those are the facts that washington is unwilling to face. \u201d     stockman \u2014 who in 1981 wrote the guidelines for a government shutdown that , three decades later , are still the template for the action he favors \u2014 insisted that the economic consequences of temporarily laying off one-fourth of the country \u2019 s 4 million federal employees and closing the doors of various agencies , have been greatly exaggerated in the service of demagoguery .     \u201ci think that \u2019 s a lot of baloney that \u2019 s being put out by the interest groups and lobbies and the white house , \u201d stockman told me , reacting to the democrats \u2019 dire claims of a new recession . \u201ca few days or even a few weeks of a very few people on furlough \u2014 most of whom are likely to get back pay , because that has been the precedent in the past \u2014 once this crisis is over , how is that going to affect a $ 15 trillion economy ?

zero ! none ! nothing ! ryan is taking a nice philosophical stand for the by and by \u2014 i call it the fiscal afterlife . but it \u2019 s not relevant to the wolf that \u2019 s at the door right now , and it \u2019 s going to exact huge amounts of political cost and baggage for no gain at all on the fiscal front. \u201d     also galling to stockman : \u201cthe republicans have come with a plan to reduce the deficit that involves cutting taxes by $ 4.2 trillion over the next 10 years . this is the ryan plan : burying us that much deeper because of this republican catechism about tax cuts , anytime , anywhere , for any reason. \u201d stockman said letting the current tax cuts expire , as called for in the next few years , will eventually produce $ 600 billion in deficit reduction . \u201cthe republicans should just sit on their hands and let it happen. \u201d     meanwhile , stockman told me that the abnormally low interest rate on the $ 14 trillion national debt \u2014 currently near zero \u2014 is likely to rise to normal levels in coming years by at least 300 basis points , or 3 percent . \u201cthis morning the european central bank started that process by raising interest rates \u2014 a little more enlightened than the fed . it \u2019 s kind of ironic \u2014 an increase of 300 basis points , a few quarters or years down the road , increases federal spending by half a trillion dollars . all of the assembled congressmen of every stripe and viewpoint \u2014 from tea party to left-liberal \u2014 could not come up with $ 500 billion in cuts between them. \u201d     as a former congressman , stockman acknowledged that the prospect of a shutdown isn \u2019 t without peril for the house republicans . after all , even right-wing firebrand michele bachmann , the de facto leader of the tea party in the house , is on record supporting efforts to avoid this severe outcome .     \u201cmaybe the public doesn \u2019 t like this , \u201d stockman said . \u201cyou have this fight going on between the 83 youngsters , the tea party newbies , and the boehner crowd that remembers 1995 well . if the public reacts badly to a shutdown , that will be a message to the republicans that you are totally out to lunch , thinking you can address a $ 1.6 trillion deficit , and spending 43 cents on every dollar for borrowing , without tax increases . because the public just shouted you down when you made the modest pinprick cut on your domestic spending , and to do that you shut down the government ?

the type which causes cold sores - and chlamydia bacteria are named as the major culprits , as well as a type of corkscrew-shaped bacteria called spirochaete .     \u201cthere is incontrovertible evidence that alzheimer \u2019 s disease has a dormant microbial component . we can \u2019 t keep ignoring all of the evidence \u201d     \u201cthere is incontrovertible evidence that alzheimer \u2019 s disease has a dormant microbial component . we can \u2019 t keep ignoring all of the evidence \u201d professor douglas kell , manchester university     currently most scientists are trying to find treatments which prevent the build of sticky amyloid plaques and misfolded tau proteins in the brain which prevent neurons from communicating with each other , leading to memory loss and cognitive decline .     but in an the editorial in the journal of alzheimer \u2019 s disease , it is suggested that it is a viral or bacterial infection which triggers the plaque build-up in the first place . targeting them specifically with antimicrobial drugs could halt dementia .     professor douglas kell of the university of manchester \u2019 s school of chemistry , said \u201cwe are saying there is incontrovertible evidence that alzheimer \u2019 s disease has a dormant microbial component . we can \u2019 t keep ignoring all of the evidence. \u201d     there are currently 850,000 people living with dementia in britain which is due to rise to one million by 2025 and two million by 2050. but despite 412 drugs trials taking place between 2002 and 2012 , nothing has been shown to combat the disease .     the authors say that viruses and bacteria are common in the brains of elderly people , and although they are usually dormant , they can \u2018wake up \u2019 after stress or if the immune system is compromised . around two thirds of people will acquire the herpes virus at some point in their lives , and many will not realise they have it .     photo : alamy     the herpes virus in particular is known to damage the central nervous system , and the limbic system in the brain which regulates mood and instinct and is associated with mental decline and personality changes .     they also point to the fact that a gene mutation - apoee4 - which makes one in five people more susceptible to alzheimer \u2019 s disease , also raises their susceptibility to infectious disease . viral infections in the brain are already known to cause symptoms similar to alzheimer \u2019 s and the experts say the link has been \u2018neglected \u2019 for too long .     \u201calzheimer \u2019 s disease causes great emotional and physical harm to sufferers and their carers as well as having enormously damaging economic consequences , \u201d they write .     \u201cwe write to express our concern that one particular aspect of the disease has been neglected , even though treatment based on it might slow or arrest alzheimer \u2019 s disease progression .     \u201cwe refer to the many studies , mainly on humans , implicating specific microbes in the elderly brain , notably herpes simplex virus type 1 , chlamydia pneumoniae and several types of spirochatete .     \u201cwe propose that further research on the role of infectious agents in alzheimer \u2019 s disease causation , including prospective trials of antimicrobial therapy , is now justified. \u201d     they say new findings could also have implications for the future treatment of parkinson \u2019 s disease , and other progressive neurological conditions .     professor resia pretorius of the university of pretoria , who worked with prof kell on the editorial , said \u201cthe microbial presence in blood may also play a fundamental role as causative agent of systemic inflammation , which is a characteristic of alzheimer \u2019 s disease .     \u201cfurthermore , there is ample evidence that this can cause neuroinflammation and plaque formation. \u201d     dementia charities said they had noticed that viruses and bacteria were more common in people with alzheimer ' s disease .     dr james pickett , head of research at alzheimer \u2019 s society said : \u201ca large number of different microbes including viruses , bacteria and fungi have been found in the brains of older people - but there do appear to be more of them in the brains of people who have died with alzheimer \u2019 s disease .     \" while these observations are interesting and warrant further research , there is currently insufficient evidence to tell us that microbes are responsible for causing alzheimer \u2019 s disease in the vast majority of cases . we would like to reassure people that there remains no convincing evidence that alzheimer \u2019 s disease is contagious or can be passed from person to person like a virus .     \u201cgiven the enormous global impact of dementia , there is intense interest from the research community to understand all the potential contributing factors . we welcome research that explores all possible avenues and have committed \u00a3 100 million over the next decade to more fully understand the causes of dementia and to improve diagnosis , treatment and prevention of the condition. \u201d     last year , researchers found that the ' seeds ' of alzheimer ' s could be passed through blood transfusions and medical accidents .     prof john hardy , professor of neuroscience , ucl , said : \u201cthis is a minority view in alzheimer research . there had been no convincing proof of infections causing alzheimer disease . we need always to keep an open mind but this editorial does not reflect what most researchers think about alzheimer disease. \u201d     dr simon ridley , director of research at alzheimer \u2019 s research uk , said : \u201cthere is growing evidence for the role of the immune system in alzheimer \u2019 s and active ongoing research looking at how an inflammatory response might contribute to the disease . there is some evidence to suggest that infections in general could ramp up the immune system and contribute to the progression of alzheimer \u2019 s , but there isn \u2019 t conclusive evidence to suggest that a particular infectious agent or microbe could be directly responsible for causing the disease .     \" there are many avenues being explored to understand the initial events that trigger the development of alzheimer \u2019 s and this is an important part of the research process for ruling in and out particular hypotheses . there is no evidence that alzheimer \u2019 s can be passed from person to person like a virus . continued research funding into diseases like alzheimer \u2019 s is important to build a clearer picture of the genetic and lifestyle risk factors for the disease and use this knowledge to develop preventions or treatments. \u201d\n"}, {"url": "file://test/42/2/2", "title": "test/42/2/2", "content": "we are researchers and clinicians working on alzheimer \u2019 s disease ( ad ) or related topics , and we write to express our concern that one particular aspect of the disease has been neglected , even though treatment based on it might slow or arrest ad progression . we refer to the many studies , mainly on humans , implicating specific microbes in the elderly brain , notably herpes simplex virus type 1 ( hsv1 ) , chlamydia pneumoniae , and several types of spirochaete , in the etiology of ad [ 1 \u2013 4 ] . fungal infection of ad brain [ 5 , 6 ] has also been described , as well as abnormal microbiota in ad patient blood [ 7 ] . the first observations of hsv1 in ad brain were reported almost three decades ago [ 8 ] . the ever-increasing number of these studies ( now about 100 on hsv1 alone ) warrants re-evaluation of the infection and ad concept .     ad is associated with neuronal loss and progressive synaptic dysfunction , accompanied by the deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 ( a\u03b2 ) peptide , a cleavage product of the amyloid-\u03b2 protein precursor ( a\u03b2pp ) , and abnormal forms of tau protein , markers that have been used as diagnostic criteria for the disease [ 9 , 10 ] . these constitute the hallmarks of ad , but whether they are causes of ad or consequences is unknown . we suggest that these are indicators of an infectious etiology . in the case of ad , it is often not realized that microbes can cause chronic as well as acute diseases ; that some microbes can remain latent in the body with the potential for reactivation , the effects of which might occur years after initial infection ; and that people can be infected but not necessarily affected , such that \u2018controls \u2019 , even if infected , are asymptomatic [ 2 ] .     evidence for an infectious/immune component ( i ) viruses and other microbes are present in the brain of most elderly people [ 11 \u2013 13 ] . although usually dormant , reactivation can occur after stress and immunosuppression ; for example , hsv1 dna is amplified in the brain of immunosuppressed patients [ 14 ] .     ( ii ) herpes simplex encephalitis ( hse ) produces damage in localized regions of the cns related to the limbic system , which are associated with memory , cognitive and affective processes [ 15 ] , as well as personality ( the same as those affected in ad ) .     ( iii ) in brain of ad patients , pathogen signatures ( e.g. , hsv1 dna ) specifically colocalize with ad pathology [ 13 , 16 , 17 ] .     ( iv ) hsv infection , as revealed by seropositivity , is significantly associated with development of ad [ 18 \u2013 21 ] .     ( v ) ad has long been known to have a prominent inflammatory component characteristic of infection ( reviewed in [ 22 , 23 ] ) .     ( vi ) polymorphisms in the apolipoprotein e gene , apoe , that modulate immune function and susceptibility to infectious disease [ 24 ] , also govern ad risk ( reviewed in [ 25 , 26 ] ) . genome-wide association studies reveal that other immune system components , including virus receptor genes , are further ad risk factors [ 27 \u2013 32 ] .     ( vii ) features of ad pathology are transmissible by inoculation of ad brain to primates [ 33 , 34 ] and mice [ 35 , 36 ] .     evidence for causation ( i ) in humans , brain infection ( e.g. , by hiv , herpesvirus , measles ) is known to be associated with ad-like pathology [ 37 \u2013 42 ] . historical evidence shows that the clinical and pathological hallmarks of ad occur also in syphilitic dementia , caused by a spirochaete [ 4 ] .     ( ii ) in mice and in cell culture , a\u03b2 deposition and tau abnormalities typical of ad are observed after infection with hsv1 [ 43 \u2013 52 ] or bacteria [ 16 , 53 \u2013 55 ] ; a direct interaction between a\u03b2pp and hsv1 has been reported [ 56 ] . antivirals , including acyclovir , in vitro block hsv1-induced a\u03b2 and tau pathology [ 57 ] .     ( iii ) olfactory dysfunction is an early symptom of ad [ 58 ] . the olfactory nerve , which leads to the lateral entorhinal cortex , the initial site from where characteristic ad pathology subsequently spreads through the brain [ 59 , 60 ] , is a likely portal of entry of hsv1 [ 61 ] and other viruses [ 62 ] , as well as chlamydia pneumoniae , into the brain [ 63 ] , implicating such agents in damage to this region . further , brainstem areas that harbor latent hsv directly irrigate these brain regions : brainstem virus reactivation would thus disrupt the same tissues as those affected in ad [ 64 ] .     growing evidence for mechanism : role of a\u03b2 ( i ) the gene encoding cholesterol 25-hydroxylase ( ch25h ) is selectively upregulated by virus infection , and its enzymatic product ( 25-hydroxycholesterol , 25ohc ) induces innate antiviral immunity [ 65 , 66 ] .     ( ii ) polymorphisms in human ch25 h govern both ad susceptibility and a\u03b2 deposition [ 67 ] , arguing that a\u03b2 induction is likely to be among the targets of 25ohc , providing a potential mechanistic link between infection and a\u03b2 production [ 68 ] .     ( iii ) a\u03b2 is an antimicrobial peptide with potent activity against multiple bacteria and yeast [ 69 ] . a\u03b2 also has antiviral activity [ 70 \u2013 72 ] .     ( iv ) another antimicrobial peptide ( \u03b2-defensin 1 ) is upregulated in ad brain [ 73 ] . regarding hsv1 , about 100 publications by many groups indicate directly or indirectly that this virus is a major factor in the disease . they include studies suggesting that the virus confers risk of the disease when present in brain of carriers of the \u025b4 allele of apoe [ 74 ] , an established susceptibility factor for ad ( apoe \u025b4 determines susceptibility in several disorders of infectious origin [ 75 ] , including herpes labialis , caused usually by hsv1 ) . the only opposing reports , two not detecting hsv1 dna in elderly brains and another not finding an hsv1 \u2013 apoe association , were published over a decade ago [ 76 \u2013 78 ] . however , despite all the supportive evidence , the topic is often dismissed as \u2018controversial \u2019 . one recalls the widespread opposition initially to data showing that viruses cause some types of cancer , and that a bacterium causes stomach ulcers . in summary , we propose that infectious agents , including hsv1 , chlamydia pneumonia , and spirochetes , reach the cns and remain there in latent form . these agents can undergo reactivation in the brain during aging , as the immune system declines , and during different types of stress ( which similarly reactivate hsv1 in the periphery ) . the consequent neuronal damage \u2014 caused by direct viral action and by virus-induced inflammation \u2014 occurs recurrently , leading to ( or acting as a cofactor for ) progressive synaptic dysfunction , neuronal loss , and ultimately ad . such damage includes the induction of a\u03b2 which , initially , appears to be only a defense mechanism . ad causes great emotional and physical harm to sufferers and their carers , as well as having enormously damaging economic consequences . given the failure of the 413 trials of other types of therapy for ad carried out in the period 2002 \u2013 2012 [ 79 ] , antiviral/antimicrobial treatment of ad patients , notably those who are apoe \u025b4 carriers , could rectify the \u2018no drug works \u2019 impasse . we propose that further research on the role of infectious agents in ad causation , including prospective trials of antimicrobial therapy , is now justified .\n"}], "hannah": []}, "user_id_to_descriptions": {"alice": "Is interested in compiling a summary.", "farshid": "Knows about the following topics:\ngovernment shutdown, David Stockman, Republicans\nDavid Stockman, government shutdown, budget negotiations, debt, economy\nIran, children's rights, international conventions, domestic legislation, Islamic Republic of Iran\nAlzheimer's disease, herpes, dementia, bacteria, infection\nAlzheimer's disease, herpes simplex virus, chlamydia pneumoniae, spirochaete, antiviral/antimicrobial treatment", "hannah": "Knows about the following topics:\n"}, "user_id_to_table_names": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_templated": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_lowprecision": {}, "user_id_to_descriptions_lowprecision_templated": {}}
