although his long-awaited fifth the lost symbol is published next month \u2013 brown did well to see off competition from john grisham , author of more than 20 and the second-most likely writer to be ditched in a charity shop by readers .     but as secondhand bookshop shelves flood with battered editions of angels and demons and digital fortress , brown can comfort himself with the fact that he ' s also oxfam ' s second most bought author : there are , apparently , still readers out there who have yet to follow the adventures of the dapper symbologist robert langdon . there ' s no such consolation for grisham , whose legal thrillers fail to make oxfam ' s bestseller charts at all .     \" there ' s no question that when you go into the back room of oxfam shops there are many dan

\u2019 s so important for the nation to keep its promises to military men and women , veterans , no matter where they served , have volunteered to put their lives on the line \u2014 and some make the ultimate sacrifice . those courageous enough to go into battle should face zero delays in getting the education benefits they \u2019 ve earned .     unfortunately , financial aid has been late or gone awol this fall for thousands of veterans and their families relying on the gi bill to get through school . the reason : a big information-technology glitch that surfaced with what seemed like a relatively minor change in how the aid is calculated .     while the u.s. department of veterans affairs ( va ) is trying to fix this , a lack of communication by the agency about the delays , coupled with inaction by the u.s. senate , has left service members-turned-students facing severe financial hardships . this week , the agency was still working to process more than 58,000 student aid claims .     on wednesday , the va announced that the information technology fixes will not be completed until december 2019 \u2014 more than a year past the original aug. 1 deadline for finishing this work . this is a national disgrace , one that should prompt congressional leadership to move quickly on short- and long-term solutions . a good start would be swift passage of a senate bill that would prohibit schools from penalizing student veterans for late va assistance payments . this would address a major concern that students with accounts in arrears due to delayed payments may not be allowed to enroll for 2019 coursework . given that the va has said the tech problems will continue until the end of 2019 , this protection is a sensible step .     the house merits praise for unanimously passing hold-students-harmless legislation , which has been dubbed the \u201csit-rep \u201d bill . but the legislation is bogged down in the senate .     \u201cif ever there was a time that it was obvious this bill needed to be passed , now is the time , \u201d said tanya ang , vice president of the veterans education success organization , in a statement provided for a nov. 15 house veterans affairs subcommittee hearing .     other testimony provided at the hearing made it clear that long-term solutions are urgently needed , too . the va has lacked a permanent chief information officer since january 2017 , which is unacceptable given how technology is so critical to delivering service members \u2019 benefits .     president donald trump nominated a well-qualified minnesota native , james gfrerer , last summer , but the senate has yet to confirm him . the senate is expected to take this up soon , but the delay is inexcusable .     both houses of congress also need to scrutinize a much larger problem \u2014 the antiquated it systems relied on by the va and other federal agencies . a statement provided to the house by booz allen hamilton , the private contractor originally hired to update the va system , makes clear the root of the gi bill problem : \u201cthe unfortunate delay has been caused by the confluence of outdated systems being asked to perform ever complex tasks. \u201d     a 2016 government accountability office report put the age of the va \u2019 s benefits delivery platform at more than a half century . at that time , other agencies , such as the treasury department , also had so-called \u201clegacy systems \u201d in that age range . \u201cmany use outdated software and hardware parts that are unsupported , \u201d the report warned .     the gi bill delay shows how a tweak to these dated systems can be complicated and time-consuming . there \u2019 s likely little appetite in congress to tackle the daunting task of modernization , but leadership is sorely needed ."}, {"url": "file://val/0/1/1", "title": "val/0/1/1", "content": "breaking news emails get breaking news alerts and special reports . the news and stories that matter , delivered weekday mornings .     nov. 29 , 2018 , 1 : 40 am gmt / updated nov. 29 , 2018 , 1 : 52 am gmt by phil mccausland     for weeks , student veterans across the country have raised an alarm about delayed or incorrect gi bill benefit payments , which the department of veterans affairs has blamed on computer issues .     but on wednesday , the department told congressional staffers that it would not reimburse those veterans who were paid less than they were owed , two committee aides told nbc news .     the news conflicts with a promise va officials made to a house committee earlier this month that it would reimburse those veterans who received less than the full amount they were due .     according to the aides , however , the va said it could not make retroactive payments without auditing its previous education claims , which it said would delay future claims . the aides asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly .     nbc news previously reported that some veterans were forced into desperate financial straits stemming from a change in calculating housing allowances under the forever gi bill , which president donald trump signed into law in july 2017. when its computers were unable to process that change , the va quickly faced a backlog of veterans \u2019 claims three times higher than normal .     because of those issues , the va had announced earlier on wednesday that it would delay the forever gi bill housing allowance changes until december 2019 \u2014 and again promised that retroactive payments would be made to those who did not receive a correct amount .     but va officials told congressional staffers in a telephone call on wednesday morning that once the system is made right next year , they will not make retroactive payments to those who were underpaid because of the housing miscalculations .     \" they are essentially going to ignore the law and say that that change only goes forward from december 2019 , \" one aide told nbc news .     the reason the va decided that it would not make the retroactive payments is because it would have to audit all its previous education claims prior to december 2019 , meaning the va would potentially have to inspect 2 million claims , the aide said .     va officials said this could cause further delays in processing future claims , according to the aides , an issue that caused some veterans to suffer earlier this year .     while this decision could mean the agency is flouting the law because it would not provide the correct amount of money to student veterans as required by two sections of the forever gi bill , the va told the congressional staffers that they have a legal justification that would allow them to move forward with this decision .     they did not share that justification , however .     when asked for comment , a va spokesman did not address the issue directly . instead he reiterated that the agency would delay paying housing allowances in accordance with the new forever gi bill until the spring term of 2020 and instead pay housing allowances based on department of defense ' s older basic housing allowance rates .     attempting to implement the law would put \u201can enormous administrative burden for schools in which some 35,000 certifying officials would have to track retroactively and re-certify hundreds of thousands of enrollment documents , \u201d curtis cashour , the va spokesman , said over email .     cashour also said that students who were overpaid because of the law \u2019 s changes or because of issues in implementing the law \u201cwill not be held liable for the debt. \u201d     but he did not comment on those who were underpaid and rampant confusion continues to surround the issue , as it is unknown how many students have been underpaid thus far , how many more could be underpaid because of the changes to the law and how much money these veterans are owed .     congressional aides described the situation as \u201cfrustrating. \u201d one , who commented on the shifting answers and constant confusion stemming from va , asked , \u201ci mean , am i taking crazy pills ? \u201d     under secretary for benefits paul lawrence is scheduled to testify thursday morning before the house committee on veterans \u2019 affairs .     one of the committee aides said that members of congress will attempt to clear this issue up before they move forward with the hearing .     \u201cthey need to figure it out , \u201d the aide said ."}], "bhushan": [{"url": "file://val/0/1/2", "title": "val/0/1/2",

not be able to implement the fix until december 2019.     the big delay comes after months of technology hiccups that have plagued the agency , which failed to meet the original aug. 1 deadline to put the changes in place . these problems have contributed to a backlog of claims for veterans using the post-9/11 gi bill to attend school this fall , and the agency has come under fire in recent months

so stressed about money that he made a \u201cspur of the moment decision \u201d and dropped out of all his classes .     it was already october and he hadn \u2019 t received his gi bill benefits for the start of his fall semester at austin peay state university in clarksville .     the 30-year-old communications major and his wife , in her last semester of nursing school , are full-time students

campbell for four years .     he wanted to take advantage of his gi bill so he enrolled for classes just a month after the army discharged him . but the money never came , he said .     \" we were just shocked . we were angry because we figured this would be automatic , \" baker said . \" come to find out , there were big problems going on at the va. \"     there are many veterans , like baker , in tennessee and across the country who are still waiting for the department of veterans affairs to clear a backlog created after president donald trump signed the forever gi bill in 2017.     while the landmark legislation expanded benefits for a new generation of veterans and their families , it didn \u2019 t upgrade the va \u2019 s antiquated technical capabilities to account for those changes .     problems are centered within the va \u2019 s office of information technology , which is tasked with implementing the change to how housing allowances are calculated , the va said .     the new bill changed it so that veterans housing would be based on the school \u2019 s zip code , rather that where the veteran lived . problems arose when the va attempted to stress test their outdated system , as well as a contract dispute . as a result , the va waited until july 16 to tell schools to begin enrolling students .     the delay caused a backlog of claims , meaning thousands of students had to wait for their benefits just as they were headed back to school for the fall semester . post-sept. 11 military-affiliated students , particularly first-time students like baker , were mostly impacted .     on nov. 14 , state rep. jay reedy , r-erin , and leaders in the tennessee house and senate wrote a letter to u.s. rep. phil roe , r-johnson city , and members of the house committee on veterans affairs urging them to take immediate action . roe chairs the committee .     nationally there are fewer than 1,000 veterans who have an education claim that has been pending over 60 days and less than 10,000 who have a claim that \u2019 s been pending for over 30 days , as of nov. 28 , according to va spokesman curt cashour .     universities step in to help students     but where the va failed , universities across the state have stepped up to help students .     many schools are utilizing 0 percent interest loans and tuition deferment as ways to ensure student veterans receive the financial support they need continue their education .     as a result , institutional funds at several schools have been heavily drawn down , creating budget concerns .     baker said after he dropped his classes , he came to the realization that he would have to pay the school back for the months he ' s already been in class .     \" it was just going to hurt me more financially . i was freaking out and called admissions , \" he said . \" they said ' it ' s ok. we ' ll fix it.
